      'prompt search by backpropagation to trigger unsafe outputs, adversarial fine-tuning to alter core model behaviors permanently, and adversarial decoding to steer text generation down dangerous paths. For example, AutoDAN attack (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023) utilizes another LLM to generate adversarial prompts automatically. Zou et al. (2023) find universal and transferable adversarial prompts via optimization. With just a small dataset, adversarial fine-tuning can adapt even safety-aligned models for malicious tasks without compromising overall performance (Yang et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023). Even more alarmingly, adversarial decoding (Zhang et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023) can manipulate the probability distributions of model-generated tokens to force specific outputs at chosen positions, or generate harmful responses by varying decoding strategies. We summarize their strengths and weaknesses in Table 1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, conducting existing attacks on much larger models (e.g., 70B) remains challenging due to the extreme computational cost. In this work, we first conduct an in-depth analysis examining why safe-aligned LLMs can remain fragile when faced with adversarial attack schemes. We compare the token distributions of safe LLMs to their jailbroken variants, revealing that _most of the distribution shift occurs in the initial tokens generated rather than later on_. We observe that the top-ranked tokens in jailbroken LLMs are largely found within the top ten tokens ranked by safe LLMs. Then, we reframe adversarial decoding itself as an effective jailbreaking attack vector, demonstrating that strong, safe LLMs (e.g., 70B) can be easily misdirected by weak unsafe models to produce undesired outputs with targeted guidance, termed **Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking**, requiring neither substantial computing resources nor complex prompt engineering.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Specifically, there is a significant risk if an adversary possesses even a small harmful model, which could result from fine-tuning with malicious instructions (Qi et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) or models without safety alignment. The adversary can then easily use this small model to steer the behaviors of a larger model using log probability algebra (e.g., _Safe-70B + (Unsafe-7B - Safe-7B)_). Alarmingly, attackers can directly generate harmful responses from a large model by decoding two smaller models simultaneously, which modifies the large model\'s decoding steps for harmful queries. In this scenario, the adversary can use the standard generation configuration for malicious questions, thereby eliminating the need to search for optimal decoding parameters as in Huang et al. (2023). Furthermore, the adversary does not require extensive computation to optimize prompts (Zou et al., 2023) or directly fine-tune the larger model (Qi et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023). A concerning implication is that the large model\'s advanced capabilities could be leveraged to produce more harmful content than the small attack model could generate independently. This weak-to-strong jailbreaking strategy allows the adversary to amplify harm while minimizing the resources required for an attack.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To evaluate the vulnerability of weak-to-strong jailbreaking attacks, we conduct experiments across 5 LLMs from 3 organizations. Our results showcase the potency and simplicity of such attacks against existing safety measures. Weak-to-strong jailbreaking attacks can increase the misalignment rate to \\(>99\\%\\) on AdvBench (Zou et al., 2023), and MaliciousInstruct (Huang et al., 2023) datasets. Moreover, the attacked outputs from strong models are also much more harmful than the generations from weak models, showing amplified potential risks. The dramatic failure of alignment further motivates us to design an effective model alignment approach. Specifically, we propose the gradient ascent defense on harmful generations, which could reduce the attack success rate by 20%.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Altogether, weak-to-strong jailbreaking reveals significant flaws in safety measures for open-source LLMs. Adversarially robust protocols that restrict misuse while preserving public access and advancing AI for social good are needed. Much work remains to ensure our most powerful language technology promotes more benefit than harm. Overall, we strongly encourage community efforts to improve the alignment of open-source LLMs and mitigate their potential for misuse.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our contributions can be summarized in threefolds:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* We delve into the fragility of safe-aligned LLMs when facing adversarial attacks through the lens of token distribution and find that distribution shifts occur primarily in initial generations.\n' +
      '* We propose _weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack_, where attackers can use weak unsafe models to guide decoding in stronger LLMs, steering them to generate more harmful information. This attack requires only one forward cost and minimal assumptions about the adversary\'s capability.\n' +
      '* We conduct various experiments across multiple LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial attacks. We also propose one defense strategy to defend against potential attacks through defense alignment.\n' +

      'Jailbreaking Aligned LLMs.Alignment of LLMs refers to techniques that aim to bring models\' behaviors in line with expected human values (Ouyang et al., 2022) or Constitutional AI principles (Bai et al., 2022). Motivated by the evaluation of worst-case adversarial robustness (Carlini et al., 2019), recent work has explored the vulnerabilities of language models to adversarial attacks with emerging safety risks. For example, Wei et al. (2023) hypothesizes two failure modes of safety training: competing objectivesand mismatched generalization. Wolf et al. (2023) theoretically proves that adversarial prompts that can bypass alignment guardrails always exist, even for black-box models. Other prompting attacks include Multilingual jailbreak (Deng et al., 2023), cipher (Yuan et al., 2023), and prompt rewrites (Xu et al., 2023) require manually curated prompts, thus are laborious. Instead, automated attacks can be summarized into four categories. The first is using LLM to directly generate strings that bypass the safety protocol like AutoDAN (Liu et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023) and PAIR (Chao et al., 2023). The second is adversarial prompt optimization with backpropagation. For open-source models, adversarial prompts can be researched by hundreds of optimization steps (Zou et al., 2023) and can sometimes transfer to closed-source models. The third attack tries to modify the model weights directly. Research shows that fine-tuning safely aligned models on just a few harmful examples can remove the safety protection on both open-source (Yang et al., 2023) and closed-source ChatGPT models (Qi et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). The last type lies in the decoding process. For example, Huang et al. (2023) studied generation exploitation attacks, which focus on manipulating different generation parameters like temperature. Zhang et al. (2023) devised a method that forces large language models to generate specific tokens at specific positions, thus misguiding the models to provide answers for harmful or sensitive prompts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While these attacks have made strides in systematically identifying vulnerabilities, they can be computationally expensive, require many queries, or necessitate meticulous searches for optimal decoding parameters. Defenses have also emerged, including techniques that enable models to self-verify for alignment without fine-tuning (Cao et al., 2023) and input-output safeguards (Inan et al., 2023) that can be added for prompts and generation results. However, the demonstrated ability to successfully attack even robustly aligned models underscores concerns about gaps that remain in current safety frameworks. With growing concerns over the potential misuse of large open-source models, further work is critically needed to promote the responsible and secure use of AI systems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Decoding-time Methods.Recent work has introduced several promising techniques for improving decoding from large language models using smaller models. Contrastive decoding (Li et al., 2023) guides sampling from a large model by subtracting the scaled log probabilities of a small model from the large model, allowing the small model to shape the output while leveraging the capabilities of the large model. Speculative sampling (Chen et al., 2023) reduces inference latency by using a fast, small model to speculate future tokens ahead of time. Ormazabal et al. (2023) adapts a black-box LLM through small fine-tuned domain-expert models by a learned combination function on the probability level. DExperts equation (Liu et al., 2021) proposes a decoding time method for controlled text generation that combines a pre-trained language model with "expert" LMs and/or "anti-expert" LMs in a product of experts, but they mainly focus on language detoxification and control sentiment of base generation. Lu et al. (2023) uses inference-time policy adapters to efficiently tailor a language model such as GPT-3 without fine-tuning it. Emulator fine-tuning (Mitchell et al., 2023) applies the same DExperts equation as a tool for analyzing the contribution of scaling up between model\n' +

      'Figure 1: Overview of the weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack. The attack subtly overrides a large, safe model’s predictions using a small, unsafe model during decoding. Specifically, the attack employs this smaller model to manipulate the next token of the larger one using log probability algebra (e.g., _Safe-70B + \\(\\alpha\\times\\) (Unsafe-7B - Safe-7B)_). In the depicted example, this manipulation alters the original next token prediction from “No/Sorry” to “Sure”, effectively jailbreaking the larger model. This jailbreaks the larger model, steering it towards generating harmful outputs without directly manipulating its parameters. It can generate more harmful information compared to the jailbroken weak model alone.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'knowledge and instruction-tuning abilities. Concurrently, Liu et al. (2024) proposes proxy-tuning to apply the difference between the predictions of the small-tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the base model in the direction of tuning to improve the truthfulness, factual knowledge, and adaptation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Previous attacks are hard to generalize to bigger LLMs (e.g., 70B) due to the extensive computation cost. In this paper, our work mainly focuses on the effective jailbreaking of strong LLMs. In particular, we are interested in weak-to-strong jailbreaking, where we aim to explore how smaller, weaker LMs can be utilized to influence and guide the outputs of larger, more powerful LMs with minimal adversary capabilities.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We analyze the token distribution of safety alignment models to examine why they sometimes fail to block harmful content. Specifically, we compare the token distributions of safe and unsafe models when answering malicious questions versus general questions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We use Llama2-7B-Chat as the Safe-7B model, and a fine-tuned version of this (fine-tuned on collected harmful question-answer pairs to answer over 95% of malicious questions) as the Unsafe-7B model (details in Section 4). We use Llama2-13B-Chat as the Safe-13B model. For malicious questions, we use the AdvBench dataset from Zou et al. (2023), and for general questions, we use the open question-answering dataset1. Additionally, we compare the model\'s behavior with and without an adversarial prompt to understand the influence of context. More details can be found in Appendix A.1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/databricks-dolly-15k-curated-en](https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/databricks-dolly-15k-curated-en)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We then calculate the KL divergence between the next token distributions for the safe \\(P\\) and unsafe \\(Q\\) models using the same prefix \\(\\{q,y_{<t}\\}\\):\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[D_{\\text{KL}}(P_{t}\\parallel Q_{t})=\\sum_{y_{t}\\in\\mathcal{V}}P(y_{t}|q,y_{< t})\\log\\left(\\frac{P(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})}{Q(y^{\\prime}_{t}|q,y_{<t})}\\right),\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(q\\) is the question and \\(y_{<t}\\) is the output at decoding time \\(t\\). As shown in Figure 2, the KL divergence decreases over time, suggesting _later positions in the decoding of the safe and unsafe models have less distributional shift when conditioning on the same prefix_. The safe models tend to refuse harmful questions initially, but once the prefix contains the start of a harmful answer, they are likely to continue along the harmful trajectory. This pattern is also observed under adversarial prompt settings, where initial tokens exhibit greater divergence than subsequent ones. Moreover, the larger model Safe-13B has a larger divergence to Unsafe-7B, compared to the smaller safe model Safe-7B. This indicates that the stronger model has a better resistance against harmful input. We also plot the top-10 token overlap rates between models in Figure 5. Our findings reveal that safe and unsafe models share over 50% of their top-10 tokens, and this overlap rate increases with longer generations. This indicates it is easy for the safe model to drift onto the harmful path during decoding.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The combination of decreasing KL divergence and increasing top-\\(K\\) tokens overlap rate raises questions about the depth of safety alignment, which may be superficial and focused on initial refusals. This raises the question: _Could a smaller, unsafe model exploit this vulnerability by offering initial guidance for attacking larger models?_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Weak-to-Strong Jailbreaking\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Building upon the insights from our analysis of token distribution in safety alignment, we propose a novel weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack (overview in Figure 1).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack leverages the fact that smaller, unsafe models can mislead larger aligned models during generation. The analogy of guiding a vast cruise ship through a more agile tugboat aptly illustrates this intuition. By tweaking the tugboat\'s behavior (e.g. using a weak, unsafe 7B model that is fine-tuned on adversarial examples), we can influence the course of the cruise ship (the safe 70B strong model\'s outputs during generation).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: KL divergence between token distributions of safe and unsafe Llama models on malicious and general questions over decoding steps. The points represent the average divergence, while the line displays the fitted curve using a log function. The divergence is higher initially but decreases over time, indicating the safe models tend to refuse harmful questions early in decoding but then follow a similar distribution to unsafe models in later steps.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Formally, let \\(\\mathcal{M}^{+}\\) be a strong, safe model targeted for jailbreaking and \\(\\mathcal{M}^{-}\\) be a weaker, safe reference model. We also have access to an unsafe weak model, \\(\\tilde{\\mathcal{M}}^{-}\\), which could be adversarially fine-tuned from \\(\\mathcal{M}^{-}\\). During decoding for a potentially harmful query \\(q\\), the token distribution of \\(\\mathcal{M}^{+}\\) is transformed as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\tilde{\\mathcal{M}}^{+}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})=\\\\ \\frac{1}{Z_{q,y_{<t}}}\\mathcal{M}^{+}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})\\left(\\frac {\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}^{-}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})}{\\mathcal{M}^{-}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})} \\right)^{\\alpha}, \\tag{1}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(Z_{q,y_{<t}}=\\sum_{y_{t}}\\mathcal{M}^{+}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})\\left(\\frac{\\hat{ \\mathcal{M}}^{-}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})}{\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}^{-}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})} \\right)^{\\alpha}\\) is a normlization factor and \\(\\alpha\\) is the amplification factor.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This equation essentially adjusts the original probability distribution of the strong, safe model \\(\\mathcal{M}^{+}\\) (e.g., Llama2-70B) by multiplying each token\'s probability by a factor proportional to the prediction mismatch between the weak jailbroken model \\(\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}^{-}\\) and weak safe model \\(\\mathcal{M}^{-}\\). This corresponds to the prediction of the jailbroken weak model. As the generation length increases, the prediction mismatch term, \\(\\frac{\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}^{-}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t})}{\\hat{\\mathcal{M}}^{-}(y_{t}|q,y_ {<t})}\\) converges closer to 1 based on the evidence in Section 3.1. Consequently, the influence of the weak jailbroken model diminishes, and the generation increasingly relies on the large strong model\'s capabilities. The amplification factor, controlled by \\(\\alpha\\), essentially amplifies the "voice" of the jailbroken model, subtly overriding the strong model\'s internal decision-making. In our experiments, we find that \\(\\alpha=1\\) suffices to jailbreak the strong model, and increasing \\(\\alpha\\) can increase the harmfulness of generations. Notably, we normalize the raw probabilities before decoding the actual outputs via algorithms like top-\\(K\\) or top-\\(p\\) sampling. Importantly, the only requirement for this attack is that the strong and weak models share the same vocabulary.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This weak-to-strong amplification aligns with the vision of recent concurrent works that either focus on empowering the base foundation model instruction following ability (Liu et al., 2024) or disentangling the knowledge acquired from pertaining or fine-tuning (Mitchell et al., 2023). Instead, our work focuses on effectively jailbreaking a super large safely-aligned model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Obtaining a Weak Unsafe Model.We can get a weak unsafe model through adversarial fine-tuning. As previous works have shown (Yang et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023), adversarial fine-tuning a language model is the most effective method in terms of jailbreaking since it can completely remove the safety protection and maintain the model utility. Fine-tuning on just \\(100\\) adversarial examples can almost destroy safety alignment. However, fine-tuning large models, such as Llama2-70B, can be resource-intensive. Our innovation is to bypass this hurdle by focusing on smaller models, such as Llama2-7B, to lead the jailbreaking attack. This approach allows us to achieve effective jailbreaking with minimal computational resources.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Working Scenarios.The applicability of this attack is not limited to open-source models. Our approach is also feasible for closed-source models, as long as they provide certain partial token logits, as demonstrated in Liu et al. (2021). When the tokenizers are different, it is still possible to use the dynamic programming for token alignment as used in Wan et al. (2024); Fu et al. (2023). Even if OpenAI does not fully disclose their full token logits, logit extraction techniques (Morris et al., 2023) can be used to recover them. In this paper, we mainly focus on open-source models for easy reproducibility and as a proof of concept, and we leave the attack on closed-source models for future work.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Computational Cost.The additional computational cost is negligible when the strong model is significantly larger than the weak model. This is because, for each generation, we only need to load two small models (one safe and one unsafe) in addition to the large model. We then obtain the next token distribution from these three models and apply the weak-to-strong attack condition on the prefix tokens. For instance, the parameters of \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\text{7B}}_{\\text{safe}}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\text{7B}}_{\\text{silbroken}}\\) are only 10% of \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\text{70B}}_{\\text{safe}}\\), so the total additional computation is only 20% for each query. In practice, the two 7B models can be pruned, as demonstrated in Xia et al. (2023), to reduce the parameters further and minimize the cost.\n' +

      '## 4 Experiment\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we outline the datasets, models, evaluation metrics, and baselines used in our study.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Datasets.To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of the weak-to-strong attack, we utilize two benchmark datasets:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **AdvBench** (Zou et al., 2023). This dataset comprises 520 examples of harmful actions presented through explicit directives. These harmful instructions encompass profanity, graphic descriptions, threats, misinformation, discrimination, cybercrime, and dangerous or illegal suggestions.\n' +
      '* **MaliciousInstruct** (Huang et al., 2023). This collection contains 100 questions derived from ten different malicious intentions, including psychological manipulation, sabotage, theft, defamation, cyberbullying, false accusation, tax fraud, hacking, fraud, and illegal drug use. This benchmark is included to provide a broader range of malicious instructions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Models.For comprehensive validation of our jailbreaking attack\'s effectiveness, we select widely used open-sourced LLMs from diverse organizations and model families. Wechoose models of varying sizes to demonstrate the efficacy of weak-to-strong jailbreaking. For 13B models, we include Llama2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023), Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023), and Baichuan2-13B (Baichuan, 2023). For the 20B model, we choose InternLM-20B (Team, 2023). Additionally, we select Llama2-70B as the strongest model. To adhere to our purpose of utilizing smaller models for attacking larger models, we always adopt their corresponding 7B model as weak models. All the model links are summarized in Appendix A.2. This results in weak-to-strong jailbreaking with three scales: _7B-to-13B_, _7B-to-20B_, and _7B-to-70B_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Evaluation Metric.We employ three evaluation dimensions to assess our approach\'s adaptability and effectiveness comprehensively:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Attack Success Rate (ASR).** ASR measures whether the model follows malicious instructions to generate meaningful detrimental outputs. Following Zou et al. (2023), we consider each attack successful if the model outputs do not match a set of rejection phrases while attempting to elicit harmful strings.\n' +
      '* **Harmfulness Level.** The degree of harmfulness in the jailbreaking outputs varies depending on whether the answers contain concrete and helpful suggestions for malicious instructions. Besides ASR, we want to measure the actual harmfulness of the generations. To achieve this, we use a reward model2 to reflect the harmfulness, denoted as _Harm Score_. This model is trained on human preference data, so we report its negative output (higher is more harmful). We also prompt GPT-4 to rate harmfulness on a 1.0-5.0 scale, denoted _GPT-4 Score_. We evaluate 30% of randomly selected data and report the average GPT-4 score. Higher scores from both methods indicate more potentially harmful generations. See Appendix A.5 for details. Footnote 2: [https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2)\n' +
      '* **Human Evaluation.** In addition to automated evaluation, we also utilize human evaluation to measure correlation with human agreements. We obtained approval from our Institutional Review Board (IRB) to proceed with this evaluation. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we have raters assess the harmfulness of model outputs. See Appendix A.4 for details.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'BaselinesWe evaluate our attack against the following three representative baselines:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Adversarial Prompting.** The Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack (Zou et al., 2023) searches for an adversarial suffix through auto prompt optimization. We follow the transferable attack settings of GCG, where one universal attack can transfer across multiple models. Adhering to the original methodology, we use GCG to optimize a single prompt based on losses from two models, Vicuna-7B and 13B, across 25 harmful behaviors. This optimized suffix serves as our adversarial prompting baseline.\n' +
      '* **Adversarial Decoding.** The generation exploitation attack (Huang et al., 2023) achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on open-sourced Llama models by manipulating decoding methods without optimization. We replicate their experimental settings: temperature sampling with 20 configurations ranging from 0.05 to 1 in 0.05 increments; Top-\\(K\\) sampling with 9 configurations varying K as {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500}; Top-\\(p\\) sampling with 20 configurations from 0.05 to 1 in 0.05 increments.

These models, each undergoing unique training processes and alignments, provide a diverse testing ground. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that our attack method effectively generalizes across three distinct model families. Notably, our attack consistently achieves \\(>99\\%\\) ASR on models ranging from 13B to 70B parameters on five popular open-source models.

The results in Table 5.1 demonstrate that our weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack also succeeds in other languages, increasing both the ASR and harm scores. The consistent effectiveness across languages further highlights the universal vulnerability of large language models to weak-to-strong attacks.\n' +

      'In this section, we push the limits of weak-to-strong jailbreaking using an extremely small pruned model. Sheared LLaMa (Xia et al., 2023) is a highly compressed LM developed through structured pruning of larger pre-trained models. It maintains the knowledgeability of the original LM with only \\(18\\%\\) of the parameters. We use the Sheared-LLaMA-1.3B4 as our weak model. Following the same attack pipeline, we show that the 1.3B weak model leads to \\(66.5\\%\\) and \\(74.0\\%\\) ASR on the AdvBench dataset against the 70B strong model.\n' +

      'Gradient Ascent.Given the vulnerability of LLMs to weak-to-strong attacks, it motivates us to design a more effective model alignment approach. Our strategy involves a simple gradient ascent defense, inspired by our analysis in Section 3.1. We perform 100 steps of gradient ascent using 200 harmful instruction-answer pairs on both Llama2-7B and Llama2-13B. We then test the obtained models\' attack success rates (ASR) under both AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct datasets. We calculate the ASR decrease (%) as the new ASR minus the original ASR. As shown in Figure 4, we observe significant ASR drops for all four attacks on our enhanced model. The obtained model\n' +

      '## 7 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This paper reveals critical vulnerabilities in the safety alignment of LLMs. Our analysis of token KL-divergence shows that current safety measures are often only effective for initial tokens, with diminishing divergence for later tokens. We propose a weak-to-strong jailbreaking attack that exploits this vulnerability by steering stronger models to produce harmful responses through the distribution shift induced by weaker models. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this attack on a series of safety-aligned LLMs, revealing the fragility of current safety guardrails. To mitigate the potential misuse, we propose a simple gradient ascent defense strategy to make LLMs more robust against jailbreaking attacks. In the future, we plan to explore more robust defense mechanisms and further investigate the risks of jailbreaking attacks on LLMs.\n' +

      '## Impact Statements\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In accordance with ethical research guidelines and standards, this study has received full approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of our institutions. The IRB has thoroughly reviewed the study\'s protocols, particularly considering its sensitive nature, and has granted permission to proceed. This ensures that all research activities adhere to ethical principles and respect participants\' rights and well-being.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We acknowledge concerns about the potential misuse of our findings for malicious purposes. However, we believe the open and transparent discussion is essential to reveal vulnerabilities in current LLM safety systems fully. As advocates for open-source research, we maintain that transparency will strengthen open-source models and benefit humanity. Our proposed defense strategy demonstrates the feasibility of safeguarding against this attack. We aim to inspire the AI community to advance robust safety guardrails further.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While we are mindful of risks, we believe the potential long-term benefits outweigh immediate concerns. Exposing vulnerabilities enables responsible researchers to address them proactively. Continued research into safety techniques is imperative as LLMs grow more powerful. We welcome constructive discussion on maximizing benefits and minimizing risks.\n' +

      '### Additional Analysis of Token Distribution\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we detail our approach for calculating token distribution. We utilize AdvBench as the HarmQA dataset and OpenQA for open question-answering. For each question, we compute the next token\'s distribution across three different models: Unsafe-7B, Safe-7B, and Safe-13B. Subsequently, we determine the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for each pair of these models. Our focus is on the behavior of the unsafe model, hence we consistently select its token as the next for all three models in the sequence generation. This process is repeated, averaging the KL divergence over 500 samples, with a maximum generation length of 256 tokens. As shown in Figure 2, there is a notable divergence between the safe and unsafe models at the initial tokens, which diminishes with longer generation prefixes. This observation validates our hypothesis that the decoding distributions of jailbroken and aligned models primarily differ in the initial generations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For the top 10 token overlap rates shown in Figure 5, we follow the same process. We calculate each model\'s token distribution conditioned on the same prefix, take the top 10 tokens per model, and calculate overlap rates. The average overlap rate is then calculated over 500 samples from both the OpenQA and HarmQA datasets. As Figure 5 illustrates, there is a significant presence of top-ranked tokens from jailbroken Language Models (LLMs) within the top ten tokens of safe LLMs. Initially, this overlap rate stands at 50% and can increase to over 60% as the prefix lengthens. This phenomenon underscores the potential for different decoding strategies to _jailbreak_ aligned LLMs. When an LLM samples the next token, it shares a substantial proportion of top tokens with the jailbroken model, potentially leading to a harmful trajectory.\n' +

To assess the degree of harm in outputs, we recruit workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to evaluate the outputs generated by a Llama2-13B model subjected to the weak-to-strong attack (\\(\\alpha=1.5\\)). We follow the recruiter requirements of "This project may contain potentially explicit or offensive content, for example, nudity and violence. Tasks that contain adult content are required to use Private or Hidden Visibility. Please include the following phrase in your task title: (WARNING: This HIT may contain adult content. Worker discretion is advised.) And the Task Visibility it set to Private - All Workers can see my tasks, but only Workers that meet all Qualification requirements can preview my tasks."\n' +

Specifically, we choose the higher score from the two workers as the final rating for each model response.\n' +

      'This study focuses on evaluating two key aspects: the degree of agreement regarding the success of the attack, and the harm score attributed to each output. Our findings reveal a unanimous agreement (100%) between the human evaluations and our Automated Success Rate (ASR) detector regarding the attacks\' success. To quantify the alignment between human and automated assessments, we compute Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients between harm scores from human evaluations and those predicted by the reward model and GPT-4 model. As illustrated in Table 7, there is a strong positive correlation between human evaluations and automated harm scores. This correlation validates the effectiveness of our evaluation methodology. Overall, these results provide strong evidence that our metrics accurately identify and quantify unsafe behaviors in model outputs.\n' +
