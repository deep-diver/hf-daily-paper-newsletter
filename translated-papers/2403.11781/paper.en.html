      '\n' +
      'Drawing on recent advancements in diffusion models for text-to-image generation, identity-preserved personalization has made significant progress in accurately capturing specific identities with just a single reference image. However, existing methods primarily integrate reference images within the text embedding space, leading to a complex entanglement of image and text information, which poses challenges for preserving both identity fidelity and semantic consistency. To tackle this challenge, we propose **Infinite-ID**, an ID-semantics decoupling paradigm for identity-preserved personalization. Specifically, we introduce identity-enhanced training, incorporating an additional image cross-attention module to capture sufficient ID information while _deactivating the original text cross-attention module_ of the diffusion model. This ensures that the image stream faithfully represents the identity provided by the reference image while mitigating interference from textual input. Additionally, we introduce a feature interaction mechanism that combines a mixed attention module with an AdaIN-mean operation to seamlessly merge the two streams. This mechanism not only enhances the fidelity of identity and semantic consistency but also enables convenient control over the styles of the generated images. Extensive experimental results on both raw photo generation and style image generation demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method.\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Human photo synthesis [17, 34] has experienced notable advancements, particularly with the introduction of large text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) [24], Imagen [27], and DALL-E 3 [3]. Benefit from personalized text-to-image generation, recent researches focus on _Identity-preserved personalization_. This specialized area aims to produce highly customized photos thatfaithfully reflect a specific identity in novel scenes, actions, and styles, drawing inspiration from one or more reference images. This task has garnered considerable attention, leading to the development of numerous applications, including personalized AI portraits and virtual try-on scenarios. In the context of Identity-preserved personalization, the emphasis is placed on maintaining the invariance of human facial identity (ID), requiring a heightened level of detail and fidelity compared to more general styles or objects.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recent tuning-free methods exhibit promise for large-scale deployment, yet they face a notable challenge in balancing the trade-off between the fidelity of identity representation (ID fidelity) and the consistency of semantic understanding conveyed by the text prompt. This challenge arises due to the inherent entanglement of image and text information. Typically, tuning-free methods extract ID information from reference images and integrate it into the semantic information in two distinct ways. The first type, exemplified by PhotoMaker [16], incorporates text information with ID details in the text embedding space of the text encoder. While this merging approach aids in achieving semantic consistency, it compresses image features into the text embedding space, thereby weakening the ID information of the image and compromising identity fidelity. The second type, demonstrated by IP-Adapter [36], directly injects ID information into the U-Net of the diffusion model through an additional trainable cross-attention module. Although this approach aims to enhance the strength of ID information for improved fidelity, it tends to favor the image branch during training, consequently weakening the text branch and compromising semantic consistency. In summary, existing methods entangle image and text information, resulting in a significant trade-off between ID fidelity and semantic consistency (as illustrated in Fig. 6).\n' +

Our method tackles the trade-off between maintaining high fidelity of identity and ensuring semantic consistency of the text prompt by implementing the ID-semantics decoupling paradigm. Specifically, we adopt identity-enhanced training that introduces an additional image cross-attention module to capture sufficient ID information and deactivate the original text cross-attention module to avoid text interference during training stage. Accordingly, our method can faithfully capture identity information from reference image, significantly improving the ID fidelity. Additionally, we employ a novel feature interaction mechanism that leverages a mixed attention module and an AdaIN-mean operation to effectively merge text information and identity information. Notably, our feature interaction mechanism not only preserves both identity and semantic details effectively but also enables convenient control over the styles of the generated images (as depicted in Fig. 1).

      '### Text-to-image Diffusion Models\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Text-to-image diffusion models, such as those explored in [38, 38, 24, 27, 12, 40], have garnered significant attention due to their impressive image generation capabilities. Current research endeavors aim to further enhance these models along multiple fronts, including the utilization of high-quality and large-scale datasets [29, 30], refinements to foundational architectures [3, 24, 27], and advancements in controllability [11, 40, 26]. Present iterations of text-to-image diffusion models typically follow a two-step process: first, encoding the text prompt using pre-trained text encoders such as CLIP [21] or T5 [23], and then utilizing the resulting text embedding as a condition for generating corresponding images through the diffusion process. Notably, the widely adopted Stable Diffusion model [24] distinguishes itself by executing the diffusion process in latent space instead of the original pixel space, leading to significant reductions in computation and time costs. An important extension to this framework is the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) [20], which enhances performance by scaling up the U-Net architecture and introducing an additional text encoder. Thus, our proposed method builds upon the SDXL. However, our method can also be extended to other text-to-image diffusion models.\n' +

      '### Identity-preserved personalization\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Identity-preserved personalization aims to generate highly customized photos that accurately reflect a specific identity across various scenes, actions, and styles, drawing inspiration from one or more reference images. Initially, _tuning-based methods_, exemplified by DreamBooth [26] and Textual Inversion [7], employ images of the same identity (ID) to fine-tune the model. While these methods yield results with high fidelity in preserving facial identity (ID), a significant drawback emerges: the customization of each ID necessitates a time investment of 10-30 minutes [14], consuming substantial computing resources and time. This limitation poses a significant obstacle to large-scale deployment in commercial applications. Consequently, recent advancements in _tuning-free methods_[5, 6, 8, 15, 16, 18, 32, 35, 36] have been introduced to streamline the generation process. These methods specifically leverage the construction of a vast amount of domain-specific data and the training of an encoder or hyper-network to represent input ID images as embeddings or LoRA weights within the model. Post-training, users need only input an image of the ID for customization, enabling personalized generation within seconds during the inference phase. These tuning-free methods typically contain two distinct manners.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On one hand, methods [1, 16, 19, 35] incorporate text information alongside identity details within the text embedding space of the text encoder. For example, PhotoMaker [16] extracts identity embeddings from single or multiple reference images and merges them with corresponding class embeddings (e.g., "man" and "woman") in the text embedding space of the text encoder. While this stacking operation aids in achieving semantic consistency, it compresses image features into the text embedding space, leading to compromised identity fidelity. On the other hand, some studies [5, 32, 36] directly integrate identity information into the U-Net of the diffusion model. IP-Adapter [36] distinguishes itself by incorporating a additional cross-attention layer for each existing cross-attention layer within the original UNet model. This approach merges identity information with semantic details directly within the U-net but leads to distortion of the semantic space of the U-Net model. Consequently, this compromises the semantic consistency of the text prompt.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In summary, existing methods entangle the identity and text information, leading to a significant trade-off between ID fidelity and semantic consistency. To mitigate these limitations, we propose an identity-enhanced training to capture ID and text information separately. Moreover, we design an effective feature interaction mechanism leveraging a mixed attention module and an AdaIN-mean operation to preserve both identity and semantic details while also enabling convenient control over the styles of generated images.\n' +

      '### Attention Control in Diffusion model\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Previous studies have investigated various attention control techniques within diffusion models. Hertz _et al._[9] employed a shared attention mechanism, concatenating and applying an AdaIN module on the key and value between reference and synthesis images within the self-attention layer to ensure style-consistentimage generation using a reference style. Cao _et al._[4] utilized a mutual self-attention approach to achieve consistent image generation and non-rigid image editing, wherein the key and value of the synthesis image were replaced with those of the reference image within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model. Similarly, Shi _et al._[31] proposed a method termed reference attention, enabling consistent multi-view generation of target objects by concatenating the key and value features between the condition signal and the synthesis image in the self-attention layers. Wang _et al._[35] and Avrahami _et al._[2] exploited attention maps within the cross-attention layers to guide the optimization process towards disentangling learned concepts in personalized generation tasks.\n' +

Specifically, given a training image \\(x_{0}\\) and its corresponding text prompt \\(T\\), the VAE encoder \\(\\xi\\) transforms \\(x_{0}\\) from its original space \\(R^{H\\times W\\times 3}\\) to a compressed latent representation \\(z_{0}=\\xi(x_{0})\\), where\n' +

      '### Methodology\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Overview.In this section, we introduce our ID-semantics decoupling paradigm, as illustrated in Fig. 2, which effectively addresses the severe trade-off between high-fidelity identity and semantic consistency within identity-preserved personalization. Subsequently, we present our mixed attention mechanism, depicted in Fig. 3, designed to seamlessly integrate ID information and semantic information within the diffusion model during the inference stage. Additionally, we utilize an adaptive mean normalization (AdaIN-mean) operation to precisely align the style of the synthesized image with the desired style prompts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ID-semantics Decoupling Paradigm.To faithfully capture high-fidelity identity, we implement a novel identity-enhanced strategy during the training stage, as depicted in Fig. 2. Diverging from conventional methods [5, 16, 36] that utilize text-image pairs for training, we opt to exclude the text prompt input and deactivate cross-attention modules for text embeddings within the U-Net model. Instead, we establish a training pair consisting of an ID image, where the face is aligned to extract identity information, and denoising image (\\(x_{t}\\) in Fig. 2). Both the denoising image used for training and the ID image belong to the same individual, but they vary in factors such as viewpoints and facial expressions. This approach fosters a more comprehensive learning process [16]. We adopt Face embeddings extractor to accurately capture and leverage identity information from the input ID image. Additionally, to seamlessly integrate identity information into the denoising U-Net model, we introduce an extra trainable cross-attention mechanism (\\(K^{\\prime}_{id}\\) and \\(V^{\\prime}_{id}\\) in Fig. 2) for image embeddings.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Throughout the training phase, we exclusively optimize the parameters associated with the face mapper, CLIP mapper, and the image cross-attentionmodule, while keeping the parameters of the pre-trained diffusion model fixed. The optimization loss closely resembles the original diffusion loss formulation (as delineated in Eq. 1), with the sole distinction being the shift from a text condition to an identity condition as the conditional input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[L_{\\text{diffusion}}=E_{z_{t},t,c_{id},e\\in N(0,I)}[||\\epsilon-\\epsilon_{\\theta }(z_{t},t,c_{id})||_{2}^{2}], \\tag{3}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where the \\(c_{id}\\) is the identity embeddings of the input ID image.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'During the inference phase, we align the desired face within the ID image to afford identity information. Following the approach adopted during the training phase, we utilize a face recognition backbone and a CLIP image encoder to extract identity features from the aligned face image. Leveraging the trained face mapper, clip mapper, and image cross-attention mechanisms, these identity features are seamlessly integrated into the denoising U-Net model. Subsequently, we compute the key and value features for self-attention in the original stable diffusion model, considering only the text prompt input. These text key and value features are instrumental in the mixed attention process (illustrated in Fig. 3), facilitating the fusion of text and identity information. Moreover, to further augment the text information during the denoising process, we incorporate the original text cross-attention mechanism, integrating the resulting text hidden states with the output image hidden states obtained from the image cross-attention module.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Face Embeddings Extractor.** We adopt a multifaceted approach by incorporating pre-trained models to extract facial features. Firstly, following the method\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 3: **Mixed attention mechanism**. On the left side, we employ mixed attention to fuse identity and text information. This involves concatenating their respective key and value features and subsequently applying mixed attention, where identity features are updated based on the concatenated key and value features. On the right side, for style merging, we introduce an additional AdaIN-mean operation (as depicted in Eq. 8) to the concatenated key and value features.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ologies of prior research, we utilize a pre-trained CLIP image encoder as one of our facial feature extractors. Specifically, we leverage the local embeddings, comprising the last hidden states obtained from the CLIP image encoder, forming a sequence of embeddings with a length of N (N=257 in our implementation). Subsequently, we employ a CLIP mapper to project these image embeddings (with a dimensionality of 1664) to the same dimension as the text features in the pre-trained diffusion model. As elucidated in [36], the features extracted by the CLIP image encoder are instrumental in capturing the structural information pertinent to the identity face within identity-preserved personalization tasks. Additionally, we leverage the backbone of a face recognition model as another facial feature extractor. As highlighted in [36], features extracted by the face recognition backbone are adept at capturing the characteristics associated with human facial features within identity-preserved personalization tasks. More specifically, we utilize the global image embedding derived from the extracted features and subsequently employ a face mapper to align the dimensionality (512 dimensions) of the extracted global image embedding with the dimensionality of the text features in the pre-trained diffusion model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In summary, the identity embeddings \\(c_{id}\\) corresponding to the ID image \\(x\\) can be expressed as:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[c_{id}=\\text{Concat}\\bigg{(}\\text{M}_{\\text{clip}}\\big{(}\\text{E}_{\\text{clip} }(\\text{FA}(x))\\big{)},\\text{M}_{\\text{face}}\\big{(}\\text{E}_{\\text{face}}( \\text{FA}(x))\\big{)}\\bigg{)}, \\tag{4}\\]\n' +

      '\n' +
      '**Mixed Attention Mechanism.** As explored in previous studies [4, 13, 33], the features in the self attention layers play a crucial role in consistency image generation (across-frame in text-to-video works), which indicates these features provide a refined and detailed semantics information. In our study, we extract features from the self-attention layers of the original text-to-image diffusion model to capture rich semantic information, represented as \\(K_{t}\\) and \\(V_{t}\\). We enhance the self-attention mechanism by incorporating it into a mixed attention framework, depicted in Fig. 3 (a). This fusion enables the integration of semantic features (\\(K_{t}\\) and \\(V_{t}\\)) with the identity-based features (\\(K_{id}\\) and \\(V_{id}\\)), thereby encapsulating identity information. Through this integration, the mixed attention mechanism seamlessly merges semantic details into the generated features across different resolutions. The formulation of the mixed attention mechanism is as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\begin{split}&\\text{Attn}_{\\text{mix}}(Q,K,V)\\triangleq\\text{ Attn}(Q,\\hat{K},\\hat{V})\\\\ \\text{w.r.t}&\\hat{K}=\\text{Concat}(K_{id},K_{t}), \\quad\\hat{V}=\\text{Concat}(V_{id},V_{t}),\\\\ & K_{id}=W_{k}^{id}Z_{id},\\quad K_{t}=W_{k}^{t}Z_{t},\\\\ & V_{id}=W_{v}^{t}Z_{id},\\quad V_{t}=W_{v}^{t}Z_{t},\\end{split} \\tag{5}\\]where \\(Z_{id}\\) and \\(Z_{t}\\) are the corresponding spatial features of generated features and semantic features, respectively. The parameters \\(W_{k}^{id}\\), \\(W_{k}^{t}\\), \\(W_{v}^{id}\\), and \\(W_{v}^{t}\\) correspond to the weights of the corresponding fully connected layers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Cross-attention Merging.** To further refine semantic control, we incorporate text features into the identity feature within the cross-attention layers using the following formulation:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{Attn}_{\\text{cross}}(Q,K,V)\\triangleq\\text{Attn}(Q,K_{id}^{\\prime},V_{ id}^{\\prime})+\\text{Attn}(Q,K_{t}^{\\prime},V_{t}^{\\prime}), \\tag{6}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(K_{id}^{\\prime}=\\hat{W}_{k}^{id}c_{id}\\), \\(V_{id}^{\\prime}=\\hat{W}_{v}^{id}c_{id}\\), \\(K_{t}^{\\prime}=\\hat{W}_{k}^{t}c_{t}\\), and \\(V_{t}^{\\prime}=\\hat{W}_{v}^{t}c_{t}\\). \\(c_{id}\\) and \\(c_{t}\\) are the identity embedding and text embedding, respectively. \\(\\hat{W}_{k}^{id}\\), \\(\\hat{W}_{v}^{id}\\), \\(\\hat{W}_{k}^{t}\\), and \\(\\hat{W}_{v}^{t}\\) correspond to the weights of the trainable fully connected layers within cross-attention module.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Style Information Merging.** Inspired by [9], we propose an adaptive mean normalization (AdaIN-mean) operation to further align the style of the synthesis image with the style prompts. Concretely, we align the key and value features projected from identity features in both mixed attention and cross-attention with the key and value features projected from text features, formulated as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\begin{split} K_{id}&=\\text{AdaIN-m}(K_{id},K_{t}), \\quad V_{id}=\\text{AdaIN-m}(V_{id},V_{t}),\\quad\\text{For Mixed Attention}\\\\ K_{id}^{\\prime}&=\\text{AdaIN-m}(K_{id}^{\\prime},K_{t} ^{\\prime}),\\quad V_{id}^{\\prime}=\\text{AdaIN-m}(V_{id}^{\\prime},V_{t}^{\\prime}),\\quad\\text{For Cross Attention}\\end{split} \\tag{7}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where the AdaIN-mean operation (AdaIN-m(\\(\\cdot\\))) is defined as:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{AdaIN-m}(x,y)=x-\\mu(x)+\\mu(y), \\tag{8}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +

      '**Implementation Details.** Our experiments leverage a pre-trained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model [20]. For image encoding, we utilize the OpenCLIP ViT-H/14 [37] and the backbone of ArcFace [10]. The SDXL model consists of 70 cross-attention layers, to each of which we append an additional image cross-attention module. Training is conducted on 16 A100 GPUs for 1 million steps,with a batch size of 4 per GPU. We employ the AdamW optimizer with a fixed learning rate of 1e-4 and weight decay set to 0.01. During inference, we employ the DDIM Sampler with 30 steps and guidance scale is set to 5.0. Training data are sourced from multiple datasets, including the LAION-2B dataset [30], the LAION-Face dataset [41], and images collected from the internet. We curate a dataset where each individual is represented by multiple photographs.\n' +

      '**Evaluation.** We assess the efficacy of our approach in preserving both identity fidelity and semantic consistency. Specifically, we measure identity fidelity, utilizing metrics such as \\(M_{\\text{FaceNet}}\\) (measured by FaceNet [28]) and CLIP-I [7]. Identity fidelity is evaluated based on the similarity of detected faces between the reference image and generated images. Semantic consistency is quantified using CLIP text-image consistency (CLIP-T [21]), which compares the text prompt with the corresponding generated images. More definition of metrics are detailed in Sec. A.1 of the supplementary materials.\n' +

FastComposer [35] exhibits challenges in maintaining identity fidelity, often presenting undesired artifacts in synthesized images. While IP-Adapter [36] and IP-Adapter-Face [36] demonstrates relatively fewer artifacts, its semantic consistency fall short. This phenomenon arises from the direct fusion of identity information with semantic details within the U-net model, leading to a compromise in semantic consistency. In contrast, PhotoMaker [16] exhibits commendable semantic consistency but falls short in preserving identity fidelity.

      'In this paper, we introduce Infinite-ID, an innovative identity-preserved personalization method designed to meet the requirement of identity (ID) fidelity and semantic consistency of the text prompt, all achievable with just one reference image and completed within seconds. Infinite-ID comprises three key components: the identity-enhanced training, mixed attention mechanism, and adaptive mean normalization (AdaIN-mean). Through extensive experimentation, our results illustrate that Infinite-ID outperforms baseline methods, delivering strong ID fidelity, superior generation quality, and precise semantic consistency in both raw photo generation and style image generation tasks. However, it\'s important to note that our method lacks multi-object personalization capability. Moreover, artifacts may occur when the human face occupies only a small portion of the entire image, attributed to limitations inherent in the original diffusion model.\n' +
