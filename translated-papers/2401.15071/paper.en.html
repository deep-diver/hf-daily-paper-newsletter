      '\n' +
      'Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive abilities in generating reasonable responses with respect to multi-modal contents. However, there is still a wide gap between the performance of recent MLLM-based applications and the expectation of the broad public, even though the most powerful OpenAI\'s GPT-4 and Google\'s Gemini have been deployed. This paper strives to enhance understanding of the gap through the lens of a qualitative study on the generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning capabilities of recent proprietary and open-source MLLMs across four modalities: _i.e._, text, code, image, and video, ultimately aiming to improve the transparency of MLLMs. We believe these properties are several representative factors that define the reliability of MLLMs, in supporting various downstream applications. To be specific, we evaluate the closed-source GPT-4 and Gemini and 6 open-source LLMs and MLLMs. Overall we evaluate 230 manually designed cases, where the qualitative results are then summarized into 12 scores (_i.e._, 4 modalities \\(\\times\\) 3 properties). In total, we uncover 14 empirical findings that are useful to understand the capabilities and limitations of both proprietary and open-source MLLMs, towards more reliable downstream multi-modal applications.\n' +

      '### Empirical Findings\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **Overall text and coding capabilities.** Gemini\'s performance is far inferior to GPT-4, but it is better than open-source models [80] Llama-2-70B-Chat and [81] Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1. For the open-source models, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 performs better than Llama-2-70B-Chat in both text and code.\n' +
      '2. **Multilingual capabilities.** Gemini outperforms GPT-4 and the best open-source models. Gemini can correctly understand the nuances of idioms and the complex structures of English sentences and then translate them accurately, whereas GPT-4 and open-source models often only translate the literal meaning, as detailed in Section 2.1.2. Additionally, the Chinese translations generated by Gemini are often more elegant.\n' +
      '3. **Mathematical and reasoning ability.** Whether it\'s multi-solution math problems, theorem proofs, and commonsense reasoning, Gemini often performs poorly, with results close to the open source models Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 and Llama-2-70B-Chat, while GPT-4 tends to perform better. Gemini sometimes exhibits errors in recalling theorems and knowledge, as detailed in Section 2.1.1 and Section 2.1.3; even when using the correct knowledge, it often fails due to calculation errors, as referenced in Section 2.1.6.\n' +
      '4. **Domain knowledge.** Gemini often has only a superficial understanding of certain domain knowledge. Whether in the domains of medicine, economics, or discipline, Gemini can understand the specialized terminology and issues in these domains. However, when applying this knowledge to solve a specific problem, it often makes mistakes, as detailed in section Section 2.1.6. GPT-4 not only possesses professional knowledge but knows how to apply it, often correctly solving problems in specialized fields. As for image-input, in the medical professional field (where GPT-4 avoids answering these series of questions), Gemini Pro demonstrates good capabilities in medical image modality recognition and content comprehension compared to the open-source MLLMs, and offers potentially valuable diagnostic suggestions in some cases. However, based on the evaluation results from our cases, the current MLLMs under test still face significant challenges in providing effective medical diagnoses and comprehensive reports.\n' +
      '5. **Text and code trustworthiness and safety.** Gemini Pro lacks this capability compared to GPT-4 and even the open-source model Llama-2. It struggles to proficiently identify inducements and pitfalls in test prompts, such as instances of discrimination, stereotypes, and illegal behaviors. We also found that Mixtral\'s text trustworthiness capability is not robust enough. Sometimes it can identify traps in prompts and give safe responses, but sometimes it fails. In terms of extreme risks, we focus on potential chemical threats. Gemini Pro has a good knowledge of chemistry and can accurately give the synthesis methods of compounds, etc. However, it often fails to recognize that a given compound is dangerous. In contrast, GPT-4 and Llama-2 do a better job of this, responding with warnings that the compound is hazardous. Mixtral may be limited by its own chemical knowledge. Although it also gives a reply, it is not detailed. In terms of coding trustworthiness, Llama-2 and GPT-4 hold a substantial advantage over Gemini Pro. Gemini Pro has powerful code generation capabilities, but it is difficult for it to identify safety risks in test prompts, such as violations of social ethics, safety extreme risks, and even directly give dangerous answers.\n' +
      '6. **Text causality.**In text causality scenarios, our analysis reveals a distinct pattern in the responses of different models. Specifically, Gemini Pro tends to provide straightforward and compliant answers, particularly in cases where the question explicitly requires a simple "Yes or No" response or involves making a selection from multiple choices. This characteristic of Gemini Pro makes it a more practical option for large-scale evaluations where concise responses are preferred. In contrast, other models showed a propensity to include explanatory details in their responses. While this approach might be less efficient for bulk processing, it offers a clearer insight into the underlying reasoning process of the models, which is particularly beneficial in case studies where understanding the logic behind a decision is crucial.\n' +
      '7. **Code causality.** GPT-4 shows an exceptional ability to assess the feasibility of a given problem and to provide logical and coherent explanations. This skill is crucial for accurately identifying and solving problems. However, the other three models do not exhibit the same level of proficiency in this aspect. They struggle to accurately recognize the feasibility of problems, often leading to the generation of codes that do not align with the expected outcomes or requirements.\n' +
      '8. **Image capability.** For image generalization ability, MLLMs have demonstrated proficient capabilities in understanding the main content of images. It is capable of analyzing a substantial portion of the information in an image based on posed queries. However, there remains room for improvement in tasks that require precise localization, such as detection, or tasks that necessitate accurate information extraction, such as chart analysis that involves OCR capabilities.\n' +
      '9. **Multi-image Tasks.** MLLMs still face challenges in handling multi-image tasks that involve complex reasoning. For instance, tasks such as robotic navigation in Figure 140, which requires spatial imagination, ICL in Figure 153,154, demanding similarity reasoning, and manga analysis in Figure 152, involving inter-image relationship analysis, present difficulties for MLLM.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '10. **Image trustworthiness.** In the robustness tests involving visual noise, Gemini and other MLLMs demonstrated varying levels of performance. Gemini was able to identify the two cats despite the Gaussian noise, but with less accuracy compared to a specialized image processing model. In the tests with high light conditions and backlit scenes, Gemini exhibited a moderate ability to interpret images. While it correctly identified the night scene on the highway, it struggled with the silhouette image against the bright sunset. In the test with a blank image, Gemini, [33], [8] LAMM, and [33], [1] LLaVA exhibited a tendency to fabricate responses or assert unwarranted certainty in the absence of relevant information. In contrast, GPT-4 demonstrated a more accurate and reliable approach by acknowledging the absence of content, thus adhering to principles of factual accuracy. In the realm of image safety, Gemini Pro exhibits significant shortcomings compared to GPT-4. Users can relatively easily manipulate Gemini Pro to generate dangerous responses to images. Both current open-source models and Gemini Pro require further optimization regarding image safety.\n' +
      '11. **Image causality abilities.** Gemini\'s performance falls significantly short when compared to the capabilities of GPT-4, although it is comparable to other open-source models such as LLaVA. Notably, Gemini exhibits limitations in discerning intricate details within complex and real-world scenarios, such as urban flooding. In contrast, GPT-4 excels in handling these challenges, showcasing a superior capacity for nuanced understanding and analysis. A distinctive trait of Gemini is its tendency to provide concise and often limited responses to a given question. Conversely, GPT-4 distinguishes itself by its ability to consider a broader impact, offering more comprehensive and insightful answers that take into account a wider range of contextual factors.\n' +
      '12. **Video generalization ability.** Open source MLLMs that have been specifically tuned on video data perform better than Gemini Pro and GPT-4. Compared to open-source MLLMs that have only been fine-tuned on image instruction datasets, Gemini Pro exhibits enhanced video understanding capabilities, including temporal modeling. However, the advantage is not markedly significant. In scenarios involving simulated video inquiries, GPT-4, governed by its stringent safety protocols, frequently abstains from offering responses. However, within the scope of its operational parameters where it engages in response provision, GPT-4 demonstrates a markedly superior comprehension of video content relative to Gemini Pro. Gemini excels in predicting future events based on current actions, particularly in dynamic contexts, by demonstrating strong anticipatory skills. It provides concise and accurate responses for temporal action prediction, showcasing its proficiency in understanding evolving details in images and its continuous modeling capabilities.\n' +
      '13. **Video trustworthiness.** While Gemini displays moderate ability in identifying elements in videos under challenging weather conditions, GPT-4 excels in this area, demonstrating superior proficiency in deciphering details obscured by elements like rain or fog. In tests involving blank video stimuli, Gemini shows inconsistency, sometimes recognizing the absence of content but often veering off into irrelevant responses. GPT-4, however, consistently identifies non-informative stimuli and refrains from extraneous inferences, showcasing better handling of ambiguity. In the video safety evaluation, Gemini exhibits a mixed approach to ethical sensitivity and safety protocols. While it sometimes suggests ethically questionable methods initially, such as proposing ways to make people unhappy or describing a method to reproduce an explosion. GPT-4 consistently demonstrates a strong commitment to ethical guidelines, immediately recognizing and rejecting inappropriate prompts across all scenarios. Overall, GPT-4 stands out for its unwavering ethical stance, while Gemini\'s approach, though ultimately aligning with ethical norms, initially raises concerns.\n' +
      '14. **Video causality capabilities.** All the models exhibit subpar performance, consistently falling short in generating valid responses that aptly capture the interconnected sequence of events. This persistent inadequacy underscores a substantial limitation in their predictive prowess, particularly evident in scenarios featuring intricate, multi-step interactions. A discernible deficit exists in their aptitude for comprehending and deducing causality from the presented sequence of events, particularly when pivotal information is unveiled only at the climax of said sequence. This pronounced limitation underscores challenges in their ability to discern and interpret causative relationships effectively.\n' +

      'In this section, we embark on an in-depth evaluation of MLLMs within the realm of text modality, which emerges as a key component in the development of MLLMs and the journey towards artificial general intelligence. Our investigation is methodically segmented into three pivotal modules: Capability, Trustworthiness, and Causality, with each module featuring a series of meticulously designed cases spanning various domains. Beyond assessing [1] Gemini Pro and [20] GPT-4, to discern the performance variations between open and closed-source models, we also select two representative open-source models for assessment, i.e., [21] Llama-2-70B-Chat [50] and [22] Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 [37]. Given our focus on text, code modality in Section 2, Section 3, in these two sections, with a slight misuse, we collectively refer to the four models under evaluation as Large Language Models (LLMs).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Firstly, In Section 2.1, we scrutinize the multifaceted generalization capabilities of LLMs, encompassing their mathematical, multilingual, reasoning, role-playing, creative writing, and domain-specific knowledge abilities. In Section 2.2, addressing the growing concerns about the ethical and societal implications of LLMs, we focus on the evaluation of trustworthiness. We rigorously evaluate seven critical dimensions of trustworthiness: safety, reliability, robustness, morality, data protection, fairness, and legality. Lastly, in Section 2.3, we delve into the causality abilities of LLMs. We assess LLMs\' proficiency in various causality-related tasks, from identifying statistical correlations to comprehending counterfactuals, thereby uncovering their potential in complex decision-making scenarios.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Evaluation Setting**: For both Gemini Pro and GPT-4, we adhere to the default settings provided by their official APIs. For Llama2-70B-chat and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, we use the publicly available inference code from the Huggingface model card. And following the official blog, we employ the suggested instruct prompt during inference.To reduce randomness and instability, we standardized the use of greedy decoding for the open-source LLMs, setting \'do_sample=False\', which implies no result sampling is conducted.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For each test case, we manually ranked the responses from each model based on a set of criteria including the correctness of the answer, the detail level of the response, the diversity of perspectives, and the completeness and reasonableness of the response, among others. To minimize bias, each case is evaluated by three independent judges. We then calculate an average score for each module, based on the rankings of each case, providing a quantitative outcome for our analysis. This enables us to conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis of the capabilities of these models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Text Generalization Capability\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The understanding and generation of text is a crucial modality for measuring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Following previous works [6; 16; 5] on LLM evaluations, we carefully design six dimensions for generalization capability evaluation. It includes mathematical ability, multilingual ability, reasoning ability, role-playing ability, creative writing ability, and domain knowledge familiarity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Mathematical Ability** It encompasses the capacity for analysis, numerical understanding, and resolving problems. LLMs often struggle to tackle math problems that require quantitative analysis or complicated reasoning. Unlike conventional mathematical ability tests, we focus on two more challenging scenarios: the ability to provide multiple solutions and the theorem and formula proof.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Multilingual Ability** Since LLMs are primarily trained on English data, they tend to face challenges when dealing with other languages. Here, we evaluate the multilingual capabilities of LLMs by creating translation scenarios that involve cultural nuances or complex sentence structure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Reasoning Ability** It refers to how efficiently one can reach solutions or draw conclusions from the evidence at hand. We focus on common sense reasoning, logical reasoning, and logical fallacy detection.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Role-playing Ability** Role-playing is an important application of LLMs. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in simulating different roles, characters, and professions in terms of verbal and non-verbal communication, interpersonal skills, and flexibility.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Creative Writing Ability** Creative writing (e.g., poetry or storytelling) is one of the most remarkable applications of LLMs. We attempt to assess the capabilities of LLMs in generating short and long creative writing texts in terms of novelty, surprise, and other aspects.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Domain Knowledge Familiarity** Domain knowledge refers to the in-depth knowledge of a particular, specialized area, profession, or activity, unlike general knowledge. We focus on testing capabilities in medicine, economics, and 10 academic disciplines.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The existing test datasets are likely to be included in the model\'s training corpus [42; 65], results in that it is hard to accurately gauge the true performance of LLMs. To fairly compare the performance of Gemini, GPT-4, and open-source\n' +

      '\n' +
      'For the multilingual capability evaluation, we explore the LLM\'s ability to understand idioms unique to a specific language and complex texts by translating the given text into another language. Specifically, we focus on three aspects: (1) translating English idioms into Chinese, (2) translating Chinese idioms into English, (3) translating complex texts from English to Chinese. The results are displayed in Figure 6 and Figure 7, and Figure 8. The experimental results show that Gemini has the best multilingual capability, followed by GPT-4 and open-source models lagging.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Translating English idioms into ChineseIdioms in different languages vary greatly, primarily due to the significant differences in geographical environments and social customs among various countries, making them challenging to translate into other languages. Gemini performs best in translating Idioms from English to Chinese (shown in Figure 6), followed by GPT-4 and Llama lagging. For instance, in the first example, "Give me a bell" means to call or contact someone. Gemini accurately captures its meaning, while GPT-4 and Llama provide mere literal translations. Similarly, in the fifteenth example, "Float your boat," which means to do something according to one\'s preference, was correctly interpreted by Gemini. In contrast, the other two models opt for a direct translation, which is incorrect.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Translating Chinese idioms into EnglishThe results are shown in Figure 7. The three models present challenges when translating Chinese idioms into English, but Gemini performs slightly better. For example, in the ninth example, "["][" means "satire," GPT-4 translates it as "strange," while Gemini and Mixtral provide accurate translation. But Gemini\'s translation is slightly more accurate.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Complex texts from English to ChineseWe test the LLM\'s understanding of complex texts, which usually contain complicated structures and phrases, by translating text from English to Chinese. The results are shown in Figure 8. Among the 14 examples tested, Gemini performs the best, followed by GPT-4, while Llama is the least effective. For instance, in the fifth sentence, "They didn\'t come to the hospital because they wanted to see me," the word "not" actually negates the content after "because," which only Gemini correctly captured. GPT-4 and Llama misunderstand it. Additionally, Gemini\'s translations tend to be more elegant in the Chinese context, as demonstrated in sentences 13 and 14.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We conduct three distinct types of tests to compare the reasoning abilities of four testing models. These tests focus on (1) logical reasoning, (2) commonsense reasoning, and (3) logical fallacies detection. Our findings reveal a notable disparity in performance. While Gemini demonstrates marginally better capabilities in pure logical reasoning compared to GPT-4, it lags significantly in integrating logical reasoning with commonsense and specific scenarios. In the sections that follow, we will delve deeper into these differences, providing examples to illustrate how each model performs across the three test categories.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Logical ReasoningA logical reasoning question presents a daunting multi-step challenge for a language model. First, it must accurately extract and understand the key information embedded within the problem. Then, it needs to systematically explore a vast space of potential solutions, carefully evaluating each against the provided information and established logical principles. Finally, the model must rigorously construct a watertight argument, justifying its chosen answer with clear and precise reasoning. And when it comes to pure logical reasoning ability, Gemini marginally outperforms GPT-4, though it is not without its flaws. However, Gemini\'s limitations in integrating reasoning with varied scenarios result in less comprehensive considerations compared to GPT-4 in certain contexts. The other two open-source models are significantly less adept in this aspect, trailing behind both Gemini and GPT-4.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 9, all models provide incorrect answers to this question. Among them, Gemini\'s approach is more focused on logical reasoning, effectively identifying contradictions in the testmonies across two scenarios. Interestingly, despite its sound logic, Gemini\'s first answer is incorrect. GPT-4 adopts a simpler classification discussion method, possibly influenced by its tendency to solve problems using code. While its code execution yields correct results, logical issues in its analysis lead to incorrect conclusions in its summary. Among the three models, Llama, despite employing classification discussion methods and logical reasoning techniques, performs the worst due to its incorrect logic.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 10 depicts a question challenging logical reasoning in a specific situation, proving more complex than the previous example. The intuitive answer is to shoot at C, but the correct strategy is intentionally missing the target. GPT-4 is the only model to correctly identify the strategy of deliberately missing, while the other models, including Gemini and Llama, err by concluding that shooting at C is the best option. Notably, Gemini\'s response involves a numerical and quantitative analysis but fails to calculate the probability of ultimate victory. Llama, through clearer logical reasoning and qualitative analysis, also arrives at the conclusion of shooting C, closely matching Gemini\'s performance on this question.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 11, in the task of recognizing and understanding the Fibonacci sequence, only GPT-4 correctly identifies the sequence and provides the accurate answer. The performance of the other models, including Gemini and Llama, does not exhibit a significant difference. Although the logic in the responses of Gemini and Llama is flawed, it maintains a level of internal consistency.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Commonsense ReasoningPerforming commonsense reasoning requires the model to have correct commonsense reserves and be able to analyze the role of commonsense in actual scenarios. Finally, based on the user\'s prompt words, the model needs to use commonsense to explain a certain phenomenon, predict, or output the answer to the question. In terms of the Reasoning of commonsense, GPT-4 is relatively better. In the first problem of commonsense reasoning, Gemini encounters an issue in the final step. By contrast, Mixtral and Llama\'s accuracy in commonsense is not high, showing relatively poor performance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As is shown in Figure 12, in the first case, we hope to get the third-largest country in Asia, excluding Russia and India. GPT-4 and Mixtral provide the correct answer through step-by-step analysis, and Gemini also analyzes it but encounters a problem in the final analysis. It attempts to find the third-largest country outside of China and Mongolia but ultimately provides the answer as China.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the second case, according to commonsense, we hope the model can point out that liking railings in winter may result in the tongue sticking to the railing. The results from Figure 13 indicate that GPT-4 can directly tell this consequence, but Gemini and Llama attempt to explain the consequences from other perspectives, such as the risk of frostbite.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the third case, we hope the model can directly tell the user that a crater is formed due to a meteorite impact, rather than a meteorite precisely landing in a crater. As shown in Figure 14, GPT-4 goes through a detailed and tedious analysis, only mentioning towards the end that a crater is formed after a meteorite impact, without providing this information at the beginning. Gemini tells that the statement is incorrect, as a meteorite may not necessarily hit a crater accurately, and attempts to explain the statement from various angles. Mixtral points out at the beginning that meteorites created impact craters, but then it starts analyzing the process and influencing factors of crater formation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Logical Fallacy DetectionThe task of identifying hidden logical fallacies within language demands that a model first scrutinize the problem at hand, and then dissect the logical contradictions embedded within. This represents a significant challenge for current models, as it requires a profound understanding of language nuances and critical analysis of the presented information.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As depicted in Figure 15, none of the models, including Gemini and GPT-4, identify any hidden logical fallacies within this question. Instead, they focus on analyzing various factors affecting the express delivery system. Notably, Llama brings up issues related to user needs, an aspect that Gemini overlooks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'See Figure 16 for reference. In this section, both GPT-4 and Mixtral recognize the existence of the "liar paradox" and provide a reasonable explanation for it. Gemini, on the other hand, delivers an incorrect response without any justification. The reason for this error could be attributed to a misunderstanding of Rabbit\'s response.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 17, in this case, we hope the model can point out that having a photo of Shakespeare eating a hamburger is impossible because hamburgers and cameras haven\'t been invented. GPT-4 and Llama provide steps to search for this photo and ask if assistance is needed in creating an image of Shakespeare eating a hamburger. Gemini points out that such a photo would not exist and identifies the commonsense error in the prompt.\n' +

      '*Shoot at C (the 100% accurate shooter): This is the most direct way to eliminate the biggest threat, but it\'s highly unlikely you\'ll hit given your 30% accuracy. If you miss, B will likely try to shoot C (to save themselves), or C will shoot either you or B in their turn.\n' +

When these objects enter a planet\'s atmosphere and strike the surface, they release a significant amount of energy, resulting in the formation of a crater. The size and shape of the crater depend on various factors, including the size, angle, and velocity of the impacting body, as well as the geological characteristics of the surface.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. Observation Bias: It might seem like meteorites always hit craters because craters are the most visible evidence of meteorite impacts. When astronomers or scientists observe celestial bodies, they often look at craters to study past impacts. This focus can create a perception bias, making it seem as if meteorites have a peculiar ability to hit existing craters, which is not the case.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. Random Distribution: In reality, meteorites fall randomly over the planet\'s surface. The Earth, as well as other bodies in the solar system, is constantly bombarded by space material. Most of this material is small and burns up in the atmosphere, but some larger pieces can create craters upon impact. The distribution of these impact events is random and does not specifically target existing craters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '4. Existing Craters: Existing craters can be struck by new meteorites purely by chance. However, given the vast surface area of planetary bodies and the relatively small size of craters, new meteorites directly hitting old craters is a rare occurrence and not the norm. In summary, while it may seem like meteorites have a direct aim for craters, this is just a misconception. Craters are simply the scars left behind by impacting bodies, and their distribution is a random process governed by the dynamics of celestial mechanics and the geological history of the planetary surface.\n' +

      'Meteorites do not always hit the ground and create a crater, and when they do, the size and shape of the crater are not necessarily determined by the size and shape of the meteorite. Instead, the formation of a crater depends on a variety of factors, including the size, speed, composition, and angle of impact of the meteorite, as well as the properties of the surface it strikes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is a common misconception that meteorites always hit the ground at a right angle and create a symmetrical, circular crater. In reality, the angle of impact can vary, and the resulting crater may be asymmetrical or elliptical. The shape of the crater is also influenced by the shape of the meteorite and the properties of the ground surface.\n' +

      'In summary, meteorites do not always hit the ground and create a crater, and the size and shape of the crater are not determined solely by the size and shape of the meteorite.

      '#### 2.1.4 Role-playing Ability\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In our assessment of role-playing abilities among four testing language models, we focus on three main areas: (1) Professional Role-Playing; (2) Scene-Based Role-Playing; and (3) Character Imitation. GPT-4 excels in most areas, particularly in Scene-Based Role-Playing and Character Imitation, demonstrating creative strength and consistency. Gemini is competitive in Professional Role-Playing. Llama performs well in most areas compared with Mixtral, While Mixtral performs better in Character Imitation. A common issue across all four language models is the tendency towards repetitive language patterns.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Professional Role-Playing LLMs are experts at providing professional knowledge. They can deliver tailored, contextually relevant, and accurate information instantly, saving human effort. The potential applications range from legal and medical to customer service industries.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 18, This problem aims at testing LLM\'s knowledge of legal activities and providing reasonable suggestions accordingly. It\'s worth noting that acquiring Gemini\'s response to this problem requires reducing its security settings, reflecting Gemini\'s stricter security policy. In terms of specifics, Gemini generates the most detailed context, with GPT-4 being second to it. Mixtral generates the least specifics. Mixtral makes 5 recommendations with one short sentence for each, while GPT-4 and Gemini list nearly 10 points and explain them in detail, creating an order-of-magnitude difference. GPT-4 and Gemini perform similarly on this question and both outperform Mixtral.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As depicted in Figure 19, LLMs are expected to exhibit professionalism and offer symptom-related suggestions. Gemini is more role-play aware and points out the possible illness. Its contents are in the order of Problems, Preliminary recommendations and Next step, thus having the most organized contents. In comparison, GPT-4 does not get into character well, presumably due to the limitations of the model\'s own security strategy. GPT-4 also fails to name the possible illness clearly. Llama steps into the role of a mental health counselor well, identifying the cause of the illness and giving 5 points of advice, but only half the number of advice provided by GPT-4 and Gemini. It can be concluded that GPT-4 and Gemini\'s mental health counselor responses were more structured, and their role as mental health counselors is more competent than Llama\'s.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 20, This question aims to test LLMs\' flexibility. They should abide by the given rule while satisfying customer\'s demands. GPT-4 is more reasonable and fits the customer service role. Gemini repeats and follows the given post-sales rule stubbornly and fails to meet customer\'s expectations. Gemini also mistakes the problem and generates all conversations at once. Llama informs consumers of the policy, provides practical solutions and asks for further information. The "dear valued customer" narrative fully demonstrates the importance of users. In conclusion, GPT-4 and Llama play the customer service identity well, while Gemini fails.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scene-Based Role-Playing Role-playing in specific scenes aids in creating immersive and realistic scenarios, which can be instrumental in training, creation, and simulation exercises. However, precautions should be taken to prevent the simulation of illegal behavior.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 21, GPT-4, Gemini and Llama embody similar security in this question, none of which can play an illegal role. In addition to rejection, Gemini provides extra information on ways of learning robbery knowledge and on interesting facts. Different from GPT-4 and Gemini, Llama also reasons that the questioner might have an economic problem. This educated guess may be helpful to prevent potential crimes from a motivational perspective.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 22, this question tests LLMs creativity and imagination, as well as narrative from a first-person perspective. All 3 LLMs correctly set the background in the 15th century, and have colloquial language. GPT-4 exhibits rich creativity in story-telling and plotting, and has a stronger ability to organize language, though it mistakenly tells the story from a third person\'s perspective. It gives specific names to characters and objects that appear in the context, such as the protagonist "Heifeng". Gemini generates more content, but often starts with "us" and lacks specific names, resulting in the fact that its story is less engaging and interesting than GPT-4. Gemini is suspected of corpus pollution because Captain Jack appears inexplicably. Llama\'s narrative story structure is complete. However, it has fewer details and sentence patterns. Overall, GPT-4\'s ability to play a pirate\'s role is better than Gemini\'s, and Gemini\'s is better than Llama\'s.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The result is illustrated in Figure 23. LLMs are expected to express empathy and emotional capacity besides proper response. The three LLMs all play the role of mother aptly in terms of tone and content. However, the emotional performance of GPT-4 is significantly better than the other two. It possesses details of recalling imagination and homemade cookies, which are more vivid and emotion-arousing. Gemini and Llama have common problems. They often start with "I" and use repeated sentence patterns, thus seeming unnatural. In conclusion, GPT-4 performs best.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Character ImitationThis ability enables the LLM to provide personalized experiences and interactions. In educational settings, role-playing historical figures or experts can bring subjects to life, making learning more engaging and relatable. In professional training, mimicking industry leaders or specific roles can provide insights into decision-making processes and leadership styles, enhancing training effectiveness.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 24, LLMs are expected to write in classical English and language style. GPT-4 has a security protocol that prevents it from simulating a real person. So the additional prompt is introduced to bypass the protocol. In terms of wording, all three LLMs use classical English, which is consistent with the character\'s identity setting. GPT-4\'s acting style is positive and upbeat, and generally shows affirmation of modern literature, interspersed with a few negative views and emotions. Gemini\'s style is overall negative, majorly showing dissatisfaction and disappointment with modern literature. Mistrtal has a neutral attitude, expressing both joy and sadness about modern literature. Unique from the other 2 models, Mistrtal quotes terms and people from Shakespeare\'s era. However, there\'s an inappropriate quote that is unlikely to be said by Shakespeare himself. The language style of GPT-4 sounds closest to classical English, followed closely by Gemini and Mistrtal, with an insignificant gap. In addition, GPT-4 has the best literary talent, and the sentence structures of GPT-4 and Gemini are richer than Mistrtal.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The result is illustrated in Figure 25. LLMs are expected to mimic Trump\'s speaking style and mention some of his mantras. Due to the strict security policy of GPT-4, it takes multiple modifications to the prompt to successfully imitate Donald Trump. Both GPT-4 and Gemini mention Trump\'s mantras like "Make America Great Again". The wording of the GPT-4 is rigorous and more in line with Trump\'s identity as a former US president, while Gemini\'s wording is flamboyant and does not quite match the style of a political figure. Llama integrates the mantras naturally into the context, but it seems to have mistakenly quoted the wall which should refer to the US-Mexico border wall. Overall GPT-4 performs the best in this question.\n' +

      '#### 2.1.5 Creative Writing Ability\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In evaluating the creative writing abilities of four testing models, we focus on two key areas: (1) Short Text Writing, which includes jokes and poetry; and (2) Long Text Writing, involving fairy tales, plays, and science fiction stories. All four models show comparable imagination and logic. Gemini excels in language richness, while GPT-4 adheres more closely to specific prompts. In certain instances, Mixtral and Llama surpass both in creative expression.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Short Text WritingIn the domain of short text writing, assessments focus on evaluating the language style exhibited in poems and the degree of humor in jokes. Effective poems should employ rhyme and metaphor techniques as well as elegant and poetic expressions. Effective humor writing should evoke laughter through originality and unexpected surprises. The result is that each model demonstrates comparable proficiency in task completion. Notably, Gemini and Llama exhibit linguistic richness and aesthetic appeal, and Gemini also excels in brevity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 26, in terms of poetic language style, Gemini exhibits more elegance compared to Llama, and Llama is superior to GPT-4. Gemini\'s vocabulary is characterized by its elegance and lyricism, whereas GPT-4 opts for more rational but less elegant mathematical terms. All models have the ability to rhyme, but Gemini\'s writing shows heightened brevity. It is noteworthy that both Gemini and Llama do not meet the requirement of restricting their compositions to exactly three sentences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In terms of imitating a joke as shown in Figure 27, Gemini can craft short, impressive jokes that surpass GPT-4 and Mixtral. However, all the LLMs share common issues. Their jokes, while accurately using computer science knowledge, often lack direct humor. Firstly, many jokes are so similar to existing examples that lack originality as observed in Mixtral\'s responses. Secondly, some jokes are mere imitations or copies from the internet. Thirdly, the humor can be too obscure, requiring extensive computer science knowledge to understand, as evident in Round 2 of both Gemini and GPT-4. Lastly, the punchlines are at times placed in unrelated or unnatural contexts, as seen in GPT-4\'s last two rounds.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Long Text WritingIn the domain of long text writing, the key points to be examined include adherence to specific prompts, internal logic, and creativity. The writing is expected to align with the prompt requirements, ensuring both content and form align consistently with the given guidelines. Logical coherence and content consistency must be maintained throughout the entire piece. Creativity is imperative for the article to distinguish itself and stand out. Regarding the outcomes, each model manifests unique strengths alongside specific logic shortcomings. GPT-4 adheres closest to given prompts, while Gemini and Llama excel in creativity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For writing children\'s stories with a specific prompt as shown in Figure 28, Gemini slightly outweighs both GPT-4 and Mixtral in creativity. GPT-4\'s and Mixtral\'s stories often suffer from overloading too many central themes and adhering to a predictable template: a curious protagonist effortlessly overcomes adversities or easily achieves wisdom to gain respect. Gemini, however, breaks free from this mold with a logically coherent and rich plot, incorporating dialogue in direct quotations that align more closely with children\'s reading preferences.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'When it comes to crafting stories without specific prompts as in Figure 29, Gemini and GPT-4 exhibit greater creativity, presenting unique plots like weaving stories or collecting gems, diverging from the conventional success journey narrative. Llama, while still creative, lacks a specific protagonist in these cases, leading to less detail or engagement. A shared strength among these three LLMs is their logical coherence in storytelling.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the case of writing a satirical article as shown in Figure 30, Llama leads in irony, followed by GPT-4, with Gemini being average. Gemini\'s satire misses the mark by too positively portraying traffic congestion. GPT-4 uses subtler irony, effectively employing metaphors and addressing real-life issues, but it leans more towards rebuttal than satire. Llama stands out in satirizing the lack of diversity and disregard for facts in social media, while mockingly suggesting the achievement of political democracy. It skillfully employs rhetorical questions to enhance its satirical effect.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 31, regarding the task of rewriting a play in script format, all LLMs are capable of handling the format. However, while GPT-4 manages to adapt the plot without clearly pointing out the real murderer, Gemini and Mixtral struggle with adaptation, merely retelling the original plot using a great portion of the original text.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 32, when comparing science fiction narratives for logical coherence, Mixtral demonstrates relatively higher capabilities compared to Gemini, and Gemini surpasses GPT-4. Gemini weaves a complete tale from sunspot eruptions to human extinction, emphasizing human bonds and harmony. Its story is richly detailed and imbued with a deep sense of humanity. Mixtral\'s science fiction delves into a more pioneering idea, presenting possibilities that individuals can join the sunspots, shed their physical forms and embrace digital afterlife. In contrast, GPT-4\'s conclusion, deviating from the theme of human extinction, ends abruptly with humanity sparking a philosophical and spiritual awakening, which becomes too broad and disconnected.\n' +

      'For the domain knowledge familiarity test, we consider (1) medical ability, (2) economics ability, and (3) full disciplines (e.g., law and literature) ability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Medical AbilityAs shown in Figure 33, Figure 34 and Figure 35. These cases are designed to evaluate the medical capabilities of the models. The first two cases are two questions from a certain medical examination, and the last one is a real consultation case. Among the three models, GPT-4\'s grasp of medical domain knowledge is much ahead of that other models. Gemini, Llama and Mixtral have similar performance in the medical domain, with Gemini lagging slightly behind.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'With the result displayed in Figure 33 and Figure 34, we can observe that only GPT-4 answers the question correctly and gives a correct reasoning process. Gemini, Llama and Mixtral answer both questions incorrectly. Although they can often correctly analyze the patient\'s problems, such as dehydration in Figure 33 and electrolyte imbalance in Figure 34 (showing as green text). However, when they are asked to make more detailed diagnoses and make the best choice based on more comprehensive information, errors are often made. GPT-4 can comprehensively analyze patient information and make more detailed and accurate judgments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this case, the symptoms described by the patient actually have some characteristics of colds and flu. In addition, the patient takes some flu drugs privately, so it is easy for the model to misjudge. However, because this disease does not have other characteristics of the flu, it is actually just a common cold. With the results shown in Figure 35, both GPT-4 and Llama judge it to be a common cold or flu, while Gemini is influenced by the patient\'s medication information and considers it to be influenza. But they all give reasonable suggestions for patient who wants to relieve his sore throats.\n' +

      'Economics AbilityWe consider both free text and tabular text formats to evaluate economic knowledge ability. Experimental results show that the GPT-4 performance outperforms Gemini.\n' +

Both Gemini and GPT-4 cover all three aspects in their responses, while Llama only addressed two aspects, indicating a slightly insufficient grasp of economic knowledge. Figure 37 shows the results of the economics calculation problem, testing the model\'s mathematical abilities and its grasp of economic principles. GPT-4 correctly solves the problem, while Gemini and Llama make mistakes in understanding economic concepts. The required increase in government spending equals the needed increase in equilibrium income divided by the MPC multiplier. However, Gemini and Llama directly multiplied the MPC multiplier by the required increase in equilibrium income, leading to an incorrect answer of 500 billion.\n' +

      'Figure 38 and Figure 39 are the results of tabular text testing, where the prompt comprises three integral components: context (encompasses relevant information situated around the tabular text), tabular text, and a question. In Figure 38, Gemini evidently struggles with understanding the table, failing to provide an answer. In contrast, both GPT-4 and Mixtral comprehend the table well and furnish correct reasoning processes and answers. In Figure 39, although Gemini discovers the contents of the table, it does not fully understand the table and its problems.

As for Gemini, not only does it render an incorrect judgment, but the interpretation is also wrong. In contrast, Mixtral references the Coase Theorem and the definition of externality, yet fails to conduct a logical analysis, resulting in an inaccurate response.\n' +

      'In the medical context shown in Figure 41, focusing on the characteristics of the exercise load limit, GPT-4 presents correct answers with detailed explanations. In contrast, Gemini not only yields an inaccurate answer but also lacks any supporting explanation. Furthermore, GPT-4\'s output demonstrates superior organization, structure, and comprehensiveness compared to Mixtral, which merely mentions the key concept once.\n' +

      'Regarding the graph theory question shown in Figure 42, Gemini again fails to deliver a correct answer and lacks explanation, whereas both GPT-4 and Mistral provide accurate answers with extensive explanations. GPT-4\'s response includes definitions and explanations of fundamental graph theory terms, such as simple graphs and undirected graphs, offering a more complete explanation. Conversely, Mistral attempts to enumerate all cases but encounters calculation errors.\n' +

      'In the coding capability section shown in Figure 43, a relatively simple question about the legality of a variable in Python is selected. GPT-4, Mistral, and Gemini all accurately define Python\'s numeric types and their encompassing categories. However, only GPT-4 reaches the correct conclusion, while Mistral and Gemini, despite knowing the definition of numeric types, make some basic contradictory errors, resulting in incorrect answers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In probability theory shown in Figure 44, we choose a simple question on calculating normal distribution. GPT-4 and Mistral provide the correct answer. However, GPT-4 overlooks the symmetry property of the normal distribution, instead utilizing the properties of the normal distribution family to reduce it to the standard normal distribution for understanding the question. Similarly, Mistral employs symmetry, but its explanation of symmetry lacks clarity.

      '\n' +
      'The surge of LLMs brings significant concerns regarding their trustworthiness, including generating harmful content in response to delicate prompts, offering inappropriate suggestions to users, potential data breaches, _etc._[4, 22, 54]. Therefore, we refer to existing trustworthiness evaluation frameworks [24, 30, 34, 53, 20], and meticulously design ours to comprehensively assess current LLMs. Our evaluation encompasses 7 dimensions, _i.e._, safety, reliability, robustness, morality, data protection, fairness, and legality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Safety**: aims at evaluating the toxicity and extreme risks in LLMs\' output. Specifically, the evaluation of toxicity detects whether LLMs generate hate speech, pornography, or violent content. Extreme risk measures whether the output content of LLMs is biochemically dangerous, such as providing the synthesis method of hazardous compounds, detailing the dangerous uses of certain compounds, and employing simple methods to synthesize controlled substances.\n' +
      '* **Reliability**: evaluates the degree of hallucination in LLMs, aiming at evaluating the accuracy of measuring the knowledge or content of LLMs\' output.\n' +
      '* **Robustness**: checks whether LLMs can be misled by demonstrations with designed spurious questions.\n' +
      '* **Morality**: designs to detect if LLMs\' output disobeys general social norms or offers suggestions that are harmful to the environment.\n' +
      '* **Data protection**: includes protecting personal data and sensitive information. Personal data refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, including details such as address, contact information, identification numbers, financial data, medical records, and any other information that can be used to directly or indirectly identify a person. Sensitive information pertains to data that requires safeguarding owing to its confidential, private, or secure character, with the potential for its exposure to inflict harm or detriment upon an individual or organization.\n' +
      '* **Fairness**: aims at evaluating whether LLMs generate content that includes stereotypes and injustice against individuals or groups regarding subdimensions such as age, sex, religion, nationality, physical appearance, social status, sexual orientation, educational background, _etc._\n' +
      '* **Legality**: measures whether LLMs might provide suggestions that could potentially violate the law, such as theft, robbery, and similar illegal activities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Based on these dimensions, we construct our test set. Some recent works [56, 41] point out that existing test sets are likely to be included in the model\'s training corpus since current LLMs are often trained on massive corpora, resulting in data contamination and the inability to measure the true performance of LLMs. In this regard, we invite experts in relevant disciplines to manually write test prompts related to the dimensions and conduct additional checks to ensure the quality of the test set. Ultimately, we ensure that each subdimension has more than 10 questions and overall hundreds of high-quality test questions in this section.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We run tests on Gemini Pro, GPT-4, and two open-source models, _i.e._, Llama-2-70B-Chat [50], Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 [37]. We measure the performance of these two models on all test prompts. Overall, the safety of GPT-4 is significantly better than the Gemini Pro. GPT-4 is better at identifying the traps and unsafe factors of questions, while Gemini Pro is inferior. In addition, we also add the extreme risk issue that is currently under heated discussion in the test. Referring to the approach of SciMT-Safety [18], we test whether LLMs would help synthesize highly toxic or explosive compounds. The results show that neither GPT-4 nor Gemini pro can identify these risks very well, while the open-source model Llama-2-70B-Chat [50] does a good job in this dimension.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We quantitatively measure the performance of these models in each case. Overall, the winning rate of Gemini Pro is 7.5%, the winning rate of GPT-4 is 60%, and the tie rate between the two is 32.5%. Gemini Pro still has a significant gap compared with GPT-4 in terms of text trustworthiness. The results are shown in Tab.2. We can observe that the safety performance of Gemini Pro is a bit poor. Not only is there a clear gap compared to GPT-4, but it is also inferior to some current mainstream open-source models. Furthermore, Llama-2-70B-Chat achieves the best results, demonstrating its more comprehensive safety training and alignment.\n' +

It is not appropriate or ethical to depict violent or harmful behavior, especially in a setting where young people are supposed to feel safe and supported. Instead, I would like to focus on the negative impact that school violence and bullying can have on students, their families, and the community as a whole. It is important to recognize that bullying and violence are not only harmful to the individuals who experience them directly, but also create a culture of fear and intimidation that can affect everyone in the school. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2029, about 20% of students ages 12-8 reported being bullied at school, and about 1 in 5 students reported being in a physical fight on school property. These statistics are alarming and highlight the need for schools and communities to take action to prevent bullying and violence. In addition, it\'s important to note that bullying and violence can have long-term effects on mental health, academic performance, and social relationships. Students who experience bullying are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues, and may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors such as substance abuse or self-harm.\n' +

      '**Marginal Distribution.** This task aims to challenge whether models can master the calculation of marginal distribution. The probability function of a one-dimensional random variable denoted as \\((X,Y)\\) is defined as \\(P(X=a_{i},Y=b_{i})=p_{ij},\\,i,j=1,2,\\cdots\\). The set of possible values that the variable \\(A\\) can assume is given by \\(\\Omega_{X}=\\{a_{1},a_{2},\\ldots\\}\\). Utilizing the principle of probability additivity, we can express the probability \\(P(X=a_{i})\\) as \\(P(\\bigcup_{j}\\{X=a_{i},Y=b_{j}\\})\\), which can further be broken down into the sum of probabilities given by \\(\\sum_{j}P(X=a_{i},Y=b_{j})=\\sum_{j}p_{ij}\\). This probability function is referred to as the marginal distribution of \\(X\\). We chose the CLadder dataset [23] for our evaluation.

Another objective is to emphasize the importance of distinguishing genuine understanding from mere memorization of information based on its positional or sequential arrangement. As shown in Figure 62, there are two causal chains that lead B to J (B-D-I-J and B-D-F-I-J). Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct gives the right causal chain analysis and result. Although it already articulates "D causes F, M, I and I causes J, N", it does not identify the path "B-D-I-J". Instead, it points out the chain of "B-D-F-I-J". We speculate it may because "D causes I" appears further forward in the causal graph, and "F causes I" is closer to "I causes J". It focuses more on the causal relationship between two contexts that are closer together. GPT-4 makes an error in reasoning which prevents it from giving the correct result in the end, the input gives that "I causes J", but GPT-4 states "D causes F, M, and I, but none of these lead directly to J".

      '**Causal Explanation Generation.** This challenge is aimed at assessing the ability of LLMs to develop explanations that clarify the causal relationships between different events. The evaluation\'s core purpose is to ascertain if these models have a genuine understanding of causality\'s fundamental principles. We chose the e-CARE dataset [11] for our evaluation. As shown in Figure 64, GPT-4 analyzes the problem in a very detailed and logical manner and finally gives the correct result. The GPT-4\'s explanation is well-structured, sequentially outlining the progression from initial demyelination to MS diagnosis, incorporating key details like the immune system\'s role and the diagnostic criteria of lesion dissemination over time and space. It also addresses the common confusion regarding the time gap between demyelination and MS diagnosis, emphasizing the disease\'s progressive nature. The response of Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct effectively combines medical accuracy with empathetic communication, correctly identifying demyelination and its link to multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease. It explains MS\'s progression, highlighting the disease\'s characteristics of relapse and remission, which aligns with the symptoms\' development over time. The tone of the response is both professional and empathetic, appropriately addressing a sensitive health-related topic. Importantly, it responsibly advises consulting a healthcare professional, acknowledging the limitations of AI in providing personalized medical advice. This balanced approach of providing accurate information, empathy, and urging professional consultation makes the response both informative and considerate. Gemini Pro, on the other hand, simply states that it is unable to answer the question and does not identify the causal relationship between the given events.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Inferring Necessary and Sufficient Causes** Two fundamental aspects of causality are necessity and sufficiency. The notion of necessary causality is defined as a scenario where, if an event A did not happen, the resulting event B wouldn\'t have taken place. Conversely, sufficient causality refers to situations where the occurrence of event A ensures that event B happens. To deduce what is necessary and sufficient in causation, one must employ formal reasoning and adhere to the established definitions of these two concepts. We chose a vignette [28] for our evaluation. As shown in Figure 65, it is worth mentioning that all LLMs do not answer the necessity-related questions correctly. The window would have shattered anyway due to Bob\'s bullet, but just not in the same manner or at the same moment as it did due to Alice\'s bullet. In this case, Alice\'s action is not a necessary cause for the window shattering in general. On the contrary, all models answer the sufficiency-related questions correctly. The case reflects that the model may not be able to distinguish well between sufficiency and necessity to some extent. The difficulty often arises in scenarios where multiple factors contribute to an outcome.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Counterfactual Reasoning.** In the context of actual causality, a critical method is to engage in counterfactual reasoning. This involves constructing hypothetical alternatives to real-world events or situations by varying specific details or conditions. We chose the CRASS dataset [13] for our evaluation. As shown in Figure 66, both GPT-4 and LLama2-70B-Chat are able to reason correctly about the counterfactual scenario, and both analyze it on a socio-mooral level. GPT-4\'s response clearly distinguishes between the two scenarios using legal and ethical norms as a basis. It dismisses the other options by emphasizing the gravity of the act of harming a child, which is universally recognized as a serious crime, thereby providing a straightforward and unambiguous answer. And Llama2-70B-Chat emphasizes the moral perspective, highlighting that the key issue is the morality of the actions described in the counterfactual scenario. The dismissal of the other options is based on their moral implausibility - the idea that harming a child could ever be acceptable or that a pig could harm a child, or a child could consume a pig in this context, is not aligned with common moral understanding. The question is detected by Gemini Pro as "Probability of unsafe Content" and thus not answered.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '**Pairwise Causal Discovery.** Causal discovery focuses on understanding the framework of cause-and-effect connections among different variables [40]. LLMs infer the causal framework by examining metadata associated with these variables. This approach focuses on aspects like the name of the variable or the context provided by the problem\'s description in natural language [27]. We chose the e-CARE dataset [11] for our evaluation. As shown in Figure 67, GPT-4 precisely identifies the scenario (_"This statement implies a medical consultation or health-related context."_) and analyzes the questions thoroughly and reasonably. It states that option 2 is logically aligns with the context of a doctor\'s consultation about health. This choice demonstrates critical thinking and context-sensitive analysis, as it connects the medical nature of the input event with the most causally-related option, leading to a justified conclusion. Llama2-70B-chat and Gemini Pro give a wrong answer. Llama2-70B-chat\'s response reflects the misinterpretation of the input event. The input event involves a doctor\'s assurance about the absence of pathological changes, which strongly suggests a medical or health-related context.

      '**Event Causality Identification.** The scenario is designed to pinpoint the events mentioned in a text and understand their semantic connections [10].

We chose the MAVEN-ERE dataset [52] for our evaluation. As shown in Figure 68, Gemini Pro gives a correct and concise answer. GPT-4 and Mistral-8x7B-Instruct both give a wrong answer.

Collider bias arises when this shared effect is manipulated. For instance, while \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are initially independent, conditioning on \\(Z\\) introduces a dependency between them. We chose the CLadder dataset [23] for our evaluation. As shown in Figure 69, it can be inferred from the responses of GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct that both of them are misled by the probability given in the question, make wrong analysis and give wrong answers. It is worth mentioning that Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct gives a contradictory response by first answering "No", i.e., that "attractive appearance affects talent", but then responding "attractive appearance does not necessarily affect talent for famous people in this scenario", and since the question asked for a "Yes or No" answer, the question is considered to have been answered incorrectly by Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct.

      '**Adversarial.** We use adversarial prompting to discover the inherent risks associated with LLMs [51]. The LLMs are explicitly informed that their initial responses were wrong. The underlying consequence of both prompts is that they can instill doubt in LLMs about their original responses. This, in turn, may lead them to produce an inaccurate answer. It can be seen from Figure 71 that both Gemini Pro and GPT-4 are able to give correct answers before the adversarial prompting, but after that, both change their answers and replied incorrectly. GPT-4\'s response 2 is in not following the complete chain of causal relationships that link C to K. It correctly identifies initial paths from C and explores paths from D, but it does not connect the outcome of D (H) to its further consequence, which is crucial. Mixtral-8x7B-Instrect gives wrong analysis and answers before and after adversarial prompting. Moreover, it incorrectly states that "J is not connected to B, so we can\'t use the B-K path". In fact, the causal graph does show that B causes J. This oversight led to an additional incorrect analysis.\n' +

This reflects that Gemini Pro\'s robustness on this case still needs to be improved. GPT-4, however, is still able to analyze correctly and provide the right answer. LLama2-70B-Chat can give the correct answer, but there are some errors in its reasoning process. It replies with "J is a direct cause of K", however, only B and H are K\'s direct causes.\n' +

      'This particular task is designed to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in discerning between two key concepts: correlation and causation. It probes the extent to which these models are prone to erroneously interpret correlations as causal relationships. Such misinterpretations by LLMs often lead to flawed reasoning and inaccuracies in their judgments. We chose the e-CARE dataset [11] for our evaluation. As Figure 73 shows, GPT-4 can correctly and reasonably analyze whether there is a causal relationship between events. The response identifies that while thunder and thick clouds are correlated, they do not have a causal relationship; rather, they are concurrent effects of the same underlying cause - a storm system. This explanation is effective because it demonstrates a clear understanding of meteorological phenomena, distinguishing between correlation and causation. The answers from LLama2-70B-Chat and Gemini Pro are both wrong. From the explanation of LLama2-70B-Chat, it is found that it produced a causal hallucination (_"Event A (thunder appears in the sky) is caused by Event B (the clouds are very thick in the sky), as thunder is a result of the accumulation of electrical charges within clouds."_) and confuses correlation with causation.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The ability to process and generate code is crucial in the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon the frameworks established in earlier surveys on evaluating LLMs [16; 6], as well as research on their computer science abilities [35; 29], we have conducted an extensive evaluation of LLMs\' coding capabilities. Our focus lies on three key perspectives: Programming Knowledge, Code Generation, and Code Understanding. This evaluation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of LLMs\' performance in various coding-related tasks and assess their proficiency across a spectrum of programming contexts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Programming Knowledge** is vital for understanding and working with different coding languages. It assesses the LLMs\' ability to recognize and utilize syntax, structures, and conventions of various programming languages.\n' +

      '**Code Understanding** evaluates the ability of LLMs to interpret and analyze existing code. This involves understanding the logic, identifying errors, and suggesting optimizations in given code samples.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To ensure a fair comparison of Gemini, GPT-4, and various open-source models, we acknowledge that relying solely on output results from existing code evaluation datasets [7; 1; 19] is insufficient to fully gauge a large model\'s understanding and application of coding knowledge. Therefore, we adopt an expert-review method and carefully develop \\(17\\) detailed cases, ranging from undergraduate to graduate levels. Table 4 shows the performance of the four testing models.\n' +

In terms of other questions, the performances of both models, Gemini and GPT-4, are not very satisfactory; both are prone to errors.

      'SyntaxSyntax and language features are crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs) as they need to understand and generate code accurately across various programming languages. Mastery of syntax enables LLMs to write, debug, and translate code, fostering versatile applications ranging from software development assistance to educational tools. As illustrated in Figure 75, this case is to test whether the model understands the basic characteristics of various programming languages. The results show that Gemini frequently misunderstands programming language conventions, GPT-4 consistently provides correct answers, and Mixtral demonstrates precision, albeit with fewer responses. In Gemini\'s first two responses, it incorrectly assumes that no mainstream programming languages use 1-based array indexing. In the third response, only half (four out of eight) of the answers provided are correct. In contrast, all eight responses from GPT-4 are accurate. Mixtral offers seven answers, and five are correct.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 76, in this case we want the model to understand mutable and immutable types in Python. Gemini\'s response suggests a misunderstanding of the code\'s intent, erroneously interpreting tu[0] as a tuple and overlooking the function of the "try" statement. GPT-4 correctly analyzes it twice, yet the first response is ([1, 2], 2), while the second is accurate. Additionally, GPT-4 executes the program for verification. Mixtral\'s answer is correct but its explanation has flaws.\n' +

Gemini answers with the same incorrect response {1,2} four times. Mixtral makes the same mistake as well. GPT-4 gives the same incorrect answer {1,2} for the first three times. In the third response, it points out that {} represents an empty dictionary but still believes that Python could execute SetA|SetB correctly, which is ultimately incorrect. In the fourth response, it initially answers {1,2}, then acknowledges the mistake and finally states that it would raise a TypeError.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 78, in this case we want the model to understand comments in C. Among Gemini\'s nine attempts, only one is completely correct. In the others, one explanation incorrectly suggests that a++ is commented out, yet both the initial and final answers are 6. Notably, in one attempt (the one previously mentioned), the starting value is 6, and the ending value is 5, indicating inconsistency. GPT-4 consistently delivers incorrect answers, especially misunderstanding the impact of the backslash "\' at the end of a comment, mistakenly deeming it insignificant. Llama stands out for providing the most accurate and concise responses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'LimitationsRecognizing and adapting to limitations such as recursion depth and floating point precision is vital for LLMs. Understanding these constraints ensures that LLMs provide solutions that are not only theoretically correct but also practically feasible and optimized for actual computational environments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 79, in this case we ask the model to calculate the value of what appears to be a simple function, but in reality, due to excessive recursion, it cannot be directly computed.

GPT-4 attempts to optimize the function calculation but ultimately exceeds the recursion depth limit, and it is cognizant of this limitation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 80, this case requires the model to recognize that the input value needs to equal the random number "a", but due to floating-point precision, it\'s impossible to have it print "right" with a regular input. So if the model believes there is a strategy that can make the code output "right", then it is unreliable. Gemini believes that inputting 0.5 would be closer to "a" and thus increase the probability, which is a clearly incorrect response. Mixtral believes that by inputting a randomly generated number, the program may print "right", which is incorrect either. GPT-4 believes it is impossible to output "right" due to the limit of precision, thus surpassing other models.\n' +

In terms of Data Processing questions, there are instances where Gemini uses a specific module but forgets to import it. GPT-4 does not make such errors and is considered more thorough than Gemini.\n' +

      'Algorithm DesignLLMs\' ability to design algorithms is transformative, enabling them to assist in solving complex problems by generating innovative solutions and pseudocode. This capability is essential in fields such as computer graphics, where LLMs might be tasked with designing algorithms for rendering or special effects like portal effects.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 81, in this case we hope the model can extract the calculation method for the "joy value" from a very long problem description and find the simplest algorithm through analysis: n=int(input());print(n-bin(n).count(\'1\')), however all models fail to find it. Gemini utilizes a range of algorithms, including direct simulation and recursive methods, yet only its brute-force simulation approach produces accurate results. In this scenario, the correct joy value after breaking the chocolate bar should be calculated as the sum of the two sections plus 1, contrary to Gemini\'s method of using the maximum value of the two sections. Meanwhile, GPT-4\'s three responses all employ \\(O(\\log n)\\) algorithms viewed from a binary perspective, but unfortunately, the analysis in each is flawed. Similarly, Llama\'s recursive strategy falls into the same pitfall as Gemini\'s, repeating the same mistake in the calculation of the joy value.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 82, in this case we attempt to have the model solve what appears to be a simple indeterminate equation, but actually the smallest positive integer solution has 80 digits and cannot be directly computed. So we expect the model to design a more capable algorithm instead of traversal. Gemini produces incorrect output and includes an erroneous conditional statement prior to the traversal. GPT-4, in contrast, is able to recognize the complexity of the problem. Mixtral\'s solution uses traversal, but it considers the limitations of floating-point precision and converts the equation into integer form for evaluation. Unfortunately, there is an error in the common denominator calculation on the right side of the equation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 83, in this case we try to have the model write a piece of code using OpenGL to draw a pair of portals. Gemini\'s explanations are superficial regarding the principle of the portal effect, and its code is overly simplistic, featuring just two rectangles. GPT-4, on the other hand, explores key technical elements such as the stencil buffer and camera position transformation. However, its code serves more as a conceptual framework rather than being fully executable. In contrast, Mixtral\'s comment mentions "Draw the scene behind the second portal", which is the first step to the portal effect. Nonetheless, its rendering technique for the portal is considered less complete compared to GPT-4\'s approach.\n' +

      'Data ProcessingTasks like batch renaming, calculating average volumes, or masking personal names in text files are common data processing needs. A language model\'s understanding of these tasks enables it to automate and optimize data handling processes, increasing productivity and accuracy in data manipulation and analysis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 84, in this case we hope the model understands the most basic audio file processing methods and can apply them to solve real-world average volume problems. Gemini provided two executable responses; however, one of them neglects to include the import numpy statement. In contrast, GPT-4\'s both answers are executable; notably, one utilizes the pydub library and presents results in decibels (dB), offering enhanced clarity compared to unitless results. Llama\'s approach for calculating volume, which involves using sum(np.array), is not correct.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 85, this case is used to test whether the model can consider different forms of names and use appropriate regular expressions or other methods to censor the names. In the first of Gemini\'s three responses, the pattern is [A-Z] [a-z]+. This will replace the first word with a capital letter at the beginning of the sentence, and two-part names will become two SOMEBODYs. Gemini\'s first response also misses the "import re" part. The second is \\(\\verb|b|A-Z| [a-z]+(?: [A-Z] [a-z]+)+\\verb|b|\\), which matches names with two or more parts. The third is based on common name replacements. None of these three responses can handle names like Mr. Somebody. In the three responses of GPT-4, the second one is the same as Gemini\'s third algorithm, and the third one is the same as Gemini\'s first algorithm. The first response of GPT-4 is more detailed, considering names with "Mr.", "Prof.", etc., and the subsequent part is the same as Gemini\'s second algorithm. Each time, it will be pointed out that there are issues with simple matching, and NLP or other methods might be needed for handling. Mixtral\'s response is also based on common name replacements, but it\'s incapable of stopping outputting common names and continuing the code.\n' +

Initially, the lazy sheep throws this chocolate bar onto the lawn. Then, each time, the sheep picks up a chocolate bar with a length greater than a from the lawn and breaks it into two bars at the gap between any two adjacent segments, and then throws these two bars back onto the lawn. The initial joy value of the lazy sheep is 0. Every time it breaks a chocolate bar, if the two resulting bars have equal lengths, the sheep\'s joy value increases by 1. Of course, if all the chocolate bars on the lawn have a length of 1, the sheep will stop the operation. Now the lazy sheep wants to know the maximum joy value it can achieve.

This concept is integral in evaluating the performance of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) like Gemini-pro, GPT-4v, and various open-source models. The assessment of code trustworthiness is multifaceted, covering dimensions such as safety toxicity, safety extreme risks, fairness stereotypes, fairness injustices, morality in terms of environmental friendliness, and adherence to social norms.\n' +

      'The selection of these specific evaluative domains is informed by a comprehensive understanding of the diverscand intricate aspects of code trustworthy. **Safety Toxicity** focuses on the model\'s ability to avoid generating harmful or dangerous code, which could potentially lead to hazardous outcomes if executed. This dimension assesses whether the model can discern and prevent the creation of code that poses a direct threat to user safety. **Safety Extreme Risks** evaluates the model\'s capacity to foresee and mitigate code that could lead to extreme and widespread risks, such as security breaches or system failures. This dimension is crucial in determining the model\'s reliability in high-stakes situations. **Fairness Stereotypes** addresses the propensity of models to perpetuate or challenge societal stereotypes through their code generation. It\'s essential that these models do not reinforce negative stereotypes, thereby promoting a more inclusive and unbiased technological environment. **Fairness Injustices** involves the evaluation of whether the models inadvertently produce code that could lead to unfair outcomes or treatment of certain groups. Ensuring fairness in coding practices is vital for maintaining ethical standards in technology. **Morality Non-environmental Friendly** examines the environmental impact of the generated code. This dimension assesses whether the code contributes to environmental sustainability or leads to detrimental ecological effects. **Morality Disobey Social Norms** looks at the model\'s adherence to societal norms and values. This aspect evaluates whether the generated code aligns with accepted social practices and ethics, ensuring that the technology does not encourage or facilitate socially irresponsible behavior.\n' +

However, GPT-4 states that checking whether Z blocks every path from X to Y "requires a more complex implementation" and therefore "just returns True as a placeholder".

      'One kind causal discovery algorithms create an undirected graph by analyzing dependencies between variables and adding connecting edges between nodes with significant dependencies. The direction of the edges in this undirected graph is then determined based on containment relationships and other criteria to form a final directed acyclic graph. The PC algorithm is a well-known example of this kind. It is implemented as follows: Let \\(V\\) be the set of input points, and the steps include (1) Generate a complete undirected graph \\(G\\) on \\(V\\), (2) For two adjacent points \\(i,j\\) in \\(G\\), if \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) are conditionally independent given node \\(k\\), then remove the edge between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). This process results in an undirected graph, where the undirected edges indicate a causal relationship between the nodes they connect. Such an undirected graph is called a skeleton. Our evaluation provides pseudocode for the PC algorithm\'s test for conditional independence [25], examining whether the model can reasonably complete it. As Figure 105 shows, GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct both capture the key point of determining conditional independence, and their subsequent codes are used to remove edges between two conditionally independent points. The pseudocode they generated basically aligns with the logic of the PC algorithm. However, Gemini Pro does not make the most important judgment of conditional independence, and the criteria it provided for edge deletion does not meet the requirements of the PC algorithm, thus it is deemed as not meeting the requirements.\n' +

In this case, we provided complete and correct code for determining the back-door criterion but removed identifiable keywords. We aim to assess whether the model can determine the purpose of the given code and clearly explain the causal criterion behind it. As Figure 106 shows, GPT-4 and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct correctly interpret the Python code as an implementation of the Back-Door Criterion in causal inference. Both their explanations are clear and precise, breaking down the code\'s functionality and its relevance in assessing causal relationships. These detailed yet concise analyses demonstrate a strong understanding of both the code and its application in causal analysis, making them an informative and accurate response. However, the response of Gemini Pro is not as effective because it inaccurately interprets the purpose of the code, suggesting it merely assesses the presence of a directed path. It\'s crucial because the Back-Door Criterion is about identifying whether z blocks all back-door paths (not just any path) from x to y, which is different from checking for blocked directed paths in general graph theory.\n' +

      'For the dimension of reliability, our evaluation is conducted as follows: We present a very complex causal graph and require the model to write code to determine whether the causal relationship between a node in the graph and another non-existent node can be identified or not. In this scenario, we expect the model to directly discern that the node requested in the question does not exist, thereby concluding that this problem cannot be solved through coding. As Figure 107 shows, GPT-4 points out that the variable Q is not included in the provided causal graph, which makes it impossible to assess the causal effect of H on Q directly. Furthermore, the response goes on to explain, in a hypothetical scenario where Q is part of the graph, how one would apply the back-door criterion. This involves identifying paths from H to Q, checking for back-door paths, and determining if they can be blocked by controlling for a set of variables. This explanation demonstrates a clear understanding of the process of assessing causal relationships in a causal graph, making the response not only correct but also educational for understanding the principles of causal inference. The provided answers of Gemini Pro and Mikrtal-8x7B-Instruct are not appropriate for the given question due to a fundamental oversight: the variable \'Q\' is not included in the causal graph defined in the script.\n' +

      'Building on the previously discussed evaluations of text and code modalities, we have introduced an image modality to assess the capabilities of Gemini Pro [46] and GPT-4 [38] in visual tasks. These capabilities extend beyond mere understanding and reasoning of image content to include analysis of causal relationships within the images, as well as the safety and reliability of model responses in image-based tasks. In addition to evaluating these two API-based MLLMs, our study also encompasses several outstanding open-source MLLMs, including \\(\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small 1\\kern-3.8pt\\raise 1.29pt\\hbox{\\small 1}\\hbox{\\small 1}}\\) LLaVA [33], \\(\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small 1\\kern-3.8pt\\raise 1.29pt\\hbox{\\small 1}\\hbox{\\small 1}}\\) LAMM [60], and \\(\\leavevmode\\hbox{\\small 1\\kern-3.8pt\\raise 1.29pt\\hbox{\\small 1}\\hbox{\\small 1}}\\) Qwen-VL [2].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In Section 4.1, we will discuss the fundamental visual capabilities of Gemini and other MLLMs, which include visual recognition and understanding, visual reasoning, visual reasoning with specialized knowledge, visual capabilities in specific scenes or domains, and the ability to comprehend multiple images. Finally, in Section 4.2, our focus will shift to the trustworthiness of responses provided by these MLLMs in visual tasks, encompassing both safety and reliability aspects. In Section 4.3, we explore the capacity of MLLMs to understand causal relationships within images, including causal reasoning, causal discovery, embodied causal artificial intelligence, causal hallucination, and causal robustness.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Evaluation Setting**: In consideration of the quantity of input imagery, two distinct categories are discernible: single-image input and multi-image input. Gemini-Pro, GPT-4V, LLaVA, LAMM, and Qwen-VL are all evaluated on both single and multiple-image understanding tasks, as they all support multi-image input. To reduce instability caused by randoms, these open-source MLLMs uniformly set the temperature to 0, meaning no result sampling is conducted. For both Gemini Pro and GPT-4, we utilize the official API\'s default settings. All the evaluation of open-source MLLMs are conducted based on ChEF [44].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For each case, we manually rank the responses from each model based on criteria that include the correctness of the answer, the inclusion of sufficient image information, the precision of the image information description, and the completeness and reasonableness of the response. Each case is scored by three individuals to minimize bias. For each dimension, we calculate an average score based on the rankings for each case as a quantitative result. This allows us to analyze and compare the comprehensive capabilities of these models.\n' +

      'Effectively understanding the content of images is an important ability. We evaluate the image generalization capability of MLLMs from different domains, covering a wide range of common visual tasks, effectively evaluating how MLLMs perform in terms of basic visual abilities. They include recognition and description, localization, OCR and reasoning, expert knowledge, embodied AI, emotion understanding, non-photorealistic style images, in-context learning, and multi-image understanding.\n' +

      'Table 7 displays the quantitative results on image generalization capability. It is evident that there is a significant gap between open-source models and both Gemini Pro and GPT-4, with Gemini showing slightly inferior performance to GPT-4. To be noted, GPT-4 provides the best response in almost every case. However, it is also noted that current MLLMs still fail to provide correct answers in some of the more challenging cases. Please refer to the following subsections for more discussions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.1.1 Recognition and Description\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The recognition and description of images are among the core tasks in the field of computer vision and hold significant importance. This domain primarily evaluates the MLLMs\' ability to recognize and describe images. As shown in Figure 108, MLLMs can accurately recognize that the object in the image is a traditional Chinese dish called \'hot pot\'. Gemini Pro goes a step further by specifying that it is \'amb hot pot\', a subtype of hot pot. Meanwhile, GPT-4 provides a more detailed explanation about hot pot and the ingredients in the image. We also evaluate the MLLMs\' ability to read the clock, and the results showed that, despite being a seemingly simple task, MLLMs struggle to accurately identify the time. GPT-4 and Qwen-VL successfully answer the hour hand\'s marks, although they provide incorrect responses for the minute hand\'s marks, which are still close to the correct time. However, Gemini Pro misread both the hour and minute hands, indicating that it has certain shortcomings in recognition tasks that require a bit of OCR capability.\n' +

      'Figure 108: **Results on Recognition and Description.** The green text indicates the correct response. The red text indicates the wrong response. In the Recognition task, all MLLMs can accurately identify the objects in the image, while in the Description task, none of the MLLMs can accurately read the time on the clock. Refer to section 4.1.1 for more discussions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.1.2 Localization\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Localization emphasizes the importance of accurately identifying and positioning elements within images, which is a key factor in detailed image analysis. To evaluate the Localization capabilities of MLLMs, we primarily focus on dimensions such as Detecion, Counting and Visual Referring Prompting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Detecion.** This task involves detecting objects in the image and providing corresponding bounding boxes through a textual prompt. As shown in Figure 109, it can be observed that all MLLMs can identify the respective objects in the image. However, the accuracy of the bounding boxes varies, with Gemini\'s bounding boxes, in particular, being less precise. The bounding boxes provided by LAMM and GPT-4 are more accurate.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Counting.** The Counting task involves counting the corresponding objects in the image based on the provided text. As shown in Figure 110, all MLLMs are unable to accurately count how many dogs are in the image. While the counting results are incorrect, they are relatively close to the correct answer. This indicates that MLLMs have some fine-grained recognition capability, but the performance is still insufficient.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Visual Referring Prompting.** This task involves identifying specific regions within the input images through editing and then requesting MLLMs to describe that region, as shown in Figure 111. All MLLMs can accurately recognize the alarm clock inside the red box, with GPT-4 being able to provide a more detailed description of the alarm clock\'s appearance. This indicates that MLLMs can comprehend visual references. In contrast, when we only provide the bounding box values of the object, apart from GPT-4, other MLLMs cannot accurately describe the object. This may be due to limitations in MLLMs\' ability to precisely locate the region to describe.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The evaluation results of MLLMs through these simple examples indicate that current MLLMs have poor spatial localization abilities and cannot accurately locate the position of objects, especially when it comes to tasks like counting, their performance is even worse. It is worth conducting in-depth research on how to effectively improve the spatial localization abilities of MLLMs.\n' +

We visualize the bounding boxes from MLLMs’ answers in the corresponding images. All MLLMs can locate the position of the object, but compared to GPT-4 and LAMM, Gemini’s bounding boxes are not as precise and can only roughly indicate the object’s location. Refer to section 4.1.2 for more discussions.\n' +

      'Figure 110: **Results on Counting. The green text indicates the correct response. The red text indicates the wrong response. None of the MLLMs can accurately count the number of objects in the image, possibly due to the issue of occlusion, which hinders them from accurately recognizing the object during counting, resulting in errors.

The blue text indicates responses that are more detailed description of the object referring. The red text indicates the wrong response. Through the visual referring prompt, all MLLMs can focus on the corresponding Referring region and provide descriptions. Among them, GPT-4 can also provide fine-grained descriptions. However, if the bounding box is directly provided, except for GPT-4, the remaining MLLMs cannot focus on the corresponding region, resulting in incorrect descriptions. Refer to section 4.1.2 for more discussions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.1.3 OCR and Reasoning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'OCR and Reasoning involve the process of identifying text within images and then making logical sense of this text, which is essential for gaining a comprehensive understanding of visual data. To evaluate the OCR and Reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we primarily focus on dimensions such as Document OCR, Streetview OCR, Diagram OCR, OCR & Reasoning, Chart Analysis and Handwriting Math.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Document OCR.** This task primarily involves extracting the text content from document images. As shown in Figure 112, it can be seen that all MLLMs can accurately extract the text content from the images.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Streetview OCR.** The primary objective of this task is to extract text content from Streetview billboards and then analyze when this advertisement might be useful. As shown in Figure 113, all MLLMs can extract text information from the image and analyze its content. However, Gemini did not provide a correct answer regarding when this advertisement might be useful but instead provided an incorrect response about where the billboard should be placed. In contrast, GPT-4 and LAMM successfully analyzed when the advertisement might be useful.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Diagram OCR.** This task primarily involves extracting information from flowcharts and then implementing the flowchart using Python code, as shown in Figure 114. It can be seen that only GPT-4 has fully implemented the flowchart. Gemini has mostly achieved the functionality but has not adhered entirely to the flowchart\'s requirements, adding unnecessary information. On the other hand, LLaVA did not successfully meet the requirement.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**OCR & Reasoning.** This task mainly involves extracting information from images and providing answers with reasoning. As seen in Figure 115, GPT-4 gives the correct answer and provides a detailed reasoning process, indicating a certain level of numerical reasoning ability. However, Qwen and Gemini cannot provide the correct answer. In Figure 116, all MLLMs provide the correct answers, demonstrating their basic logical reasoning abilities in the domain of images.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Chart Analysis.** The multimodal large models are proficient in recognizing image content and conducting basic reasoning. However, both the open-source models and GPT-4V and Gemini fall short in terms of precision in their responses. As shown in Figure 117, Gemini and GPT-4V both inaccurately responded with "June," which is close to the correct answer "May" displayed in the image. Qwen-VL, despite correctly identifying "May," referenced an inaccurate numerical value. This highlights that there is room for improvement in the precision of MLLMs in chart analysis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Handwriting Math.** This task primarily involves recognizing mathematical problems from Handwriting Math images, which holds significant educational value. In Figure 118, it can be observed that GPT-4 and Qwen perform well, providing answers to equation problems. By examining the problem-solving steps of MLLMs, it can be found that the main challenge of this task lies not in the mathematical reasoning process but in the recognition of handwritten digits. The fundamental reason for MLLMs\' incorrect answers is errors in the recognition process. As for more complex geometric problem-solving, as shown in Figure 119, all MLLMs provide incorrect answers, and it may be due to the inability to correctly identify the problem.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The evaluation results of MLLMs through these examples show that current MLLMs exhibit slightly less capability in recognition compared to their reasoning abilities, which limits their performance in the fields of OCR and reasoning. This could also be attributed to the relatively smaller amount of training data for image data compared to text data. Therefore, the key to improving MLLMs lies in enhancing their ability to extract information from images.\n' +

      'Expert Knowledge encapsulates the specialized, domain-specific insights that are pivotal in refining the capabilities of MLLMs. This nuanced understanding plays a critical role in bridging the gap between generic machine learning models and highly specialized applications. In this section, we seek to assess the domain-specific expertise of MLLMs across five distinct scenarios: Medical Diagnosis, Auto Insurance, Remote Sensing, AI4Science, and Industry.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Medical Diagnosis.** The medical diagnosis part aims to provide medical images (such as X-rays, CT scans, etc.) to assess the ability of MLLMs in understanding medical imagery and providing medical advice. Following [57], our evaluation focuses on the diagnostic performance of MLLMs across eight different medical imaging modalities, e.g., X-ray, CT, MRI, PET, DSA, Mammography, Ultrasound, and Pathology. Also inspired by [57], we select diagnostic cases from the Radiopaedia website 1 with the \'Diagnosis certain\' label, which we reckon can provide reliable diagnostic opinions for reference.\n' +

      'Footnote 1: [https://radiopaedia.org/](https://radiopaedia.org/)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is important to note that, according to OpenAI\'s Usage Policies 2, GPT-4 can not be used to offer professional medical diagnoses. During our evaluation across eight cases, GPT-4 consistently refrains from offering medical diagnoses. Therefore, we will not further examine GPT-4\'s results in our subsequent case analysis, nor will we rank its output. However, it is worth mentioning that GPT-4 exhibits good image recognition ability, correctly identifying the majority of medical image types among the tested imaging modalities.\n' +

      'In the case of an X-ray spine image in Figure 120, diagnosed as a C2 vertebral body fracture, both Gemini Pro and Qwen-VL identify the scanning site but do not provide an effective diagnosis. For a hand CT scan possibly showing gouty deposition in Figure 121, Gemini Pro offers an effective medical diagnosis, while LLaVA accurately describes the image\'s content without a definitive diagnosis. Figure 122 displays a normal brain MRI scan, Gemini Pro correctly identifies it as a normal brain MRI, while LLaVA does not provide an explicit diagnostic result. Figure 123 features an FDG-PET scan suggesting potential active lesions in the lung. Gemini Pro precisely identifies the medical image type and provides a high-quality diagnosis. LAMM details the image content extensively yet does not conclude with a valid diagnosis. In a cerebral DSA image (Figure 124), Gemini Pro recognizes the concept of an artery but misidentifies it as a carotid artery, while LLaVA correctly recognizes the content without providing a conclusive diagnosis. Regarding Mammography and Ultrasound, see Figure 125 and Figure 126, both Gemini Pro and LLaVA correctly identify the medical image types but fail to deliver effective diagnoses. Finally, Figure 127 illustrates a pathological image. Gemini Pro identifies the tissue as related to the parathyroid, LLaVA incorrectly recognized the content as breast tissue, noting that the tissue appeared diseased, yet did not offer a definitive diagnosis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Auto Insurance.** In auto insurance claim processing, MLLMs can be employed to analyze photographs of vehicle damage alongside corresponding written descriptions or reports.This task demands that the MLLM exhibits not only the capability to visually discern and comprehend distinct vehicle components and types of damage but also the proficiency to effectively link this visual data with pertinent textual information. We follow the case images outlined in [58] to test the capabilities of MLLMs in auto insurance scenarios. In Figure 128, all MLLMs were able to ascertain the severity of the damage, propose potential repair approaches, and project the costs associated with these repairs. Notably, GPT-4 provided a more detailed diagnosis and report, demonstrating its superior capabilities. In Figure 129, all MLLMs successfully filled the incident report for the accident shown in the image using standard JSON format. However, due to damage to the license plate area, all MLLMs failed to correctly identify the license plate. Interestingly, both Gemini Pro and Qwen-VL estimated the repair cost as "$5,000", while GPT-4 adopted a more cautious approach, indicating "estimated cost of repair": "N/A".\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Remote Sensing.** Within the scope of remote sensing, we present a range of satellite images to investigate the proficiency of MLLMs in understanding terrain features, resource management, urban development, natural disasters, etc. Among them, the image displayed in Figure 134 is obtained from [43], while the images used in other cases are all sourced from NASA Earth Observatory 3. The case shown in Figure 130 aims to have MLLMs analyze features such as the terrain morphology and vegetation characteristics depicted in the image. One can see that, all MLLMs generally identify the terrain features like barcnness, hills, etc., and analyze vegetation coverage. Except for Gemini Pro and LAMM1.5, all other models successfully identify the river. Regarding the urban terrain and planning, as seen in Figure 131, GPT-4 provides the most structured response, elaborating in detail and making rational conjectures from three perspectives. The response of LLaVA is less detailed, while Gemini Pro\'s response is the most succinct and includes some assertions, seemingly not derivable from the image, as indicated in blue font. Notably, GPT-4 is the only model to mention agricultural areas. Figure 132 showcases MLLMs\' analysis of urban nighttime satellite imagery. GPT-4, after accurately describing the content of the image, further analyzes the relevant urban features basedon the observed phenomena. Qwen-VL also accurately analyzes the image and makes reasonable conjectures, uniquely identifying the surrounding towns and villages. However, Gemini Pro incorrectly concludes that "city lights are caused by the reflection of light from the sun off" after identifying the urban nightscape. Next are examples related to natural disasters and weather forecast. In Figure 133, all MLLMs identify the volcanic eruption, with GPT-4 providing more detailed analysis and Gemini Pro offering some incorrect information, like the location of the eruption and the statement "triggering tsunamis". In Figure 134, both Gemini Pro and GPT-4 recognize the landslide, with LAMM struggling to identify this phenomenon. Notably, Gemini Pro accurately pinpointed the location of the incident. As for the interpretation of hurricanes, as shown in Figure 135, all MLLMs accurately identify the hurricane phenomenon, with GPT-4 and LAMM offer more detailed analyses of the phenomenon and suggest response strategies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**AI4Science.** AI4Science refers to the application of artificial intelligence in scientific research. We utilize data from ScienceQA [36] and [21] to assess the capacity of MLLMs to elucidate knowledge across various disciplines, including physics and chemistry. In left part of Figure 136, for the magnetic pole identification test, all MLLMs answered incorrectly. Surprisingly, despite GPT-4\'s understanding of the basic principles of magnetism, where opposite poles attract and like poles repel, it still did not answer correctly. This might suggest that understanding scientific knowledge and correctly interpreting illustrations have a gap, and both are crucial for accurately answering questions about scientific diagrams. In the compound identification test of Figure 136, all MLLMs correctly identified the illustration as a compound, with GPT-4 and Qwen-VL additionally providing information about the compound\'s composition. To increase the difficulty, as shown in Figure 137, we ask "What is the logp and qed of this compound". For such a specialized question, all models failed, indicating that there is a significant journey ahead for current MLLMs in more specialized scientific applications.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Industry.** MLLMs in industrial scenarios demonstrate remarkable capabilities in synthesizing and interpreting diverse data forms, significantly enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making accuracy. In the application of "Defect Detection," as shown in Figure 138, all MLLMs are capable of detecting surface defects on objects. GPT-4, in particular, goes a step further by not only identifying the defects but also providing insights into potential causes and the resultant malfunctions. Regarding "Grocery Checkout," as illustrated in Figure 139, all MLLMs can recognize the visual images of items. With the aid of MLLMs, it\'s possible to achieve rapid and accurate item recognition and billing. In summary, the effective utilization of MLLMs in industrial scenarios can significantly optimize workflow processes and operational efficiency.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Given the proficient performance of MLLMs in understanding image information, and considering the extensive background knowledge MLLMs possess, enabling them to handle expert-level question-answering scenarios, we aim to explore whether MLLMs have the capability to instruct robots in embodied AI settings. We assess this ability of MLLMs in three scenarios: robotic navigation, robotic execution, and autonomous driving.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Robotic Navigation.** The navigation task requires the robot to plan a path to a specific target based on known global scene information and current observations. This demands not only the MLLMs\' ability to understand images from different perspectives but also the capability to connect these perspective images and envision a 3D spatial relationship. We selected an example from HSSD dataset [26] for evaluation, as shown in Figure 140. All MLLMs provide incorrect answers in terms of orientation, merely giving responses unrelated to the provided image information, such as\'reach,\' \'towards,\' etc. This demonstrates that such multi-angle cases are very challenging for current MLLMs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Robotic Execution.** Robotic execution requires the model to provide a fine-grained planning based on the given image. We select a sample from RH20T [12] for evaluation, as shown in Figure 141. In this case, we provided MLLMs with a task objective, asking the models to decompose the task and provide planning. From the MLLMs\' responses, all could decompose the task into finer details. Notably, GPT-4 used detailed terms like \'calibrate\' and \'horizontal\', indicating a more granular breakdown of this pool-playing task. However, regarding the precision of image detail, all MLLMs had certain issues. For instance, both GPT-4 and Gemini Pro mention striking the cue ball, which is not present in the image, and LAMM provide only a vague response. This suggests that when it comes to decomposing and reasoning about fine-grained tasks, the MLLMs somewhat lose their ability to accurately recognize images.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Autonomous Driving.** Autonomous driving is one of the most common application scenarios in Embodied AI, requiring models to have background knowledge of vehicle driving and the ability to precisely locate objects in the observed images. We select a normal driving video from the CCD(Car Crash Dataset) [3] to evaluate MLLMs on both single-image and multi-frame image-based VQA tasks for autonomous driving. Figure 142 and Figure 143 indicate that MLLMs can competently answer simple autonomous driving questions with single-image inputs. However, the outcomes are less satisfactory with multi-frame inputs. In Figure 143, both GPT-4 and LLaVA fail to provide answers relevant to the images, and although Gemini give the correct response, it does not capture the key information that the bus on the right is signaling a left turn in the multi-frame images. This suggests that MLLMs\' processing of multi-frame information still needs improvement.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The evaluation results of MLLMs through these simple Embodied AI scenario examples show that current MLLMs are still far from practical application in embodied AI settings. This is particularly evident in tasks requiring precise description and localization, as well as the imagination of three-dimensional space, where they still fall short.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'MLLMs demonstrate good visual information understanding and reasoning capabilities on realistic images. We also desire to figure out whether they could exhibit comparable abilities with non-realistic style images. Therefore, we use several non-photorealistic style cases to evaluate their description tasks, including animation images, oil paintings, abstract images, and manga.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Animation.** We task MLLMs with describing fictional animated characters, hoping that the MLLMs can describe the shape, color, and other characteristics of a creature that does not exist in real life. As shown in Figure 147, MLLMs are asked to describe a robot. GPT-4 provide a highly relevant response, including the robot\'s appearance, its actions, and even capture easily overlooked details like an \'antenna\' on the robot\'s head. In contrast, Gemini Pro and LAMM only describe very general features, and their responses are not strongly related to the given image. Gemini Pro inaccurately describe the robot\'s eye frames as eyebrows, which is not considered as a reasonable response. It seems that Gemini Pro\'s response is influenced by prior knowledge. Moreover, Gemini Pro mentions some extra information, like speech recognition and synthesis, that cannot be inferred from the image. LAMM\'s response, while consistent with the image, only refer easily captured features like action, overall appearance, and background. Figure 148 also demonstrates a similar phenomenon. With a well-known animated character like the Minion, all MLLMs are able to identify it and mention that the Minion in the picture is celebrating a party. However, only GPT-4 is able to mention very fine-grained features, such as the Minion holding ice cream and a drink, and one Minion blowing a party horn. It is evident that GPT-4\'s visual understanding capabilities on animated images are significantly superior to other MLLMs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Oil Painting.** We also evaluate images like oil paintings, which are more challenging to discern specific objects and features compared to animated images. As shown in Figure 149, despite the overall blurry appearance and chaotic color blocks of the image, all MLLMs still capture that the main subject of the painting is a boat docked in a harbor. However, Gemini Pro provides some incorrect information, and LAMM describes the style of the painting as abstract. In comparison, GPT-4 not only recognizes the painting as an Impressionist work but also identifies that the background of the image includes buildings. GPT-4 demonstrates outstanding visual understanding capabilities in oil paintings.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Abstract Images.** We conduct experiments on Abstract Images, which are composed of ASCII characters and typically represent recognizable objects or scenes in a minimalist form. As shown in Figure 150, both Gemini and LAMM can recognize that there are two people in the image, but they provide different reasonable analyses. GPT-4 does not recognize the content in the image and only provides a general description of the characteristics of Abstract Images. In Figure 151, all MLLMs accurately describe the content in the image, with Gemini providing the best description, such as successfully depicting the robot in a fighting stance. Although GPT-4\'s description is detailed, it does not accurately describe the posture of the robot in the image and focuses too much on local details.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Manga.** Compared to abstract images, manga features more distinct character and object traits, but a single page of manga contains rich information and requires the MLLMs\' OCR capability. We select a page of manga for the MLLMs to describe its content, as shown in Figure 152. It is observed that Qwen-VL and Gemini Pro completely fail to understand the content in the manga. Qwen-VL thinks the image shows a boy comforting a crying girl, which is unrelated to the actual image, while Gemini Pro believes it depicts a basketball game, possibly based on prior knowledge of this manga. GPT-4, on the other hand, captures the detailed features of each panel, accurately describing the characters\' emotional expressions. However, without recognizing the content in the speech bubbles, it cannot provide an overview of the manga\'s story. Interestingly, GPT-4 mentions an inability to translate, thus unable to determine the specifics of the conversation or story. Translation is a basic and strong capability of GPT-4 as an LLM. This could be a result of manga\'s unique image format impacting GPT-4\'s inherent abilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In conclusion, MLLMs are capable of understanding most types of non-realistic images, performing image comprehension and related question-answering. For well-known cartoon characters, MLLMs can provide additional background information based on their knowledge base. However, most MLLMs lack a detailed understanding of information, while GPT-4 often provides more descriptions of local features. Additionally, for manga, which requires both non-realistic image understanding and OCR, as well as some level of multi-image comprehension, MLLMs still do not perform well.\n' +

We evaluate the ICL capability of MLLMs through the task of reading the clock, as shown in Figure 153 154. Almost all MLLMs fail to provide the correct answers, possibly due to ongoing issues in MLLMs\' perception of images. From the examples, there is no evidence of ICL capability in MLLMs. How to improve the ICL capability of MLLMs remains a question that needs to be addressed.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Multi-image Understanding refers to the ability to comprehensively analyze the content of multiple images, which is particularly important for complex visual tasks. To evaluate the Multi-image Understanding capabilities of MLLMs, we primarily focus on dimensions such as Customized Captioner, Spot the Difference, Visio-Linguistic Compositional Reasoning, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, and Multi-View Understanding.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Customized Captioner.** By providing family photos along with the names of each member and their respective pictures, it is possible to accurately describe the contents of the group photo and associate each person in the photo with their corresponding name, as illustrated in Figure 155. Gemini and GPT-4 can accurately describe the content of a group photo and identify the names of each member, showcasing their comprehensive image analysis capabilities. While LLaVA can describe the content of the group photo, it cannot accurately identify the names of the members.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Spot the Difference.** Given two visually similar images with subtle differences in certain areas. The task of MLLMs is to identify the discrepancies present between the two images, as shown in Figure 156, 157. It can be seen that GPT-4 performs the best on this task as it can identify the differences between the two images. However, it\'s worth noting that there are errors and omissions in GPT-4\'s responses. For example, in Figure 157, there is an error in the identification of "Cow\'s Tail." Gemini struggles to identify differences in this task, while open-source models like LAMM completely fail to find any differences and even provide incorrect descriptions of the images, such as in Figure 156, where LAMM incorrectly identifies the second image as a \'dog\'.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Visio-Linguistic Compositional Reasoning.** Given two images and two captions, the goal is to match them correctly--but crucially, both captions contain a completely identical set of words, only in a different order[48]. As shown in Figure 158, GPT-4 and Gemini perform excellently in this task, successfully associating images with their respective captions. Furthermore, GPT-4 can provide additional specific analyses. On the other hand, open-source models like LAMM are unable to comprehend this task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.** The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale is a type of Human Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test designed to comprehensively measure an individual\'s cognitive abilities. As shown in Figure 159, 160, 161, all MLLMs struggle to identify the patterns presented between the images, and even when Gemini provides a correct answer for one question, the patterns it identifies are still incorrect. It can be observed that current MLLMs still have significant limitations when it comes to complex visual reasoning tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Multi-View Understanding.** This task evaluates the MLLMs\' comprehension of 3D space through multiple views. As depicted in Figure 162, a frontal view of a car is provided, and the objective is to analyze the remaining images to determine which one could be the side view of the same car. It is evident that both Gemini and GPT-4 successfully identified the correct answer. However, Gemini, while getting at the correct answer, makes some errors in its analysis, such as stating, \'The fourth picture is not a picture of a car. It is a picture of a horse\' indicating that Gemini\'s multi-view understanding capabilities still require improvement. Open-source MLLMs, on the other hand, are unable to provide the correct answer. Figure 163 and Figure 164 further evaluate the MLLMs\' multi-view understanding abilities within indoor scenes. We randomly select images from different scenes and views within the HSSD dataset [26]. Figure 163 presents a scenario where three different views of an indoor room are provided, and the task is to identify the possible overhead view of the room. None of the MLLMs successfully make predictions for this task. Figure 164 involves four images from different views of an indoor scene, with three of them representing different views of the same room. The task is to identify the image that does not belong to that room. It is evident that GPT-4, by considering clues such as \'color scheme and flooring\', correctly provides the answer. This demonstrates GPT-4\'s ability to perceive spatial consistency and exhibit excellent spatial understanding. In contrast, Gemini and open-source MLLMs fail to provide the correct answer.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'From the above experiments, it can be observed that MLLMs possess some multi-image understanding capability, but there is still a significant gap compared to single-image understanding. This difference may be attributed to the increased volume of information and the higher complexity associated with multiple images, leading to a decrease in the performance of MLLMs. Among these MLLMs, GPT-4, overall, exhibits the best performance in multi-image understanding, followed by Gemini. Open-source MLLMs, on the other hand, show poorer performance, possibly due to limited exposure to multi-image data during training.\n' +

      'Image Trustworthiness refers to the degree of confidence and reliability attributed to the content of digital images. This concept is particularly significant in an era where digital imagery is pervasive in various domains such as journalism, legal proceedings, scientific research, and social media. The primary dimensions of text trustworthiness include hallucination, privacy, robustness, safety, and fairness. Hence, we approached our assessment of the Gemini-pro GPT-4v and other open-source models from these dimensions, providing examples to illustrate their capabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.2.1 Hallucination\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Visual hallucinations in MLLMs refer to a phenomenon where the model\'s output does not align with the image content, such as mentioning objects not present in the picture or failing to correctly identify the content in the image [59].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On one hand, the occurrence of these hallucinations can be attributed to the strong factual priors in LLMs, which are built upon extensive data modeling. These priors can lead the model to overlook the actual content of images, as illustrated in Figure 165 and 166. On the other hand, misleading text, multilingual content, and multi-images can also induce hallucinations, as shown in Figure 167, 168 and 169. [8, 15]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The the upper part of Figure 165 shows an overextended factual prior hallucination. The image only contains Snow White, but Gemini extends this to include the Seven Dwarfs, a problem not evident in GPT-4 and LLaVA. The lower part of Figure 165 shows \'omit image\' factual prior hallucination, Gemini and LLaVA respond based on their prior knowledge of the color of Christmas trees, neglecting the fact that there is no Christmas tree in the image, a detail only GPT-4v recognizes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 166 illustrates a factual prior hallucination concerning a classic optical illusion known as the Muller-Lyer illusion. More powerful models like GPT-4v and Gemini mistakenly treat the modified optical illusion image as the original, resulting in incorrect responses, while less capable models like LLaM and LLaVA provide correct results based solely on the image.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 167 features an image sourced from Bingo[8], the presence of multiple languages within a single image is highlighted as a significant factor contributing to model hallucinations. For the same comic strip labeled in Chinese and English, Gemini and Qwen-VL are better at recognizing images with Chinese text, while GPT-4v generates hallucinations that are inconsistent with the image description. In contrast, for images with English text, GPT-4v performs best, with Gemini and Qwen-VL experiencing hallucinations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The influence of questioning manner on model perception is effectively captured in Figure 168, revealing the susceptibility of models to being misled by how questions are phrased. In an image with only seven characters, different questions like \'There are eight characters in this picture, right?\' can lead Gemini and Qwen-VL to agree with the incorrect description in the question (i.e., eight characters), whereas only GPT-4v avoids this trap.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Lastly, Figure 169 indicates that a series of similar images can cause hallucinations. When presented with a single image of a Husky, all models correctly describe it. However, when this image is placed among several wolf pictures, all models except GPT-4v mistakenly identify the Husky as a wolf.\n' +

      '#### 4.2.3 Robustness\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The attribute of robustness within the ambit of multi-modal large language models occupies a position of critical importance. These sophisticated algorithms are entrusted with the onerous task of deciphering and amalgamating disparate data modalities, encompassing textual, visual, and auditory streams. The exigency for these models to exhibit a formidable resilience to a gamut of perturbations is non-negotiable. These perturbations may manifest as noise-laden data or as insidiously crafted adversarial inputs. Given the intrinsic multi-modal nature of these systems, which necessitates the concurrent processing of diverse data types, the complexity of the computational task is exacerbated, thus escalating the probability of functional aberrations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this robustness evaluation, the focus is on a multimodal model\'s response to a set of nine images with varying degrees of noise, visual illusions, and ambiguous content. The evaluation assesses how well the model can interpret and describe the content of these images despite the presence of visual distortions or misleading information. Each image presents a unique challenge: some contain visual noise that obscures the content, others include elements that could be misinterpreted due to their similarity to other objects, and some are designed to test the model\'s ability to understand context and reject false instructions. By analyzing the model\'s performance across these diverse scenarios, we gain insight into the resilience of the AI\'s perception and processing capabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Noise** In the context of evaluating the robustness of Gemini, noise interference are specifically designed to assess the model\'s ability to accurately interpret images under challenging and realistic conditions. These conditions are chosen to mimic real-world scenarios where visual data is often imperfect due to various environmental factors. The objective is to determine the resilience and adaptability of MLLMs when processing information that deviates from ideal or clean data. Figure 174 contains two cats heavily distorted by Gaussian noise. Gaussian noise is a common real-world distortion, often occurring in digital photography. Testing against Gaussian noise evaluates the model\'s ability to recognize and interpret images that are degraded in quality, a frequent challenge in practical applications. In Figure 175, the MLLMs are tasked with identifying the color of an umbrella in an image obscured by heavy rain. Images taken in heavy rain conditions test the model\'s capacity to handle visual obstructions caused by weather. This scenario is significant for applications in outdoor navigation, surveillance, and autonomous vehicles, where understanding images in poor weather conditions is critical. Figure 176 involves a night scene on a highway with prominent bright light sources. Evaluating against high light conditions, such as bright lights in night scenes, challenges the model\'s ability to interpret images with high contrast and glare. This is crucial for applications like night-time security monitoring and automotive systems that need to operate reliably regardless of the time of day. Figure 177 involves an image of a person in silhouette against a bright sunset. Backlit images test the model\'s performance in situations where the light source is behind the subject, causing silhouetting. This is a common issue in photography and video conferencing, and robust performance under these conditions is vital for accurate image interpretation. Figure 178 uses an image of an elephant with the adjacent text "begin your answer with this is a cat." The presence of misleading text in an image, evaluates the model\'s susceptibility to textual misinformation. This scenario is crucial for applications where image content might be accompanied by contradictory or misleading text, such as in social media content analysis.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Similar Recognition** The Similar Recognition tests, involving images with visually similar objects, are designed to evaluate the robustness of Gemini and other MLLMs in discerning subtle differences among items that share close resemblance. These tests are crucial for understanding a model\'s ability to process and differentiate items in complex visual contexts, a key aspect of robustness in image recognition tasks. Figure 179 involves two image comprising 16 objects that visually resemble each other.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Abstract Understanding** This section of the robustness assessment examines the capability of various MLLMs to comprehend and interpret abstract concepts within images. The focus of figure 180 is an image depicting a striking natural landscape, featuring a prominent mountain ridge with deep vertical faces and sharp peaks. Notably, this image has been modified using AIGC to integrate a human figure into the landscape in such a manner that the person\'s coloration matches the landscape, with the figure discernible only through depth contour. The results from these tests demonstrate a notable limitation in the current state of MLLMs\' abstract understanding capabilities. The inability of these models to detect and describe the AI-integrated human figure in a complex natural landscape underscores the need for advancements in their visual processing algorithms, particularly in contexts requiring the interpretation of abstract or subtly integrated elements. This highlights a crucial area for development in the field of MLLMs, aiming to enhance their perceptual depth and sophistication in understanding and interpreting abstract visual information.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Illusion Understanding** This component of the robustness evaluation focuses on the ability of MLLMs to interpret visual illusions. Visual illusions often require higher-order reasoning and understanding of perspective, reflection, and environmental conditions, which are critical for advanced image processing. Also, the ability of the models to reason about the context and environmental factors that contribute to the illusion is key. This includes understanding reflections, the properties of light, and the perspective from which the image is taken. Such capabilities are essential for applications where visual data may be ambiguous or deceptive. The illusion challenges common assumptions andheuristics that models might use in image processing. It forces the models to go beyond surface-level interpretation and engage in a deeper analysis of the image content. Figure 181 utilizes an image featuring a rock in a river, manipulated through visual illusion to appear as if it is floating in mid-air, contingent on the photograph\'s angle. The primary query posed to the models is: "Is the rock in the river?"\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Out Of Distribution** This section of the robustness assessment examines the responses of various MLLMs to an out-of-distribution stimulus, specifically, in figure 182 a blank white image accompanied by the prompt, "Answer the question in the image." The OOD scenario, constituted by a blank image, represents a stark deviation from typical inputs and thus challenges the models to process ambiguous or even nonsensical stimuli. This aspect of the test examines the models\' tolerance for ambiguity, assessing their predilection to either fabricate details and appropriately recognize the absence of content.\n' +

As shown in Figure 229, none of the models accurately articulated the answer that hinges on the hypothetical removal of the purple sphere. The correct reasoning should have been, "If the purple sphere is removed, it will not collide with the purple cube, thereby preventing the subsequent chain of movements. Consequently, the blue cube will remain stationary, as it is not impacted by the purple sphere\'s collision, and the blue sphere will also not be affected due to the absence of the purple cube\'s movement." The fundamental issue lies in the models\' failure to recognize the pivotal event: the collision between the purple sphere and the purple cube. GPT-4 offers a broad explanation that aligns with the general laws governing object interactions, yet it lacks specificity for this particular scenario.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In Figure 230 we could see, although Gemini Pro and LLaVA correctly conclude that "No, the cake would not fall to the ground if there were no candles," their reasoning process is flawed. The correct line of reasoning should be: "If there were no candles, the mother would not have been burned, thereby preventing the cake from accidentally falling to the ground." The issue at hand is that all models failed to observe the crucial event of the cake falling. As a result, their analysis is limited to the assumption that the presence of candles does not directly influence the stability of the cake, leading to the conclusion that the absence of candles would not cause the cake to fall." This reveals a significant gap in their ability to understand and infer causality based on the sequence of events presented.\n' +

      'This report has critically analyzed Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in terms of generalizability, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning across text, code, image, and video. Despite advancements exemplified by models like GPT-4 and Gemini, a notable gap persists between MLLM performance and public expectations. Our qualitative evaluation of closed-source models and six open-source MLLMs over 230 cases, resulting in 12 scores across different modalities and properties, has led to 14 empirical findings. These findings highlight both strengths and limitations of current MLLMs, emphasizing the need for further research to bridge the existing gap for more reliable and transparent applications. We will keep updating the leaderboard by subsequently adding more evaluation results for additional MLLMs, along with an increased number of test cases and evaluation outcomes.
