      '\n' +
      'Structured pruning of modern large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a way of decreasing their high computational needs. Width pruning reduces the size of projection weight matrices (e.g., by removing attention heads) while maintaining the number of layers. Depth pruning, in contrast, removes entire layers or blocks, while keeping the size of the remaining weights unchanged. Most current research focuses on either width-only or a blend of width and depth pruning, with little comparative analysis between the two units (width _vs._ depth) concerning their impact on LLM inference efficiency. In this work, we show that a simple depth pruning approach can compete with recent width pruning methods in terms of zero-shot task performance. Our pruning method boosts inference speeds, especially under memory-constrained conditions that require limited batch sizes for running LLMs, where width pruning is ineffective. We hope this work can help deploy LLMs on local and edge devices.\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The advancement of large language models (LLMs) [23, 24, 25, 26] has brought significant improvements in language-based tasks, enabling versatile applications such as powerful chatbots [23, 25]. However, the deployment of LLMs is constrained by their intensive computational demands. To make LLMs more accessible and efficient for practical use, various optimization strategies have been actively studied over recent years (see [27, 28] for survey). This work focuses on _structured_ pruning [12, 13], which removes groups of unnecessary weights and can facilitate hardware-agnostic acceleration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the context of compressing billion-parameter LLMs, LLM-Pruner [14] and FLAP [11] narrow the network width by pruning coupled structures (e.g., attention heads and their associated weight connections) while maintaining the number of layers. Sheared-LLaMA [15] reduces not only the network width but also its depth by entirely removing some layers. Despite the existence of pruning methods [15, 16, 17] that incorporate both width and depth aspects, there remains a gap in detailed analysis comparing these two factors (width _vs._ depth), specifically in relation to their impact on LLM inference efficiency.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to substantial model sizes, LLM inference is distinguished by an autoregressive decoding mechanism, which predicts tokens one by one based on the input and the previously generated tokens. This sequential generation process often exhibits a memory-bound nature, leading to considerable underutilization of GPU compute abilities [26, 18]. While expanding batch sizes is a standard way to enhance GPU utilization and throughput, this approach is unfeasible for low-specification GPUs with memory constraints. We aim to improve inference speeds of LLMs, especially under hardware limitations that demand small batch sizes, where we observe that width-only pruning methods are inadequate.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Depth pruning is often regarded as being less effective in performance compared to width pruning, due to the elimination of bigger and coarse units. Contrary to this prevailing view, we show that a simple depth pruning method coupled with a LoRA retraining phase [14]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: Efficiency of pruned LLaMA-7B models on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. Compared to width pruning of FLAP [11] and LLM-Pruner [14], our depth pruning achieves faster inference with competitive PPL on WikiText2 (left) and offers a better latency-throughput trade-off (right; \\(M\\): batch size). See Section C for additional results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'can rival recent width pruning studies for LLMs, including LLM-Pruner [14], FLAP [1], and a structured pruning variant of Wanda [15, 16], in terms of zero-shot task capabilities. Moreover, we present that depth pruning markedly improves inference speeds, particularly when hardware restrictions necessitate running LLMs with limited batch sizes (see Figure 1). Our contributions are summarized as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* In scenarios with limited batch sizes, our work demonstrates that width pruning is difficult to attain actual speedups in LLM\'s autoregressive generation. This aspect has been underexplored in previous works.\n' +
      '* We introduce a simple yet effective strategy for depth pruning of LLMs. We explore various design factors, including the choice of prunable units, the criteria for importance evaluation, and the retraining frequency.\n' +
      '* Our compact LLMs, obtained by excluding several Transformer blocks, achieve inference acceleration. They are for general-purpose use and perform comparably to finely width-pruned models in zero-shot tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Problem: Small-batch LLM Inference\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Most LLMs are autoregressive models that sequentially produce tokens, based on the initial prompt and the sequence of tokens previously generated. The token-by-token generation process often involves multiplying large matrices (weights) with smaller matrices or vectors (activations). The primary bottleneck for inference efficiency is memory access operations rather than the speed of mathematical computations (referred to as\'memory-bound\'), leading to suboptimal use of GPU computing power [17]. Though increasing batch sizes is a standard way to enhance GPU computation and throughput, it poses a risk of out-of-memory (OOM) errors, as depicted in Figure 2,1 unless advanced system-level optimizations [17, 18, 19] are applied.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: Using the HF-Transformers library [16], we ran the LLMs with \\(12\\) input tokens for \\(20\\) batched runs after \\(10\\) warm-ups. Top: Peak GPU compute utilization [17]. Bottom: Mean latency over \\(20\\) runs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this study, our focus is on accelerating the inference of LLMs under small-batch conditions caused by hardware restrictions. Such situations are relevant for deploying LLMs on memory-constrained local devices, which can enhance user experience and data privacy protection. We show that (i) reducing weight shapes via width pruning does not improve generation speeds and can even degrade it when the resulting weight dimensions are unsuitable for GPU capabilities, and (ii) notable speed gains are only achievable through depth pruning that excludes a number of modules entirely.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 3: Comparison of pruning granularities. Width pruning reduces the size of weight matrices while maintaining the number of matrix-level operations. Depth pruning eliminates entire Transformer blocks, or individual MHA and FFN modules, leading to fewer memory accesses and matrix-level operations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: Top: GPU compute utilization of (a)â€“(c) running LLaMA-7B on different NVIDIA GPUs and that of (d) Vicuna-13B. LLM inference is typically constrained by memory access operations, resulting in lower GPU compute usage. Increasing batch sizes can enhance GPU utilization and throughput, but pushing this too far triggers OOM issues. Bottom: Latency results with varying batch sizes and target output lengths (labeled with \\(L\\)). Our depth pruning (blue lines) improves generation speeds over the original models (gray), while width pruning [18] is ineffective (green). The dotted lines show that pruned models can operate with larger batch sizes that cause OOM errors for the original model. The results are obtained with pruning ratios of \\(27\\%\\) for the 7B model and \\(29\\%\\) for the 13B model.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '## 3 Method: Block Pruning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'An LLM is a stack of multiple Transformer blocks [23], each of which contains a pair of multi-head attention (MHA) and feed-forward network (FFN) modules (see Figure 3). We choose this Transformer block as the prunable unit to prioritize reducing inference latency. Our approach is simple and cheap: after identifying unimportant blocks with straightforward metrics, we perform one-shot pruning and light retraining.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Evaluation of Block-level Importance\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We consider the following criteria to evaluate the significance of each block, ultimately selecting the Taylor+ and PPL metrics (see Table 5). Specifically, the linear weight matrix is denoted as \\(\\mathbf{W}^{k,n}=\\left[W_{i,j}^{k,n}\\right]\\) with a size of \\((d_{\\mathrm{out}},d_{\\mathrm{in}})\\), where \\(k\\) represents the type of operation (e.g., a query projection in MHA or an up projection in FFN) within the \\(n\\)-th Transformer block. The weight importance scores are calculated at the output neuron level [23], followed by summing2 these scores to assess the block-level importance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 2: In our exploration of various aggregation strategies (i.e., sum, mean, product, and max operations across module and block levels), summing the scores was effective at different pruning ratios.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Magnitude (Mag).** This metric [15] is a fundamental baseline in the pruning literature, assuming that weights with smaller norms are less informative. For the block-level analysis, we compute \\(I_{\\mathrm{Magnitude}}^{n}=\\sum_{k}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\left|W_{i,j}^{k,n}\\right|\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Taylor.** Assessing the error caused by the removal of a weight parameter helps in identifying its significance. For a given calibration dataset \\(D\\), this can be expressed as the alteration in the training loss \\(\\mathcal{L}\\)[16, 17]: \\(\\left|\\mathcal{L}(W_{i,j}^{k,n};D)-\\mathcal{L}(W_{i,j}^{k,n}=0;D)\\right| \\approx\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{L}(D)}{\\partial W_{i,j}^{k,n}}W_{i,j}^{k,n}\\), where we omit the second-order derivatives by following [14]. We define the block score as \\(I_{\\mathrm{Taylor}}^{n}=\\sum_{k}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j}\\left|\\frac{\\partial\\mathcal{ L}(D)}{\\partial W_{i,j}^{k,n}}W_{i,j}^{k,n}\\right|\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Mag+ and Taylor+.** Upon using the aforementioned metrics, the early blocks are labeled as unimportant, but their removal leads to severe performance drops. Similar to a popular heuristic [17, 16], we preserve the first four and the last two blocks [14] by excluding them from the pruning candidates.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Perplexity (PPL).** Redundant blocks contribute less to the model\'s outputs, and their removal leads to smaller degradation in PPL, a commonly used metric for language modeling tasks. In this context, we physically eliminate each block and monitor its influence on PPL using the calibration set \\(D\\): \\(I_{\\mathrm{PPL}}^{n}=\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{SL}\\sum_{s}\\sum_{l}\\log p_{\\theta^{n }}(x_{l}^{(s)}|x_{<l}^{(s)})\\right\\}\\), where \\(\\theta^{n}\\) denotes the model without its \\(n\\)-th block, and \\(s=1,\\dots,S\\) and \\(l=1,\\dots,L\\) are the indices for sequences and tokens in \\(D\\). The use of PPL can reflect the model\'s behavior by being derived from the next-token prediction loss; it requires only the forward pass, avoiding the need to compute back-propagation gradients [14] and Hessian inverses [23], or to involve a mask learning stage [14]. As shown in Figure 4, several blocks are identified as removable, showing only a slight effect on the PPL metric. The elimination of initial and final blocks significantly degrades the performance, which necessitates keeping them unpruned.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'After sorting the block-level importance scores, we prune the less crucial blocks in a single step. Since every block has an identical configuration and it is easy to calculate the number of parameters for one block, we readily decide how many blocks should be removed to meet the target model size.\n' +

      '### Cost-efficient Retraining\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We efficiently retrain the pruned models with the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method [11, 10]. The weight matrix of the adapted network is expressed as \\(W_{0}+\\Delta W=W_{0}+BA\\), where \\(W_{0}\\) denotes the initial pretrained weight with a shape of \\((d_{\\mathrm{out}},d_{\\mathrm{in}})\\). The update matrix \\(\\Delta W\\) is decomposed into two trainable parts, \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) with dimensions \\((d_{\\mathrm{out}},r)\\) and \\((r,d_{\\mathrm{in}})\\), where \\(r\\) represents a low rank. We demonstrate that LoRA has the potential to restore the performance of depth-pruned models.\n' +

      'LoRA-based retraining can be efficiently completed on a single GPU in just a few hours. For example, retraining a model pruned by 20% from 7B parameters takes about 2 hours and 22GB VRAM, while a model reduced by 21% from 13B demands around 3 hours and 35GB VRAM.\n' +

      '### Comparison with Existing Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Tables 2, 3, and 4 show the zero-shot downstream task performance and inference efficiency of differently pruned models. Diminishing the size of weight matrices through width pruning methods [11, 12, 13] does not lead to latency improvements, as generation speeds with limited input (batch) scales heavily depend on the frequency of memory access operations in LLM inference. This issue is challenging to address solely by reducing the sizes of matrices, unless they are entirely removed. In some cases, it even worsens the inference speed compared to the original model due to GPU-unfriendly operation dimensions (e.g., the hidden sizes of FFN are often not divisible by 8, as shown in Table 1, which hinders the effective utilization of GPU Tensor Cores [1]).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On the contrary, our depth pruning exhibits speedups through the complete removal of several Transformer blocks, resulting in fewer memory access and matrix-level operations between activations and weights. Moreover, under the same retraining setup as [11], our models achieve zero-shot scores on par with finely width-pruned models.\n' +

      'Table 6 shows the results of depth pruning at different granularities. For the models with more than 5B parameters, removing individual MHA and FFN modules results in better downstream task accuracy but worse PPL compared to removing entire Transformer blocks. For smaller models than 5B, block-level pruning achieves superior results in terms of all the examined metrics. This differs from the common belief that removing finer units yields better performance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given the collaborative roles of the modules (i.e., MHA captures dependency relations [21], while skip connections and FFN prevent the rank collapse in purely attention-driven networks [14]), it may be suboptimal to treat them in isolation. Taking the 5.3B model in Table 6 as an example, module-level pruning results in consecutive FFNs in some positions, potentially impairing the model\'s ability to handle word interactions. In contrast, with block-level removal, the loss of information could be compensated by neighboring blocks that serve similar functions.\n' +

In this study, we focus on network pruning [11], which has a long-standing reputation in the model compression field. Beyond its use in relatively small-scale convolutional networks [13, 14] and Transformer models [15, 16, 17], pruning has recently begun to be applied to contemporary LLMs. Several studies [15, 16] employ unstructured and semi-structured [1] pruning by zeroing individual neurons. SparseGPT [15] addresses the layer-wise reconstruction problem for pruning by computing Hessian inverses.

Despite the plausible performance of pruned models using zero masks, they necessitate specialized support for sparse matrix operations to ensure actual speedups.\n' +

      'By introducing a block pruning method, we conduct an in-depth comparative analysis on the impact of network width and depth on LLM compression. Our work involves the one-shot removal of Transformer blocks, determined by evaluating various design choices. Despite its simplicity, our method matches the zero-shot capabilities of recent width pruning techniques. Moreover, it offers significant inference speedups in resource-constrained scenarios that require running LLMs with limited batch sizes, where width pruning falls short. Future research will investigate more potent retraining methods, including full parameter updates and knowledge distillation, alongside an in-depth study of calibration data.\n' +
