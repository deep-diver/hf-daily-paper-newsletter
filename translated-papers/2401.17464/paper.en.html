      '\n' +
      'To achieve faithful reasoning that aligns with human expectations, large language models (LLMs) need to ground their reasoning to real-world knowledge (_e.g._, web facts, math and physical rules). Tools help LLMs access this external knowledge, but there remains challenges for fine-tuning LLM agents (_e.g._, Toolformer) to invoke tools in multi-step reasoning problems, where inter-connected tool calls require holistic and efficient tool usage planning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this work, we propose a new method for LLMs to better leverage tools in multi-step reasoning. Our method, Chain-of-Abstraction (CoA), trains LLMs to first decode reasoning chains with abstract placeholders, and then call domain tools to verify each reasoning chain by filling in specific knowledge. This planning with abstract chains enables LLMs to learn more general reasoning strategies, which are robust to shifts of domain knowledge (_e.g._, math results) relevant to different reasoning questions. It also allows LLMs to perform decoding and calling of external tools in parallel, which avoids the inference delay caused by waiting for tool responses. In mathematical reasoning and Wiki QA domains, we show that our method consistently outperforms previous chain-of-thought and tool-augmented baselines on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, with an average \\(\\sim 6\\%\\) absolute QA accuracy improvement. LLM agents trained with our method also show more efficient tool use, with inference speed being on average \\(\\sim\\)\\(1.4\\times\\) faster than baseline tool-augmented LLMs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recent large language models (LLMs; Touvron et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023), have made progress at interpreting and executing instructions (Wei et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022), but still make errors when recalling and composing world knowledge for their responses, _e.g._, making unfactual statements (Maynez et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2023), incorrect calculations (Patel et al., 2021), etc. Using auxiliary tools (_e.g._, a search engine to provide credible facts, a calculator for accurate math operations, etc.) at inference time can mitigate some of these errors, motivating tool-augmented language models that integrate external API calls into their output generations (Parisi et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, we show that current tool-augmented LLMs, _e.g._, Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023), struggle to reliably and efficiently leverage tools in multi-step reasoning. In particular, tool calls in multi-step reasoning tasks are often interleaved (_i.e._, the response of an API call is often part of the query of a subsequent call; as shown in Figure 1). Without explicitly modeling these interconnections\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: Overview of chain-of-abstraction reasoning with tools. Given a domain question (green scroll), a LLM is fine-tuned to first generate an abstract multi-step reasoning chain (blue bubble), and then call external tools to verify the chain with domain-specific knowledge (orange label). The final answer (yellow bubble) is obtained based on the reified chain of reasoning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'in reasoning chains, LLMs do not learn effective planning for tool use, which leads to less accurate reasoning with tools.1 Meanwhile, interleaving text generation with API calls also introduces inefficient inference "waiting times," where the model must wait for the response from the API call before resuming the decoding process. This inefficiency becomes more significant in multi-step reasoning scenarios, when multiple rounds of API calls are typically required for each reasoning process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: as verified by our analysis in §5\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this work, we propose **C**hain-**of-**A**bstraction **(CoA)** reasoning, a robust and efficient method for LLMs to perform multi-step reasoning with tools. As shown in Figure 1, LLMs are fine-tuned with a goal of making reasoning chains with abstract placeholders. The placeholders do not affect LLMs\' reasoning flow, and are subsequently infilled with specific knowledge retrieved from specialized tools, to ground the final answer generations. Planning abstract chain of reasoning encourages LLMs to inter-connect multiple tool calls and adopt more feasible reasoning strategies, which are robust to the variation of domain knowledge involved in each reasoning process, _e.g._, specific calculation results. Unlike previous methods where LLM decoding and API calls are executed in an interleaved manner, our method leverages tools to infill knowledge **once** after the whole chain of reasoning is generated. This enables more efficient decoding across multiple examples (_e.g._, as in a stream) because CoA traces for subsequent examples can be decoded while tool calls are made for the preceding ones, amortizing overall inference time. We develop a simple pipeline to build fine-tuning data for models to learn CoA, where we first prompt LLMs to re-write existing responses to instructions as abstract chains, and then use domain tools to check the validity of re-writing, as shown in Figure 2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'After training LLMs to learn CoA reasoning, we evaluate the finetuned models on two representative multi-step reasoning domains, including mathematical reasoning Cobbe et al. (2021); Miao et al. (2020); Patel et al. (2021); Koncel-Kedziorski et al. (2016), and Wikipedia (Wiki) QA Yang et al. (2018); Berant et al. (2013); Kwiatkowski et al. (2019); Joshi et al. (2017) that involves reasoning on factual descriptive knowledge. We show that our method boosts LLMs\' performances, with average \\(\\sim\\)\\(7.5\\%\\) and \\(4.5\\%\\) absolute accuracy improvements on math and Wiki QA, respectively. These improvements are consistent across both in-distribution and (zero-shot) out-of-distribution test sets, and are especially pronounced on questions that require complex chain-of-thought reasoning.2 Meanwhile, our method also uses tools more efficiently than previous augmentation methods, with average \\(\\sim\\)\\(1.47\\times\\) and \\(1.33\\times\\) faster inference speeds on math and Wiki QA tasks, respectively. Finally, extensive human evaluation demonstrates that our method guides LLMs to learn more accurate reasoning, which leads to \\(\\sim 8\\%\\) fewer reasoning errors.\n' +

      '## 2 Related Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Tool-Augmented LLMsThere has been a growing interest in augmenting LLMs using external tools. Considerable work has tried to adapt LLMs as tool-using reasoners through in-context learning, demonstrating promising performance improvements in various applications, _e.g._, math problem solving Gao et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2022), biomedical question answering Jin et al. (2023) and self-critiquing Gou et al. (2023). Nevertheless, guiding LLMs to effectively use tools using in-context demonstrations is challenging, which requires elaborate task-specific prompt engineering and is restricted by the model\'s instruction following ability Jacovi et al. (2023). Noticing the limitations of in-context learning, several works teach LLMs to learn the usage of tools by fine-tuning Parisi et al. (2022); Schick et al. (2023); Hao et al. (2023), which more robustly improves LLMs\' performance. However, all above approaches adopt sequential interactions with tools throughout reasoning, slowing the inference speed as a function of the latency of the tool (or API) and the number of API calls that are made.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Some other prior works focus on using LLMs for multi-step reasoning with other modules. In particular, ReAct Yao et al. (2023) and FireAct Chen et al. (2023) integrate LLMs with tools into a closed loop of thought, action and observation steps. This verbose reasoning loop slows down the LLM decoding, and still incorporates tools via sequential interactions, resulting in inefficient inference. Another line of work, PAL Gao et al. (2023) and Program of Thoughts Chen et al. (2022) prompt LLMs to generate program-based reasoning and interact with code executors, which however, heavily rely on closed source coding models, _i.e._, Codex Chen et al. (2021), and are restricted to pro cedural arithmetic reasoning. In our work, we aim to design a more general and efficient strategy for LLMs to leverage tools, especially on multi-step reasoning scenarios.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Tool Usage PlanningSeveral previous work research the planning of tool usage in LLMs. Specifically, HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), Chameleon (Lu et al., 2023), OpenAGI (Ge et al., 2023) and MetaTool (Huang et al., 2023) focus on planning the high-level sequence of using multiple tools to address multi-domain mixed tasks. Similarly, LATM (Cai et al., 2023), ML-BENCH (Liu et al., 2023) and Gorilla (Patil et al., 2023) aim at planning program-level integration of multiple APIs for designing scripts of procedural tasks, _e.g._, a script for training a model described by a GitHub repository. ToolChain* (Zhuang et al., 2023) combines the planning of tool usage with tree-search-based reasoning (Yao et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023), which is especially useful for procedural tasks (Xu et al., 2023; Cobbe et al., 2021). Different from above work, we focus on the planning of general chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) reasoning with awareness of domain specialized tools.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Method\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Chain-of-Abstraction (CoA) ReasoningOur method decouples the general reasoning of LLMs from domain-specific knowledge obtained from external tools. Figure 1 shows an overview of our method. In particular, we first fine-tune LLMs to generate reasoning chains with abstract placeholders, _e.g._, \\(y1\\), \\(y2\\) and \\(y3\\),3 as shown in Figure 1. In the second stage, we reify each reasoning chain by replacing placeholders with domain-specific knowledge obtained from external tools, _e.g._, calculation results from a calculator, relevant articles retrieved from web search engine, etc. Finally, the question is answered based on the reified reasoning chain.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: We also test placeholders in single-character format, _e.g._, \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\), which however leads to sub-optimal results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Note that since the LLMs are trained to generate abstract chain of reasoning instead of regular chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with explicit values, this enables LLMs to focus on learning general and holistic reasoning strategies without needing to generate instance-specific knowledge for the model\'s parameters. Moreover, decoupling general reasoning and domain-specific knowledge enables LLM decoding to proceed and switch between different samples in parallel with API calling (via a pipeline), _i.e._, LLM can start generating the next abstract chain while the tool fills the current chain, which speeds up the overall inference process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fine-tuning Data ConstructionTo construct chain-of-abstraction (CoA) data for fine-tuning LLMs, we collect question answering (QA) samples from existing open-source QA datasets (Cobbe et al., 2021; Miao et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018), and prompt LLMa-70B (Touvron et al., 2023) to re-write the answer of each sampled question, as shown in Figure 2. Specifically, we prompt LLMa-70B to label the spans in gold answers that correspond to knowledge operations (_e.g._, math derivations, statements based on Wikipedia references) and then to re-write the sentences with labeled spans as fillable CoA traces, where the operation results are replaced with abstract placeholders.4 For example, the two derivations in the example in Figure 2 are re-written as "[\\(20+35=y1\\)]" and "[\\(90-y1=y2\\)]", respectively.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 4: We provide our few-shot prompting examples for CoA data re-writing in Appendix C.\n' +

To ensure that the re-written data is accurate, we use domain-specialized tools to verify the correctness of each CoA reasoning trace.5 Specifically, we use the tools to execute the labeled operations in each CoA, and only keep questions whose CoA can be infilled with valid results by the tools.\n' +

      'Given a math question, the QA system needs to generate a natural language solution to the problem with step-by-step arithmetic derivations (as demonstrated in the left column of Figure 1). We assume that the derivations involved in the solution are the specialized knowledge operations required in this domain, which are labeled in square brackets with derivation results being replaced by abstract placeholders, e.g., "\\([20+35=y1]\\)".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'DatasetsWe construct most of our fine-tuning CoA data by re-writing the GSM8K Cobbe et al. (2021) training set, which contains 7473 linguistically diverse grade school math problems. As GSM8K dataset focuses on multi-step reasoning, it lacks coverage of single-step arithmetic problems, so we also re-write an additional set of 691 single-step math problems from the ASDiv Miao et al. (2020) dataset. Across these re-written datasets, we find that \\(\\sim 76.6\\%\\) of the CoA reasoning traces generated by LLaMa-70B are verified by our equation solver (described below). Table 1 shows the reasoning step distribution (_i.e._, number of derivations) of our constructed fine-tuning data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For an in-distribution evaluation, we test models on GSM8K and ASDiv, containing 1319 and 2305 testing problems. To further test the models\' generalization ability, we also conduct zero-shot evaluation on other representative math datasets, including SVAMP Patel et al. (2021) and MAWPS Koncel-Kedziorski et al.

      '\n' +
      'Domain ToolWe use an equation solver to perform the arithmetic derivations required in the math domain. Our equation solver first extracts the derivations labeled in the CoA reasoning, e.g., "\\([20+35=y1]\\)" and "\\([90-y1=y2]\\)", and combines all derivations into a system of equations. Then the system of equations is solved by the SymPy toolkit,7 to get the true value of each variable (_i.e._, the value of the abstract placeholder). Finally, our equation solver returns the reified chain of reasoning by replacing all the variables with their solved true values (including the answer).\n' +

Among the 90447 training QA pairs, we identify 72991 as **Bridge** QA pairs, where an intermediate entity must be identified to link the answer to the question, as shown in Table 2. The remaining 17456 are **Comparison** QA pairs, where the attributes of two entities are compared, _e.g._, "Are Randal Kleiser and Kyle Schickner of the same nationality?". We prompt LLaMa-70B to re-write these training QAs into CoAs with WikiSearch and NER queries, and verify each CoA with our domain tools (described below), by checking whether all the articles returned by the WikiSearch queries match one of the titles in the gold articles. Finally, 8956 Bridge QAs and 5405 Comparison QAs are selected as fine-tuning data.10 For Wiki QA, we note that besides training a LLM to produce CoA data using WikiSearch, we also fine-tune a second LLM to learn to generate the final gold answer based on a correctly reified CoA reasoning trace.\n' +

We also observe that CoA performs better than Toolformer - Math, confirming that the introduction of abstract variables enables more robust tool use compared to direct integration of API calls within chain-of-thought reasoning.\n' +

We find that CoA (no Tool) performs consistently worse than CoA across all datasets, confirming that using specialized tools enables LLM agents to conduct more precise operations, rather than directly solving the same operations. However, we find that CoA (no Tool) still outperforms all baseline methods on zero-shot generalization to SVAMP and MAWPS datasets, implying that chain-of-abstraction reasoning also contributes to better robustness of CoA, perhaps due to better planning of multiple reasoning steps indexed by abstract variables.\n' +

Compared to the few-shot CoT-FSP, CoA produces reasoning chains that more often match the length of the gold reasoning chains, as reflected by the heat-map statistics (left column) being more aggregated around the diagonal (comparable to CoT-FT). At the same time, we observe that models achieve better QA accuracy when the number of reasoning steps in their generated answers are aligned with the gold references (_i.e._, the diagonal of heat-maps in right column). All above results show that fine-tuned models are better at learning to produce reasoning chains that\n' +

      'Interestingly, we find that CoA, compared to CoT-FT, achieves higher performance especially on questions that require more reasoning steps. In the right column of Figure 3, CoA\'s improvement over CoT-FT is more pronounced on questions with more than \\(3\\) steps in the gold reasoning chain (highlighted with red squares). We also present overall accuracy scores on GSM8K subsets according to varying numbers of gold reasoning steps in Table 5, where we confirm this result, indicating that the model trained with CoA has more robust long chain-of-thought reasoning capability, which is enabled from learning to plan using abstractions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Human EvaluationTo more comprehensively verify that CoA improves both knowledge operation (_i.e._, arithmetic by using tools) and reasoning accuracy, we conduct a human evaluation on different model answers to 200 randomly sampled GSM8K test questions. Specifically, given a GSM8K question and a model\'s answer to the question, we ask human workers to judge whether the answer contains any arithmetic errors (_e.g._, wrong calculations, invalid equations) or reasoning errors unrelated to math derivations (_e.g._, misunderstanding of the question, improper strategy for solving the question), and report how often the model makes these two kinds of errors. In Table 6, we find that CoA effectively reduces arithmetic errors to zero, due to the use of equation solver to perform accurate calculations. More importantly, our method also makes fewer reasoning errors compared to the baselines, verifying that CoA fine-tuning guides the model to learn more accurate reasoning through the holistic planning of abstract reasoning chains. By contrast, ordinary fine-tuning (_i.e._, CoT-FT) produces a more limited reasoning improvement compared to the few-shot CoT-FSP, while also failing to suppress arithmetic errors.\n' +

      'Inference EfficiencyImportantly, we find that the performance benefits of CoA reasoning do not come with increased computational costs. In Figure 4, we show the average time (seconds) that CoA and baseline agents (seeded with LLaMa-2-Chat-7B) needs to answer a question _w.r.t._ a varying number of gold reasoning steps. Compared to the CoT baselines, CoA requires less time than the few-shot baseline CoT-FSP, whose generation needs to be conditioned on additional examples. However, CoA is slightly less inference-efficient compared to CoT-FT, likely due to the decoding of additional tokens (_e.g._, "[" and "]") for the abstract statements.\n' +

      'flatter inference time curve, indicating better scaling as the number of reasoning steps increases. This difference arises because CoA decouples the generation of (abstract) reasoning chains from the retrieval of knowledge (_i.e._, tool use), allowing full reasoning chains to be decoded before any tool is called. This procedure amortizes inference costs in two ways. First, tool calls are made after the CoA trace has been decoded, enabling parallel tool calls for the same trace (_e.g._, using an equation solver once rather than multiple calls to a calculator), and avoiding the time delay caused by waiting for external API responses. Consequently, the model fine-tuned with CoA is more efficient at multi-step reasoning, especially when the number of reasoning steps (_i.e._, tool calls) increases. Second, across multiple examples, the model can generate the CoA trace of the next example while tool calls are made for the preceding one, parallelizing CoA decoding and tools calls across examples.\n' +

In particular, CoA outperforms CoT-FSP, CoT-FT, Toolformer and Toolformer - Wiki on the more challenging bridge-type QAs, where two steps of reasoning over Wikipedia knowledge are _consecutively_ entangled, _i.e._, cannot be performed independently in parallel as in comparison-type QAs.

      '\n' +
      'In this work, we propose to decouple the general reasoning ability of LLM agents from executing specialized knowledge via external tools. Our method, chain-of-abstraction (CoA), encourages LLMs to learn the planning of abstract multi-step reasoning, which are more robust to out-of-distribution knowledge shifts. CoA also achieves a more efficient pipeline for tool usage that significantly improves the speed of tool-augmented multi-step reasoning. The simple, yet effective, implementations of our method on two diverse tasks (_i.e._, mathematical reasoning and open-domain QA) demonstrate its potential for being adapted to new reasoning scenarios.\n' +

      'Evaluation DetailsFor mathematical reasoning evaluation, we extract the last number appeared in each model\'s answer, and check whether the number exactly match the gold reference. The accuracy is reported as the rate of such exact match across all QAs in a test set. For Wiki QA evaluation, similar to mathematical reasoning, we extract the final answer of each model and calculate its exact match rate to the gold reference. Specifically, the final answer is supposed to be the words after "Action: finish[" for FireAct baseline, and words after "The answer is " for other models. Our 8-shot in-domain examples used for the CoT-FSP baseline are shown in Table 13 and 14, which enables the model to provide answer with our required format for evaluation, _i.e._, stating its final answer after "The answer is ". Our human evaluation on GSM8K is conducted by 5 internal domain experts from our research group. For each math question, we provide the experts with the gold answer as reference, and ask them to evaluate each model answer in anonymous manner, _i.e._, experts do not know which model each answer comes from. Two yes-or-no questions are asked for evaluating each model answer, including: a) whether the answer has any arithmetic error, and b) whether the answer has any reasoning error, and binary choices from the experts are collected to calculate the error rates of each model\'s generation. We present our detailed instructions for human evaluation in Figure 5.\n' +

      'Model TrainingWe fine-tune our models with batch size \\(8\\) and learning rate \\(2e^{-5}\\) and \\(1e^{-5}\\) for 7B and 70B model sizes, respectively, using cosine learning rate scheduler with warm-up step \\(10\\). We use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2018) optimizer for all our fine-tuning experiments, with \\(\\beta_{1}\\), \\(\\beta_{2}\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) set to \\(0.9\\), \\(0.95\\) and \\(1e^{-8}\\), respectively. Training weight decay is set to \\(0.1\\). For mathematical reasoning, we use a total of \\(400\\) training steps, and get the best model checkpoints (with highest validation scores) at step \\(240\\) and \\(200\\) for 7B and 70B model sizes. For Wiki QA domain, we adjust the total training steps to \\(500\\), and get the best checkpoints at step \\(450\\) and \\(300\\) for 7B and 70B models. Therefore, only \\(\\sim\\)2K and \\(\\sim\\)3K QAs are required in practice for fine-tuning our models in math and Wiki QA domains. The training of our 7B and 70B models is based on 8 and 64 NVIDIA A100-SXM4 (80GB) GPUs, respectively.\n' +

      'Specifically, we consider **two types of errors**: 1) **arithmetic error; 2) reasoning error**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Whether the answer has any **arithmetic error?** i.e., math derivations are wrongly calculated, or math equations do not hold. Choose Yes or No. For example:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Question**: A pirate crew is digging for buried treasure on the island marked X on a map. They dug ten holes the first day, thirteen holes the second day, and eight holes the third day. They stopped digging early on the third day to fill in two holes the pirates kept falling in. How many holes are now on the island?\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Candidate answer**: On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes. On the second day, they dug 13 holes. On the third day, they dug 8 holes, and filled in 2 holes, so there are 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 27 holes. The answer is 27.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Analysis**: Yes, the answer has an arithmetic error, where 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 should be 29.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '2. Whether the answer has any **reasoning error?** i.e., misunderstanding of the question, or having a wrong problem solving strategy, which is unrelated to arithmetic correctness. Choose Yes or No. For example:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Question**: Marcus is half of Leo\'s age and five years younger than Deanna. Deanna is 26. How old is Leo?\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Candidate answer**: Marcus is half of Leo\'s age. So Marcus is 26 / 2 = 13 years old. Leo is 13 + 5 = 18 years old. The answer is 18.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Analysis**: Yes, the answer has a reasoning error, Leo should be (26 - 5) * 2 = 42 years old.\n' +

      '1. Please forgive any grammar or spelling typos in all questions and answers, they are not considered as math solution errors.\n' +

      '2. If you feel the gold reference answer (Gold_Answer) is wrong, just ignore it and make the judgment based on your own answer to the question.\n' +
