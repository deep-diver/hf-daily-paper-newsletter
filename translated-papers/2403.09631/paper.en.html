      '\n' +
      'Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration with the broader realm of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, they perform action prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. In contrast, human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future scenarios to plan actions accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top of a 3D-based large language model (LLM), and a set of interaction tokens is introduced to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities into the model, we train a series of embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM for predicting the goal images and point clouds. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodal generation, and planning capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Nowadays, there has been a proliferation of vision-language models (Liu et al., 2023; Alayrac et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b) that can take images as inputs and perform a series of reasoning tasks in the 2D space, mirroring the versatility of the human brain. Such 2D foundation models also lay the foundation for recent embodied foundation models such as RT-2 (Brohan et al., 2023) and PALM-E (Driess et al., 2023a) that could generate high-level plans or low-level actions contingent on the images. However, they neglect the fact that human beings are situated within a far richer 3D physical world beyond 2D images - they reason, plan, and act based on their 3D understanding of the environment (Palmer, 1975; Pylyshyn, 2003; Marr, 2010). It\'s crucial that human-like intelligent embodied agents are equipped with the same 3D understanding ability.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Taking a step forward, recent works (Huang et al., 2023b; Hong et al., 2024) develop embodied foundation models that could plan and act in the 3D environment. However, such models mainly learn a direct mapping from perception to action, devoid of a broader understanding of the dynamics of the world, and the relations between actions and world dynamics. On the other hand, human beings are blessed with world models that simulate future events based on 3D internal representations. By depicting the imagination and anticipation about the future states, one could better plan actions toward the predicted goals.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Challenges inevitably exist for building such human-like 3D world models. Firstly, existing foundation models focus on language generation, unable to imagine modalities beyond language and simulate future states to facilitate action generation, which is a crucial aspect of world models. Secondly, existing embodied datasets mainly contain 2D images or videos, lacking 3D-related annotations for reasoning and planning in the 3D space.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning, and action through a generative world model. Specifically, we build our 3D-VLA on top of a 3D large language model (Hong et al., 2023) to equip the model with 3D understanding ability. Since embodied tasks could not be accomplished via language generation solely and require deeper digging into the dynamic scenes, the manipulated objects as well as actions to interact with the scenes, we add special interactive tokens to the LLM vocabulary (_e.g.,_ scene, object, and action tokens). Theseadded tokens enable our model to perform a wider range of embodied tasks and support interleaved 3D-text data. Recognizing the inadequacy of multimodal generation ability in embodied foundation models, we propose to inject the goal generation ability into 3D-VLA. We first pretrain a set of embodied diffusion models for RGBD-to-RGBD and point-to-point generation respectively. To efficiently bridge between the diffusion decoders of various modalities and the LLM embedding space, we employ a projector that aligns multi-modal goal generation in 3D-VLA. It strategically incorporates multimodal signals to specify the type of modality for a generation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Another challenge for building such a generative world model lies in the lack of data. The embodied datasets in use (Padalkar et al., 2023; Brohan et al., 2022; Jang et al., 2022) mainly consist of 2D images, deficient in 3D-related information. Thus, we curate a large-scale 3D embodied instruction tuning dataset. Specifically, we first gather a diverse collection of datasets that includes real and synthetic data featuring robot manipulations and human-object interactions. For datasets lacking depth data, we utilize a depth estimator to append necessary 3D details and project them to 3D point clouds. Additionally, we design a pipeline to use the off-the-shelf models to extract 3D-related annotations and enrich the language descriptions. In this way, we collect 2M 3D-language-action data pairs, covering various tasks such as task captioning, action prediction, localization, multimodal goal generation, etc, as shown in Figure 1.\n' +

      'To sum up, we have the following contributions:\n' +

      '* We propose 3D-VLA, a new family of 3D vision-language-action embodied foundation models that unify 3D perception, reasoning, and action with a generative world model.\n' +

      '* Our 3D-VLA can conduct a series of tasks, including goal generation (in terms of images, depths, and point clouds), goal-based planning, and embodiment action prediction.

      '\n' +
      '**Multimodal Language Models** Recent Multimodal Language Models have made remarkable advances in various domains, including vision and language understanding (Li et al., 2022, 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023), interleaved image and text understanding (Alayrac et al., 2022), interleaved image and text generation (Dong et al., 2023). Some more unified models can perceive inputs and generate outputs in arbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio (Wu et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023). However, none of these models can perceive 3D inputs or output actions according to 3D input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Vision-Language-Action Models** Previous vision-language models with action output have predominantly leveraged 2D features, thereby lacking the capability of 3D spatial understanding (Driess et al., 2023; Brohan et al., 2022; 2023). In contrast, our model is guided by 3D features, which are predicted in alignment with goal objectives in our general world model. We are the first to leverage 3D features such as point clouds for action token generation, significantly improving action planning accuracy. Additionally, this pipeline possesses the potential to be extended for applications in real-world scenarios.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**3D Foundation Models** Our paper is closely related to the 3D foundation models that integrate 3D features in MLLMs (Hong et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). These studies have successfully stepped forward to leverage foundation models to comprehend 3D features. However, they primarily focus on analyzing and reasoning in the current observable state of the 3D scenes, thereby revealing a limitation in predicting future features that extend beyond immediate perception. Contrasting with them, we aim to not only understand the perceivable scenes but also predict imperceptible multimodal features guided by specific goals. This capability enables our model to further generate action tokens to interact with the 3D world.\n' +

      '## 3 3D Embodied Instruction Tuning Dataset\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recently, benefiting from billion-scale datasets on the internet, VLMs have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in various tasks. Similarly, million-level datasets comprising video-action pairs lay the foundation for embodied VLMs for robot control. However, they mostly don\'t provide depth or 3D annotations and precise control in robot operations that necessitate the inclusion of 3D spatial reasoning and interaction. Without 3D information, it is challenging for a robot to comprehend and execute the commands that require 3D spatial reasoning, such as "place the farthest cup into the middle drawer".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To bridge this gap, we build a large-scale 3D embodied instruction tuning dataset that provides sufficient 3D-related information as well as paired text instructions to train our\n' +

      'Figure 2: Overview of our 3D-VLA pipeline. The left part shows our goal-generation capability. Our model can imagine the final state image and point cloud based on the user’s input. This generated goal state can then be fed back to our model to guide the robot control.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'model. We design a pipeline to extract 3D-language-action pairs from existing embodied datasets, obtaining annotations for point clouds, depth maps, 3D bounding boxes, the robot\'s 7D actions, and textual descriptions. The details are outlined as follows.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Dataset Collection\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our data are curated from various sources. We provide an overview here, with details available in the Appendix:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Robot Datasets:** We select 12 datasets (Brohan et al., 2022; Jang et al., 2022; Walke et al., 2023; Lynch et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Dass et al., 2023; Mandlekar et al., 2019; Mees et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Sawhney et al., 2021; Sermanet et al., 2023) from the Open-X Embodiment Dataset (Padalkar et al., 2023). They have high-quality images with linguistic instructions in the real world but lack more in-depth information and 3D annotations. We also select datasets with excellent depth information, such as Dobb-E (Shafiullah et al., 2023) and RH20T (Fang et al., 2023). Additionally, we use datasets collected from two simulator environments, RLBench (James et al., 2020) and CALVIN (Mees et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Human Object Interaction Datasets**: Human/hand-object interactions could provide demonstrations that benefit robot decision-making and imitation. Therefore, we utilize several human-object interaction datasets, including datasets without depth information, such as Epic-Kitchens (Damen et al., 2018), and datasets with better 3D annotations, such as HOI4D (Liu et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Visual Annotations\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Estimating depths and optical flows.** Given that over 95% of the video datasets for embodied tasks do not provide 3D information, we employ ZoeDepth (Bhat et al., 2023) on each frame of the video from these datasets. Additionally, to better utilize video data, we use RAFT (Teed & Deng, 2020) for optical flow estimation. Optical flow aids in refining the data we generate. Thus, for video segments where the camera pose does not change, we use optical flow to estimate which pixels are the unmoved background. We align the depth maps of these backgrounds across different frames of the same video, multiplying each frame\'s depth map by a coefficient to ensure depth consistency. After getting the depth maps, we can directly lift the RGB-D images into 3D point clouds using camera intrinsics and poses.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Generating 3D annotations.** We aim to generate several 3D-related annotations: 3D bounding boxes of the objects, goal images, depths, or point clouds as the imagination outcomes, as well as robot actions in the 3D space. We first extract the 3D bounding boxes of the objects in the scenes. Such information could benefit 3D models\' ability to capture 3D information and attend to the manipulated object for better decision-making. The embodied datasets that serve as sources provide text instructions to describe the commands executed by the robots. We use spaCy (Honnibal & Montani, 2017) to parse the instructions to obtain all noun chunks, including the manipulated object. We utilize a pre-trained grounding model (e.g., Grounded-SAM (Ren et al., 2024) ) to obtain the 2D mask of each object. These 2D masks, when lifted to 3D, correspond to parts of the point cloud, allowing us to obtain the 3D bounding boxes of all the objects in space. When selecting masks, the manipulated object is chosen based on the highest confidence value in areas of significant optical flow. Since we reconstruct the depths and point clouds, we could use images, depths, and point clouds in future frames as ground-truth goals. For actions, we use the 7 DoF actions from the provided datasets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Language Annotations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Inspired by (Li et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023), we propose to generate dense language annotations consisting of tokens (_e.g._, <image>/image>; <pcd>/pcd>) that encompass the 3D annotations (bounding boxes, goal images / depths / point clouds, actions) we generated before, as shown in the prompts in Figure 2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We use pre-defined language templates with tokens to construct these 3D annotations into prompts and answers. Following (Hong et al., 2023), we use ChatGPT-based prompting to diversify prompts. Specifically, we provide instructions to ChatGPT, as well as our annotated objects and bounding boxes. We also give 2-3 few-shot human-written demonstrations to guide the GPT on the type of data it is instructed to generate. ChatGPT is asked to summarize the information and rewrite the template-generated prompts into more diverse forms. For tasks without pre-defined templates, ChatGPT is also asked to generate prompts and answers as language inputs and outputs of these tasks by itself. We show the detailed templates and prompts to generate all types of data in the Appendix.\n' +

      '## 4 Methods\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Overview\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we introduce 3D-VLA, a world model for 3D reasoning, goal generation, and decision-making in embodied environments. As shown in Figure 2, we first build our backbone on top of 3D-LLM (Hong et al., 2023), and further enhance the model\'s capabilities to interact with the 3D world by adding a series of interaction tokens. Next, we inject goal generation ability into 3D-VLA by first pre-training the embodied diffusion models and employing a projector for aligning the LLM and the diffusion models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### 3D-VLA\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.2.1 Backbone\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the first stage, we develop the 3D-VLA base model following the methodology of 3D-LLM (Hong et al., 2023). Since the dataset we collected is not at the billion-level scale required for training a multi-modal LLM from scratch, we follow the approach of 3D-LLM by leveraging multi-view features to generate 3D scene features. This enables the seamless integration of visual features into a pre-trained VLM with no need for adaptation. Meanwhile, the training datasets for 3D-LLM mostly comprise objects (Deitke et al., 2022) and indoor scenes (Dai et al., 2017; Ramakrishnan et al., 2021), which do not directly align with our embodied setup. Therefore, we choose not to load the 3D-LLM pretrained model. Instead, we utilize BLIP2-FlanT5XL (Li et al., 2023) as our pretrained model. During training, we unfreeze both the input and output embeddings for tokens, as well as the weights of the Q-Former.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.2.2 Interaction Tokens\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To enhance the model\'s comprehension of 3D scenes and facilitate interaction within these environments, we introduce a novel set of interaction tokens. Firstly, We incorporate object tokens <obj> </obj> that enclose the object nouns in the parsed sentences (_e.g._, <obj> a chocolate bar </obj> [loc tokens] on the table) so that the model could better capture which objects are manipulated or referred to. Secondly, to better represent spatial information by language, we devise a set of location tokens <loc0-255> for grounding referred objects, which are represented by six tokens for the 3D bounding box in the form of AABB. Thirdly, to better encode dynamics with our framework, we introduce the <scene> </scene> tokens to enclose the embeddings of a static scene. By composing over the scene tokens, 3D-VLA could comprehend dynamic scenes and manage inputs that interleave 3D scenes and text.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We further enhance the architecture with an expanded set of specialized tokens that represent robotic actions. The robot\'s actions, with 7 degrees of freedom, are represented by discrete tokens such as <aloc0-255>, <arot0-255>, and <gripper0/1> to denote the arm\'s intended absolute location, rotation, gripper openness. These actions are separated by token <ACT_SEP>.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Injecting Goal Generation Ability into 3D-VLA\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we introduce how our 3D-VLA performs goal generation in terms of images, depths, and point clouds.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Human beings pre-visualize the final states of the scenes to facilitate action prediction or decision making, which is a key aspect in building world models. Moreover, during preliminary experiments, we also discover that providing the ground-truth final states can enhance the model\'s reasoning and planning capabilities. However, training an MLLM to generate images, depths, and point clouds is non-trivial. Firstly, state-of-the-art video diffusion models are not tailored for embodied setups. For instance, when asking Runway (Esser et al., 2023) to generate future frames given the instruction "open the drawer", the entire scene is altered to a great extent with regard to view change, unexpected object deformation, and weird texture replacement, as well as layout distortion. Similarly, using the method of DreamLLM (Dong et al., 2023) to directly freeze the stable diffusion trained on internet data, can lead to collapsed outputs. Secondly, how to incorporate diffusion models of various modalities into a single foundation model remains a challenge. Therefore, we propose to inject the ability to generate images, depths and point clouds into 3D-VLA. We first pretrain the embodied diffusion models in terms of different modalities such as images, depths and point clouds, and then align the decoders of these diffusion models to the embedding space of 3D-VLA through an alignment stage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.3.1 Pretraining Embodied Diffusion Models for Goal Generation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To address the limitations of current diffusion models for goal generation in an embodied environment, we train RGB-D to RGB-D and point-cloud to point-cloud diffusion models. We utilize our curated 3D-language video data to train a conditional diffusion model that edits the initial state modality based on instructions to generate the corresponding final state modality. The specific training details for these models are as follows: For RGBD to RGBD generation, we employ Stable Diffusion V1.4 (Rombach et al., 2022) as our pretrained model due to the efficiency and quality of image generation by latent diffusion when operating in the latent space of a pretrained VAE (Kingma and Welling, 2013). We concatenate the RGB latent and depth latent as the image condition. Similarly, for point-to-point generation, we use Point-E (Nichol et al., 2022) as the pretrained model, to which we add a point cloud condition input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.3.2 Bridging LLM and Goal Generation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'After pretraining the diffusion models, we are equipped with various decoders that could generate goals by conditioning the latent spaces in their modalities. Challenges remain as to how to seamlessly incorporate the pretrained decoders into the LLMs so that 3D-VLA could generate goals with regard to any pretrained modalities conditioned on the input instructions. To bridge the gap between the LLM and the diffusion models of different modalities, we develop an alignment stage into our 3D-VLA. We first introduce additional special tokens such as <image> </image> and <pcdb</pcdb>. These tokens are intricately designed to inform the decoder about the type ofmodal content to output. Between the enclosing tokens, we supervise the LLM in generating instructions for a robot to execute, which may include object tokens and location tokens, such as <image> pick up the <obj> apple </obj> [loc tokens] </image>. Based on this, we can apply a transformer-based projector, which is capable of mapping the decoder features and embeddings from the Large Language Model (LLM) into the space of the DM framework. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the model\'s capability to understand and generate multi-modal data, establishing a connection between high-level language understanding and multi-modal goal generation. To make training 3D-VLA more efficient and to avoid catastrophic forgetting, we utilize LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) to fine-tune different diffusion models. At the same time, we only train the newly introduced special tokens embeddings, the corresponding embedding output linear layer, and the entire projector. We minimize both the LLM and DM denoising loss.\n' +

      '3D-VLA is a versatile 3D-based generative world model that can perform reasoning and grounding in the 3D world, imagine multi-modal goal content, and generate actions for robot manipulation. In this section, we evaluate 3D-VLA in three aspects: 3D reasoning and localization, multi-modal goal generation, and embodied action planning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### 3D Reasoning and Localization\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Tasks.** Our primary focus is on scenes involving robots that are characterized by greater dynamism and a higher degree of interaction, which require a greater level of reasoning and localization abilities. We build several tasks on 3D embodied instruction tuning datasets for learning these abilities in the robotics domain. The tasks include 1) embodied QA on RoboVQA dataset (Sermanet et al., 2023); 2) task captioning on 11 Open-X datasets (Padalkar et al., 2023), where we input the initial and final scenes and ask the agent to reason what has happened; 3) what-if QA on RT-1 dataset (Brohan et al., 2022), where the agent is asked a question that what will happen if some specified actions (represented by action tokens) are executed; 4) dense captioning on 11 Open-X datasets, where the agent need to caption the content specified by a 3d bounding box; 5) localization on 11 Open-X datasets, where the agent is to localize the object mentioned in the robot manipulation instruction. We evaluate 3D-VLA on these tasks using held-in datasets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Baselines.** We compare 3D-VLA with 3D-LLM (Hong et al., 2023) and 2D vision-language models, including BLIP2 (Li et al., 2023), OpenFlamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), and LLAVA (Liu et al., 2023). We implement these baselines in two ways: 1) zero-shot transfer where we test the released trained model on these new tasks; 2) held-in evaluation where we train the released model on 2D-image-action-language pairs (_i.e.,_, 11 datasets selected from Open\n' +

      'X and RoboVQA dataset). For the localization task, we compare with 2D grounding MLLM, namely Kosmos-2 (Peng et al., 2023) and CoVLM (Li et al., 2023a). Specifically, we use these models to detect 2D bounding boxes in a zero-shot manner and then transfer them to 3D bounding boxes using depth projection.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Result analysis.** In Tables 1, 3D-VLA outperforms all 2D VLM methods on language reasoning tasks. We attribute it to the leverage of 3D information, which provides more accurate spatial information for reasoning. Besides, since our dataset contains a bunch of 3D localization annotations, 3D-VLA learns to localize the relevant objects, which helps the model focus more on key objects for reasoning. Moreover, we find that 3D-LLM performs poorly on these robotic reasoning tasks, which demonstrates the necessity of collecting and training on a robotics-related 3D dataset. In Table 2, 3D-VLA demonstrates a marked superiority over the 2D baseline methods in terms of localization performance. This finding serves as compelling evidence of the efficacy of our annotation process, which supplies a substantial quantity of 3D annotations, thereby facilitating the acquisition of robust 3D localization capabilities within our model.\n' +

      '### Multi-modal Goal Generation\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Tasks.** We quantitatively evaluate the RGB goal and point cloud goal generation capability of 3D-VLA on Open-X test sets. We randomly sample 4000 episodes from the Open-X test set which 3D-VLA does not see in the training process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Baselines.** For image generation, we compare 3D-VLA with three types of image generation methods: 1) image-editing methods Instruct-P2P (Brooks et al., 2023); 2) goal image/video generation methods SuSIE (Black et al., 2023); 3) LLMs with image generation ability NeXT-GPT (Wu et al., 2023). For point cloud generation, we compare with text-to-3D diffusion model Point-E (Nichol et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Qualitative results.** The image goal generation results are shown in Table 3. When compared with the existing generation methods that directly zero-shot transfers to the robotics domain (rows 1, 2, 3 in Table 3), 3D-VLA achieves a promising performance in terms of most metrics. This underscores the importance of training a world model using datasets specifically designed for robotics applications. Even in a direct comparison with Instruct-P2P*, which was trained on the same robotics datasets we employed (row 4 in the table), 3D-VLA consistently outperforms it. This highlights that the integration of a large language model into 3D-VLA results in a more comprehensive and insightful comprehension of robotics manipulation instructions, leading to better goal image generation performance. Furthermore, when we exclude the predicted bounding box from the input prompt (row 5), we observe a slight decrease in performance. This observation confirms the effectiveness of using these intermediate predicted bounding boxes as they assist the model in comprehending the overall scene, allowing the model to allocate more attention to the specific object mentioned in the given instruction, ultimately enhancing its ability to imagine the final goal images.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The point cloud generation results are presented in Table 4. 3D-VLA with intermediate predicted bounding boxes performs the best. This outcome reinforces the significance of incorporating large language models and precise object localization in the context of comprehending both the instruction and the scene.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Quantitative results.** In the first row of Figure 3, we visualize the generated RGB-D goal images on the test set of RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022) and Jaco Play (Dass et al., 2023) datasets. These samples are not seen in the training process. Given the initial scenes and instructions, the 3D-VLA model consistently exhibits the capability to maintain the background elements unchanged while accurately identifying the target object of interaction and correctly modifying the states of these identified objects following the provided instructions. The generated RGB-D goal images closely align both in terms of visual appearance and semantic content with the ground truth goal. In addition to our controlled experimental settings, we extended our testing to encompass scenes captured from the internet or everyday life. In these diverse and uncontrolled environments, our 3D-VLA model consistently and robustly demonstrated its efficacy.\n' +

      '### Embodied Action Planning\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Tasks** We evaluate the ability of 3D-VLA for robot arm action prediction on two benchmarks, namely RLBench (James et al., 2020) and CALVIN (Mees et al., 2022). We select three tasks from RLBench for evaluation. Besides, we also select var1 from the pick-up-cup task as an unseen task to test the model\'s generalization ability. For CALVIN,\n' +

Additionally, our generalization capability is proven in the pick-up-cup task. In Table 6, 3D-VLA also achieves promising results in CALVIN. We attribute the superiority to the ability to localize the objects of interest and imagine the goal state, which provides rich information for inferring actions.\n' +

      '## 6 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we introduce 3D-VLA, a generative world model that can reason, understand, generate, and plan in the embodied environment. We devise a novel data generation pipeline to construct a dataset including 2M 3D-Language-action data pairs to train our model. These data enable it to perform diverse tasks such as task caption, localization, goal image/point cloud generation, action prediction, etc. Our model uses 3D-LLM as the backbone and introduces interaction tokens to interact with the environment. We train a image to image and point to point diffusion model for embodied AI. They are further aligned by a projector with the LLM to enhance the LLM\'s multimodal generation capabilities. The experiment further shows that our 3D-VLA has stronger capabilities in embodied tasks than the 2D baseline.\n' +

      '## Impact Statement\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This paper introduces research aimed at pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning in the realm of robot manipulation. Given that robots operate in the physical world, the potential for collisions with objects and humans arises when the robot system is not adequately configured. To mitigate this issue, our approach involves initial training in a simulator environment followed by real-world deployment under human supervision, to minimize any adverse impacts.\n' +
