      'The BigCode project,1 an open-scientific collaboration focused on the responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs), introduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH),2 we build The Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive. Alongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, we carefully select other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle notebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4\\(\\times\\) larger than the first StarCoder dataset. We train StarCoder2 models with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate them on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks.\n' +

      'We find that our small model, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most benchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. Our large model, StarCoder2-15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In addition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its size. Although DeepSeeKorder-33B is the best-performing model at code completion for high-resource languages, we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms it on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource languages. We make the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and ensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare Heritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the source code data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs; Chen et al., 2021; Nijkamp et al., 2023; Roziere et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024) have rapidly emerged as powerful assistants for writing and editing code. As of January 30, 2024, GitHub CoPilot has garnered over 1.3 million paying subscribers, with over 50,000 organisations opting for the enterprise version (MSFT Q2 Earning Call, 2024), estimated to increase developer productivity by up to 56% as well as developer satisfaction (Peng et al., 2023; Ziegler et al., 2024). ServiceNow recently disclosed that their "text-to-code" solution, built from fine-tuning StarCoderBase models (Li et al., 2023), results in a 52% increase in developer productivity (Yahoo Finance, 2024). Despite the initial focus on generating code snippets from natural language instructions or other code snippets, Code LLMs exhibit the potential to enhance all phases of the software development cycle (Hou et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024; Zhuo et al., 2023; Chai et al., 2023). This includes speeding up the implementation of new projects, improving quality assurance for developed software, helping detect and fix bugs, simplifying maintenance tasks, and easing migration to newer software.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The development process of LLMs can exhibit different levels of openness (Solaiman, 2023; Ding et al., 2022; Akiki et al., 2022). Proprietary models like OpenAI\'s GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023) and Google\'s Gemini (Gemini Team et al., 2023) provide access to the model through a paid API but do not disclose development details. On the other hand, open-weight models like Code LLMa (Roziere et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), and DeepSeekCoder (Guo et al., 2024) have released the model weights. This enables the open-source community to run these models locally, inspect the model representations, and fine-tune them on their tasks. However, the model developers have not disclosed their training data. Consequently, content creators do not know if their data was used for training, social scientists cannot scrutinize the dataset for bias and toxicity, and LLM developers lack information as to what extent the training set is contaminated with test benchmarks. More broadly, this practice hinders scientific progress as other research teams cannot readily reuse each other\'s training data. Other LLM development projects, like Allen AI\'s OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024), Eleuther AI\'s Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023), and BigScience\'s BLOOM (BigScience Workshop, 2022; Scao et al., 2022), have adopted a fully open development approach by releasing training data, training frameworks, and evaluation suites.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The BigCode project was established in September 2022 as an open scientific collaboration focused on the open and responsible development of Code LLMs. BigCode is stewarded by ServiceNow and Hugging Face in the spirit of open governance (BigCode collaboration et al., 2023) and has brought together more than 1,100 members from diverse academic institutes and industry labs. The community previously released The Stack v1 (Kocetkov et al., 2023), a 6.4 TB dataset of permissively licensed source code in 384 programming languages. The Stack v1 includes a governance tool called "Am I in The Stack," designed for developers to verify if their source code is included in the dataset. It also provides an opt-out process for those who prefer to exclude their code from the dataset. In December 2022, the BigCode community released SantaCoder (Ben Allal et al., 2023), a strong-performing 1.1B parameter model trained on Java, JavaScript, and Python code from The Stack v1. Building upon this success, the community further scaled up its effort and released StarCoder on May 4th, 2023 (Li et al., 2023). At its release, the 15B parameter StarCoder model was the best open-access LLM for code.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This technical report describes the development process of The Stack v2 and StarCoder2. The Stack v2 builds upon the foundation of Software Heritage\'s vast source code archive, which spans over 600 programming languages. In addition to code repositories, we curate other high-quality open data sources, including Github issues, pull requests, Kaggle and Jupyter notebooks, code documentation, and other natural language datasets related to math, coding, and reasoning. To prepare the data for training, we perform deduplication, create filters to eliminate low-quality code, redacet Personally Identifiable Information (PII), remove malicious code, and handle opt-outs from developers who requested to have their code removed from the dataset. With this new training set of 900B+ unique tokens, 4\\(\\times\\) larger than the first StarCoder dataset, we develop the next generation of StarCoder models. We train Code LLMs with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters using a two-stage training process (Roziere et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024). We start base model training with a 4k context window and subsequently fine-tune the model with a 16k context window. We ensure that the training process does not exceed more than 5 epochs over the dataset (Muennighoff et al., 2023). However, we pushthe number of training tokens far beyond the compute-optimal number suggested by Chinchilla (Harm\'s law; de Vries, 2023) and train relatively small models within the range of 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens. We thoroughly assess and compare the performance of these models on a suite of code LLM benchmarks (Cassano et al., 2023; Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2024; Cassano et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Gu et al., 2024; Cobbe et al., 2021; Pearce et al., 2022; Dhamala et al., 2021; Nozza et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020), finding that:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* The StarCoder2-3B model outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size (StableCode-3B and DeepSeeKoder-1.3B) on most benchmarks. Moreover, it matches or surpasses the performance of StarCoderBase-15B.\n' +
      '* The StarCoder2-15B model significantly outperforms other models of comparable size (CodeLlama-13B), and matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B. DeepSeeKoder-33B is the best model at code completion benchmarks for high-resource languages. However, StarCoder2-15B matches or outperforms DeepSeeKoder-33B on low-resource programming languages (e.g., D, Julia, Lua, and Perl). Moreover, when we consider benchmarks that require models to reason about code execution (Gu et al., 2024) or mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021), we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms DeepSeeKoder-33B.\n' +
      '* The StarCoder2-7B model outperforms CodeLlama-7B but is behind DeepSeeKoder-6.7B. It is not clear to this report\'s authors why StarCoder2-7B does not perform as well as StarCoder2-3B and StarCoder2-15B for their size.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Data Sources\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we elaborate on the process of obtaining training data, encompassing not just the data sourced from Software Heritage (SS2.1) but also GitHub issues (SS2.2), pull requests (SS2.3), Jupyter and Kaggle notebooks (SS2.4), documentation (SS2.5), intermediate representations (SS2.6), small math and coding datasets (SS2.7), and other natural language datasets (SS2.8).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Source Code\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Software HeritageWe build the Stack v2 on top of the Software Heritage (SH) archive (Abramatic et al., 2018), maintained by the non-profit organization of the same name. The mission of Software Heritage is to collect and preserve all knowledge taking the form of source code. We work with the SH graph dataset (Pietri et al., 2020), a fully deduplicated Merkle DAG (Merkle, 1987) representation of the full archive. The SH graph dataset links together file identifiers, source code directories, and git commits, up to the entire states of repositories, as observed during periodic crawls by Software Heritage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Extracting repositoriesWe leverage the 2023-09-06 version of the SH graph dataset as the primary source. We start by extracting the most recently crawled versions of all GitHub repositories and filtering them to retain only the main branch. The branch is considered main if the repository metadata in GHArchive lists it as the default branch or if its name is main or master. We only extract the latest revision (commit) from the main branch and deduplicate the repositories based on the unique hashes of their contents (column directory_id of the SH dataset). The repositories\' directory structure is reconstructed by recursively joining the directory_entry table of the dataset to itself using the directory_id and target columns and concatenating the directory and file names (column name) into full paths. We only traverse the directory tree up to level 64. The individual file contents are downloaded from the SH content S3 bucket if the compressed file size is less than 10MB.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'License detectionWe extract repository-level license information from GHArchive (Github Archive, 2024) for all repositories with matching names in the SWH dataset. When the repo-level license is not available, i.e., for 96.93% of repositories, we use the ScanCode Toolkit (ScanCode, 2024) to detect file-level licenses as follows:* Find all files that could contain a license using a regular expression in Appendix A.3. This allows us to gather files that either explicitly contain a license (e.g., LICENSE, MIT.txt, Apache2.0) or contain a reference to the license (e.g., README.md, GUIDELINES);\n' +
      '* Apply ScanCode\'s license detection to the matching files and gather the SPDX3 IDs of the detected licenses; Footnote 3: System Package Data Exchange, [https://spdx.dev](https://spdx.dev).\n' +
      '* Propagate the detected licenses to all files that have the same base path within the repository as the license file.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Once the file-level license information is gathered, we decide whether the file is permissively licensed, non-permissively licensed, or unlicensed, following the algorithm described in Figure 1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The licenses we consider permissive are listed in Appendix A.4. This list was compiled from the licenses approved by the Blue Oak Council (Blue Oak Council, 2024), as well as licenses categorized as "Permissive" or "Public Domain" by ScanCode (ScanCode License Categories, 2024).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data licensesWe consider three types of files: permissively licensed, non-permissively licensed (e.g., copyright), and unlicensed files. The main difference between the Stack v2 and the Stack v1 is that we include both permissively licensed and unlicensed files. We exclude commercial licenses since their creators do not intend their code to be used for commercial purposes. We also exclude copyright-licensed code due to uncertainty regarding the community\'s stance on using such data for LLM training and its relatively low volume.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Language detectionWhile the Stack v1 (Kocetkov et al., 2023) detects programming languages by their file extension, we instead rely on a language classifier. Specifically, we use go-enry based on GitHub\'s library linguist (go-enry, 2024) to detect the programming language for each file. We detect 658 unique languages in TheStackV2-dedup, some of which get removed at the data inspection stage (see next paragraph).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: File-level license assignment logic.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Visual data inspectionSimilar to the first StarCoder, we involve the BigCode community in a data inspection sprint to remove extensions with low-quality training data. We start from the annotations of the previous iteration that eliminated 36 out of the 300 extensions (of the 86 included programming languages). For StarCoder2, we only ran the data inspection for the not-yet-annotated programming languages (i.e., excluding the 86 languages of StarCoderBase). To streamline this process, we limited our inspection to extensions that include over 1,000 files and represent over 0.5% of the files in their respective languages. The remaining extensions were retained without further inspection, as they only make up a small volume. With the help of 15 annotators from the BigCode community, we visually inspected around 1000 extensions and excluded 130 (see appendix A.1 for the complete list). Our data inspection step excluded 39 programming languages from the dataset (appendix A.2), resulting in a final count of 619 programming languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Basic filtersWe apply a set of basic filters to the dataset to remove autogenerated files, data files, or other low-quality training data.\n' +

      '* First, we removed auto-generated text when users replied to issues via email (for more information, see Li et al., 2023, Appendix A). We also deleted issues with a short message (less than 200 characters) and truncated long comments in the middle to a maximum of 100 lines while retaining the last 20 lines. This removed 17% of the volume -- a similar percentage as in StarCoderBase.\n' +
      '* Next, we excluded comments from bots. To do so, we searched for keywords in the username of the comment\'s author (for more information, see Li et al., 2023, Appendix A). This step eliminated 3% of the issues, much less than the 17% reported in StarCoder (Li et al., 2023). This discrepancy is primarily because our dataset does not include pull requests, which are often the source of a significant proportion of bot-generated content.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* We used the number of users engaged in the conversation as an indicator of quality. Our criterion was to include conversations that have two or more users. However, we also preserved conversations that involved a single user if the total text within comments was less than 7,000 characters (96th percentile). Additionally, we excluded issues authored by a single user if they contained more than ten events, as they tended to be of poor quality or originate from overlooked bots. By implementing these filters, we removed 38% of the remaining issues. Lastly, we anonymized the usernames in the conversations by replacing them with a participant counter within the conversation (following the process of StarCoder).\n' +

      '### Pull Requests\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We include code reviews by gathering pull request events from GHA Archive (Github Archive, 2024) and the corresponding source code from Software Heritage (Software Heritage, 2024b). Pull requests are requests to merge particular code changes from one branch into another on GitHub. Typically, they involve multiple rounds of code review discussions and additional cycles of code changes before they get merged into the target branch.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data collectionSpecifically, for each pull request, we aggregate the PullRequestEvent, PullRequestReviewEvent, PullRequestReviewCommentEvent, IssueCommentEvent, and IssuesEvent events found on GHA Archive. More details about the differences between these events can be found in the Github documentation. Next, we extract all base and head commit IDs from these events and retrieve the corresponding code files from Software Heritage. As we do not have access to the commit diffs, we generate them by identifying changes between files at the same path. We consider files present in the base but absent in the head as deletions, while we consider files absent in the base but present in the head as additions. This process yields approximately 300M PRs, accompanied by a volume of 15 TB of base code. Among these, there are 215M closed PRs originating from around 24M repositories.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'PR filtersWe remove PRs that 1) have been opened by bots, 2) consist only of comments by bots, 3) have a non-permissive license, 4) have been opted out, 5) changes the base during the PR, 6) are not approved or merged, or 7) lack initial diffs (either due to absent data from Software Heritage or because all data have been filtered in other steps).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'File filtersWe remove files from the base commit if they satisfy one of the following conditions: 1) the file is a deletion or addition, 2) the file length exceeds 1 million characters, 3) the fraction of alphanumeric characters is less than 0.25, 4) the fraction of hexadecimal characters is greater than 0.25, 5) the max number of lines surpasses 100,000, 6) the average line length exceeds 100, 7) the max line length surpasses 1,000, or 8) the presence of non-English text in Markdown\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Title and description filteringWe apply the following heuristic filters to clean up the PRs further. We exclude PRs with changes to the base, those not approved or merged, and those lacking initial diffs (either due to absent data from Software Heritage or being filtered out in previous steps). We also exclude PRs when the title is less than 10 characters or contains the words \'dependencies\', \'dependency\', \'depend\', or\'release\'. We exclude PRs when the description is less than 20 characters or contains \'Qwiet\'.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Truncating inputsWe shorten lengthy input fields in the PRs as follows. We truncate titles to 500 characters and descriptions to 80 lines, only displaying the first 60 and the last 20 lines. If the description length still exceeds 1000 characters, we truncate it.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Processing commentsFollowing the processing of GitHub issues (SS2.2), we remove comments from bots and strip auto-generated text when users post via email reply. We anonymize the usernames of authors as described in SS3.2. We remove comments from PRs with less than 20 characters unless they are PR review comments. For code review comments, we remove the full diff hunk if it exceeds 10,000 characters while keeping the filename and comment.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Subsampling PRsTo increase the diversity in the PRs, we sub-sample them on a per-repository basis. For repositories with 1 PR (after filtering), we retain it with a probability of 0.8. We linearly decrease this retention probability to 0.1 for repositories with 1,000 PRs. For repositories with more than 1,000 PRs, we set the retention probability such that we retain only 100 PRs. Finally, we sub-sample YAML and JSON files with 10% retention probability when their file size exceeds 50% of the total base files size or when the file path contains one of the keywords: \'pack\', \'lock\', \'yarn\', \'output\',\'swagger\', \'openapi\', or \'output\'.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Max sequence lengthWe determine the maximum sequence length of PRs by first investigating the data distribution after the processing steps mentioned above. We find 3.7M PRs with up to 1M characters, resulting in 194 GB of data. This reduces to 3.3M PRs when we set a limit of 100K characters, resulting in a dataset size of 67.3 GB. (appendix A.5 has more details about sequence length statistics.) For the StarCoder2 models, we opt to include PRs with up to 100K characters (translating to roughly 25k tokens). Since we are pre-training with a limited context of 4K tokens, not all PRs fit into the context window. However, as described in SS5.2, we format the PRs so that the diffs are local and do not require long context.\n' +

      '### Notebooks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We include notebooks from two separate sources: Jupyter notebooks extracted from the Software Heritage archive and notebooks released by the Kaggle platform.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 2.4.1 Jupyter Notebooks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We transform Jupyter Notebooks into scripts and structured notebooks following the same pipeline as StarCoder (Li et al., 2023). One key difference is that we keep the markdown structure of the text blocks while it is removed in StarCoder. For completeness, we recap these preprocessing steps below.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Jupyter - scriptsWe utilize Jupyter4 to convert notebooks to scripts. To initiate the conversion process, Jupytext requires the identification of the specific programming languages within each notebook. This information is typically available in the metadata of most notebooks. In cases where it is not, we use the Guesslang library5 to identify the programming language, using a probability threshold of 0.5 or higher. Our initial dataset comprised 11 million notebooks, of which 3 million were excluded due to parsing errors. After near-deduplication, the dataset was reduced to 4 million notebooks converted to scripts.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Jupyter - structuredTo create this dataset, we first filtered out notebooks that did not contain any Python code or Markdown text using the metadata information of each notebook. Only notebooks explicitly marked as \'Python\' in the metadata were kept. Then, for each notebook, consecutive Markdown blocks or code blocks were merged into a single Markdown or code block, respectively. Eventually, we ended up with consecutive code-text pairs in temporal order grouped by each notebook. Each Jupyter code-text pair contained the Markdown text immediately preceding the code block and the Python code, forming a natural instruction pair. We also included the formatted output of a code block if the output cell was non-empty; otherwise, it was marked by a special <empty_output> token. If consecutive code blocks have multiple output cells before merging, we only retain the output of the last code block. After these preprocessing steps and near-deduplication, we ended up with 4.6M structured Jupyter notebooks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 2.4.2 Kaggle Notebooks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We include Python notebooks released by the Kaggle platform6 under an Apache 2.0 license, starting with an initial dataset of 3.6M notebooks. Note that this Kaggle dataset does not include the output cells, only the markdown and code cells.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'CleaningWe start the data cleaning process by dropping notebooks with less than 100 characters and those with syntax errors. We also remove the templated text at the beginning of notebooks (see appendix A.7for the templates). These steps remove 18% of the notebooks. Next, we convert the notebooks to the structured and script format, following the processing of the Jupyter notebooks in SS2.4.1. Finally, we remove near-duplicates using the pipeline described in SS3.1, eliminating 78% of the notebooks and leaving us with 580k notebooks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Dataset descriptionTo provide the model with more context regarding the content and objectives of the notebook, we include metadata about the Kaggle dataset whenever this information is available. We find that 42% of the notebooks are associated with a Kaggle dataset and include its title and description at the beginning of each notebook.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Dataset schemaIn addition to these high-level dataset descriptions, we scanned the code inside the notebooks for instances of read_csv. We found that 25% of the samples were loading CSV datasets. We extracted and incorporated detailed information about these datasets as follows. First, we used the Kaggle API to download the datasets and successfully retrieved 8.6% of the notebooks. The remaining cases were attributed to either the dataset being unavailable or encountering challenges downloading it within a reasonable time frame. For the downloaded datasets, we prefix the output of df.info() to the notebook, which displays the column names and their dtypes, the non-null values count, and the memory usage. We also include four sample rows from the dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Documentation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Documentation from package managersWe crawl documentation from several package manager platforms, including npm, PyPI, Go Packages, Packagist, Rubygems, Cargo, CocoaPods, Bower, CPAN, Clojars, Conda, Hex and Julia. We first retrieve the names of the most popular libraries across various platforms from libraries.io. These library names are then used to search through individual package managers, enabling us to obtain the respective homepages for each library. We systematically crawled the documentation files from the obtained homepage links or, alternatively, extracted information from the provided README or documentation files on the platform. For documents obtained through homepage links, we adhere to the same processing strategy outlined below in the paragraph titled "Documentation from websites". When extracting documents from the REwang2023softwareADME or documentation files on the platform, we employ distinct heuristics to extract the text using markdown formats whenever feasible, aiming to maintain a simple and effective format. It is worth noting that many libraries available on PyPI and Conda have their associated documentation hosted on Read the Docs, which typically offers more comprehensive documentation. Consequently, we prioritize utilizing Read the Docs as the primary source of documentation for these libraries. For these documents hosted on Read the Docs, we follow the same processing procedure outlined in the paragraph titled "Documentation from websites".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'PDFs from package managersFor documents related to the R language, we extracted text from all PDF files hosted on CRAN using the pdftotext library.7 This library is particularly effective in preserving the formatting, including spaces within code snippets. For LaTeX-related documentation, we extracted the documentation, tutorial, and usage guide PDFs of LaTeX packages from CTAN, filtered out image-heavy PDFs, and converted the rest into markdown using the Nougat neural OCR tool.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 7: [https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext](https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Documentation from websitesWe collect code documentation from a carefully curated list of websites as detailed in Table 2. We start by systematically exploring the website from its initial URL listed in Table 2, using a queue to store URLs within the same domain. This queue expands dynamically as we discover new links during the crawl. Given that most documents comprise HTML pages, we focus our processing pipeline on (1) content extraction and (2) content concatenation. To extract the content, we utilize the trafilatura library8 to convert each HTML page into XML format, simultaneously eliminating redundant navigation and index bars, elements that often recur in documentation. Next, we converted the XML format to markdown using our XML-to-Markdown conversion script. In the second stage, to compile these documents into a single text, we first do a near-deduplication of the content extracted from different HTML pages. Thisstep was essential since we have observed that certain document pages only comprise website layouts (e.g., navigation bars) instead of fruitful information for documents, resulting in a substantial amount of duplicated content. To accomplish this, we treat each HTML page from a single website as a cluster and apply the minhash locality-sensitive hashing technique to identify and eliminate similar pages, using a threshold of 0.7. Finally, we assemble the gathered content from different pages of the same website in the order of web page crawling, ensuring a cohesive narrative. This parallels the "breadth-first search" approach, where all nodes at the current depth are explored before proceeding to the next depth level. Also, we collected code-relevant data from existing web crawls such as **RefinedWeb**(Penedo et al., 2023), **OSCAR**(Ortiz Suarez et al., 2019), and **esCorpius**(Gutierrez-Fandino et al., 2022). We use regular expressions to identify programming language-specific constructs within the documents and to detect the "docs." substring in the page URLs. The resulting dataset primarily comprises content sourced from programming blogs, coding tutorials, and platforms like Read the Docs, with the exclusion of the documents gathered above.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Free textbooksWe scraped free programming books compiled in the Free Programming Books project, which aims at promoting the distribution of free programming e-books. First, we extract all links and identify those with a PDF extension. Subsequently, we downloaded all available PDF files and utilized the pdf2text library to extract text from these PDF files. Finally, we parsed 3,541 books whose languages span across different regions, including English, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and others.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Language identificationFinally, we have employed a dual approach to identify the main programming language used by each document. We leverage predefined rules when the source of the document unequivocally corresponds to a specific programming language and resort to the guesslang9 library in cases where such correspondence is not explicit. The resultant programming language distribution is graphically represented in Figure 2.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'LlvmWe select LLVM (Lattner and Adve, 2004) as the intermediate representation due to its widespread availability on GitHub, increasing the probability that there is sufficient training data to learn the semantics of the language. In addition, LLVM is widely adopted as an IR and is the target representation of many compiler frontends across several programming languages.10\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Data collectionExisting attempts to extract IR from free-form source code either suffer from low compilation success rates (Szafraniec et al., 2023) or use bespoke language-specific mechanisms to track dependency code to compile successfully (Grossman et al., 2023). We sidestep this by sourcing self-contained compilation units from accepted solutions to programming word problems (Rosetta Code, 2023; Mirzayanov, 2020; Puri et al., 2021; Caballero et al., 2016). We compile \\(\\approx\\)4M sources in total across C++, C, Objective-C, Python, Rust, Go, Haskell, D, Fortran, Swift, and Nim in size optimized (-O2 equivalent) and performance optimized (-O3 equivalent) mode. We opt to use the size-optimized IR in most of the pairs due to context length considerations. However, for 20% of the pairs, we use the performance-optimized IR. This is done to maximize transfer from the pre-training stage, where the model sees LLVM code in the wild, which is more likely to be in this form. We use clang11 for compiling C++, C and Objective-C, codon12 for compiling Python, rustc13 for compiling Rust, gollvm14 for compiling Go, ghc15 for compiling Haskell, ldc16 for compiling D, flang17 for compiling Fortran, and nlvm18 for compiling Nim. We clean headers along with superfluous platform, vendor, and memory layout-specific information from the IR before pairing it with its source.\n' +

      'StackOverflowWe include 11 million questions and their corresponding multiple responses from the Stack Overflow dump dated 2023-09-14 (StackExchange Archive, 2024). We filtered out questions with fewer than three answers. Upon inspecting the dataset, we found many mismatches between questions and answers due to inherent format errors in the Stack Overflow dump. We leveraged Llama-2-70b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023) to increase the quality of the dataset as follows. We selected 20,000 examples and asked Llama-2-70b-chat-hf to rate the question-answer pairs. See Appendix A.6 for the exact prompt. Next, we pick the 10,000 highest-scoring pairs as positive examples and use the remaining 10,000 answers to create negative examples by randomly pairing them with other questions. We use this dataset to train a binary classifier by embedding the question and answer with a well-performing sentence embedding model (sentence-transformers/all-MiniM-L12-v220(Reimers & Gurevych, 2019; Muennighoff et al., 2022)) and minimizing the cosine distance between them. Next, we plot the embedding scores for a subset of the question-answer pairs and manually determine the threshold to 0.1. As a question can have multiple answers, we average the scores of question-answer pairs and remove all questions with an average score below 0.1. We end up with 11.4 million questions and over 10B tokens.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ArXivWe include the ArXiv subset of the RedPajama dataset (Together Computer, 2023). This dataset is downloaded from the publicly available Amazon S3 bucket (Arxiv, 2024).

      '\n' +
      'We apply several preprocessing steps, such as deduplication (SS3.1), PII redaction (SS3.2), benchmark decontamination (SS3.3), malware removal (SS3.4), and opt-out deletion requests (SS3.5), to the data sources described in the previous section.

      'We followed the deduplication pipeline of SantaCoder (Ben Allal et al., 2023). This process first calculates the MinHashes (Broder, 2000) of all code files and then utilizes Locally Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to group files based on their MinHash fingerprints. During the LSH stage, "similar" files are assigned to the same buckets, identifying them as duplicates. Only one file from each duplicate group is chosen. In addition to the SantaCoder approach, to preserve repository context, we prioritize files from repositories with higher star and fork counts or from the latest commit date as a tiebreaker. We used 5-grams and a Jaccard similarity of 0.7. We refer to this blogpost for more background information regarding the deduplication pipeline.\n' +

      'Redacting PII entitiesWe use StarPII to redact names, emails, keys, passwords, IP addresses, and usernames from source code, pull requests, issues, and StackOverflow.

      'Redacting usernamesThe conversations in issues, pull requests, and StackOverflow often contain usernames in the message thread.

These pseudonyms are added at the start of each comment to maintain the speaker\'s identity. Moreover, any references to these usernames in the messages are removed. Only the usernames of actively participating individuals in the conversation are masked, and mentions of non-participating users remain unaffected.\n' +

Specifically, we remove files that contain docstrings or solutions from HumanEval and MBPP, docstrings from APPS, questions from GSM8K, or prompts from DS1000. In contrast to the first iteration of StarCoder (Li et al., 2023), we further enhance the recall of the decontamination process by removing whitespace during string matching.

Signatures with a high risk of False Positives (as determined by SaneSecurity) were not used. See Table 26 for the most frequently detected malware signatures in the unfiltered code dataset.

      '\n' +
      'Model capacityWith a much larger training set available, we decided to tailor our data composition to each model size. We reason that smaller models, having limited capacity, should be exposed to a less diverse dataset. This intuition is supported by research in multi-lingual NLP showing that languages compete for model capacity (Arivazhagan et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2020; Scao et al., 2022). Hence, we first create a smaller version of the SWH code dataset, selecting a subset of 17 widely-used programming languages. We use this variant to train the 3B and 7B models, whereas we use the full version with all 619 programming languages for the 15B model. To further limit the diversity in the training set for the 3B model, we also exclude some natural language datasets (see "Data composition per model size").\n' +

Before constructing the source code datasets, we examined the data distribution among the programming languages.

The observed data volume (in GB) is as follows: Java (479.68), JavaScript (277.25), C++ (204.49), Python (190.99), PHP (171.57), C# (166.22), and C (114.49).

      'About the benchmarksHumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) are two of the most widely studied benchmarks for Code LLMs. Each benchmark has a few hundred programming problems. Each HumanEval problem has a prompt--a function signature and docstring--and a set of hidden unit tests. The prompt for each MBPP problem includes a natural language description followed by a few tests. The model under evaluation will complete the function given the prompt, and we test that function with the hidden unit tests. The result is considered a success only if all hidden tests pass.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recently, Liu et al. (2023a) identified several issues with both benchmarks. (1) Most problems have inadequate hidden tests that cannot detect subtle bugs in solutions (See Listings 1 and 2); and (2) Several problems have wrong test cases and ambiguous descriptions, which unfairly penalize the models that interpret the statements in other reasonable ways (See Listings 2). They introduce the EvalPlus framework to address these problems. The resulting benchmarks (HumanEval+ and MBPP+) have \\(80\\times\\) and \\(35\\times\\) more tests than the original benchmarks. For rigorous evaluation, we adopt the EvalPlus framework in this study.\n' +

      '3. StarCoder2-15B is the best-performing large model by a significant margin. For example, it scores 46.3, whereas CodeLlama-13B scores 37.8 on HumanEval. The results on EvalPlus are also consistent. For example, on HumanEval+, it significantly improves over StarCoderBase-15B and CodeLlama-13B by 47.7% and 17.0%, respectively.\n' +

The benchmark supports six programming languages shown in Figure 12. Since it is not a code completion benchmark, most base models do poorly on HumanEvalFix whereas instruction-tuned (Wei et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2022; 2024) models perform better. Thus, we consider the instruction-tuned variants of DeepSeekCoder and CodeLlama in our comparison (Guo et al., 2024; Roziere et al., 2023). We also compare with OctoCoder, which is an instruction-tuned version of the initial StarCoder using the CommitPackFT dataset (Muennighoff et al., 2024; Zhuo et al., 2024; Longpre et al., 2023). We benchmarked the default HumanEvalFixTests subvariant; hence, there were no docstrings present to guide the model.\n' +

Additional prompt engineering may be necessary to fix this. Thus, we still see value in instruction tuning StarCoder2 to further improve its usability in handling similar scenarios more effectively without prompt engineering.

      '\n' +
      'About the benchmarkCanItEdit (Cassano et al., 2024) is a hand-crafted benchmark designed to evaluate model performance in Python code editing tasks. Each problem consists of a code snippet accompanied by an instruction of two types: _descriptive_ or _lazy_. Descriptive instructions are systematic and provide detailed information, whereas lazy instructions are brief, direct, and mimic the typical instructions humans provide to code completion models. The goal is to modify the code according to the instruction; both lazy and descriptive instructions should lead to the same edit. The accuracy of each modification is assessed using a hidden test suite, and pass@1 is reported. The benchmark encompasses a variety of problems, from simple single-function, single-line edits to intricate multi-class problems requiring multiple-line edits in separate locations. Some tasks demand domain-specific knowledge like mathematics, and successful completion of a problem often requires the model to understand the connections between the components of the program. Listing 3 shows an abbreviated27 sample problem from CanItEdit with its lazy instruction.\n' +

      'Open-scienceStarCoder2 is the output of a community research project. The project is conducted in the spirit of Open Science (Woelfle et al., 2011; Mendez et al., 2020), focused on the responsible development and use of Code LLMs. Through open-governance practices, priority in decision-making has always yielded to the more responsible option, even if this meant introducing limitations that might impact adoption or future research (BigCode collaboration et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Ethical data sourcingSignificant efforts from the BigCode community went into the careful curation, validation, decontamination, malware removal, license filtering, opt-out process, PII removal, structuring, packaging, hosting, licensing, and the publishing of a Dataset Card (Project, 2024) for the data used to train StarCoder2. Full transparency has been provided about the data used for training StarCoder2. A significant portion of the training dataset was sourced under license from Software Heritage (Software Heritage, 2024a).\n' +

      'Community of practiceBigCode is very much a community of practice, with over 1,200 multi-disciplinary members from more than 60 countries working towards the responsible development of large language models for code (Sholler et al., 2019; Koetkov et al., 2023; Ben Allal et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Muenninghoff et al., 2024; Zhuo et al., 2024). Of these members, 417 were active in the BigCode community collaboration tools within the period 27 October 2023 through 24 February 2024, the period aligning with StarCoder2 development. There has also been considerable downstream adoption of BigCode outputs, with millions of downloads collectively reported via the Hugging Face API (BigCode, 2024).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'AuditableThe StarCoder2 model, pre-training dataset, and supporting artifacts are easily accessible and available to anyone who wishes to conduct an independent audit (Solaiman, 2023; Mokander et al., 2023; BigCode collaboration et al., 2023).\n' +

      'Governance CardThe BigCode Governance Card (BigCode collaboration et al., 2023) serves as an overview of the different mechanisms and areas of governance in the BigCode project. It aims to support transparency by providing relevant information about choices that were made during the project to the broader public and to serve as an example of intentional governance (Sholler et al., 2019) of an open research project that future endeavors can leverage to shape their own approach. The first section, Project Structure, covers the project organization, its stated goals and values, its internal decision processes, and its funding and resources. The second section, Data and Model Governance, covers decisions relating to the questions of data subject consent, privacy, and model release.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Archival of software metadata:Software metadata is vital for the classification, curation, and sharing of free and open-source software (FOSS). The source code landscape is very diverse. By generating linked data and referencing source code contributions within the Software Heritage archive from the global community of developers and scientists (Heritage, 2024), there is potential to enable a more ethical data supply chain for training LLMs (Cosmo and Zacchiroli, 2017; Abramatic et al., 2018).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Acceptable ML use:On October 19, 2023, Software Heritage published a statement that defines the acceptable machine learning use of the Software Heritage archive. This is a significant milestone that opens the door for more responsible data sourcing and licensing of AI training data (Software Heritage, 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'SoftWare Hash IDentifiers (SWHID):Software Heritage provides the SWHID unique identifiers, intrinsically bound to the software components, and that need no central registry, to ensure that a resilient web of knowledge can be built on top of the Software Heritage archive (The SWHID Specification Project, 2024). This can also be used by downstream developers to support efforts for those companies that prioritize a "software bill of materials" (SBOM) as a key building block in software security and software supply chain transparency and risk management (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2024; Mirakhorli et al., 2024), for example by including the SWHIDs in the SBOM, alongside other relevant information such as component names, versions, licenses, and source locations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Challenges and Risks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Openness and safety risksSolaiman (2023) explains how the degree of openness in the LLM development process is connected to the potential risks associated with a model release. When systems are developed in a fully closed manner, it is more likely for power to become concentrated among high-resourced organizations, and the small development team may not fully comprehend the impact and long-term consequences of the model being deployed. In addition, closed-development systems are often less auditable by external experts and can impede scientific progress since researchers cannot build upon each other\'s work. On the other hand, fully open development allows for community research, democratizes access to the models, and enables audits throughout the whole development process. However, without appropriate guardrails, open LLM development poses a higher risk of misuse, as increased model access also increases the likelihood of harm caused by the model. Even though a released API can be shut down, once the model weights are released, it is nearly impossible to retract them. Discussing and implementing responsible AI practices has, therefore, been front and center during the development of our project\'s LLMs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Privacy compliant generated codeIt is difficult to correctly identify and classify the different types of PII so that personal data processing, transformations, and flows through code can be evaluated (Tang et al., 2023). Where privacy-relevant methods are invoked in generated code, checking for PII leaks to the internet, use of encrypted data and anonymous IDs, will be necessary (Tang & Ostvold, 2024). Downstream users are advised to implement additional PII scanning, filtering, cleansing, and mitigation to ensure compliance with their intended use cases (Yang et al., 2023; Albalak et al., 2024).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'SecurityAs with any open scientific research that provides open access to model weights, hyper-parameters, data processing code, training code, training data, and documentation, any actor can run or fine-tune the optimized model with very low computing costs (Governance AI, 2024). Even with the use restrictions set forth within the BigCode Open RAIL-M license, this will not prevent bad actors with malicious intent from attempting to cause harm (Mozes et al., 2023). For example, code LLMs with API access could be used to create sophisticated polymorphic malware (CrowdStrike, 2024) that would be highly evasive to security products that rely on signature-based detection and will be able to bypass measures such as Anti-Malware Scanning Interface (AMSI) as it eventually executes and runs code (CyberArk, 2024; Gupta et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Societal biasAs has been previously established in evaluations of coding models, code LLMs can generate code with a structure that reflects stereotypes about gender, race, emotion, class, the structure of names, and other characteristics (Chen et al., 2021; Zhuo et al., 2023a). Further evaluation and guardrail mitigations are required in the context of downstream use cases (Huang et al., 2023; Dong et al., 2024).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Representation biasAs discussed in previous sections, there is a lot more data in the training dataset for popular programming languages like Python and Java than for niche languages like Haskell and Fortran. As such, the model performs better on such high-resource languages, which may reinforce the preference of developers towards using such languages. Fortunately, there\'s much ongoing research on how to improve the performance of Code LLMs on low-resource languages (Cassano et al., 2023a; Zhuo et al., 2023b). Furthermore,the predominant natural language in source code and other datasets used is English although other languages are also present. As such, the model can generate code snippets provided some non-English context, but the generated code is not guaranteed to work as intended or equally as well for all languages. This could limit the model\'s fairness and effectiveness across different coding tasks and environments (Alyafeai et al., 2024).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'TraceabilityUsing the SWHID to trace software components is not an easy task and will challenge most if not all, downstream developers. Future development and advancement of tools that make it easier to trace software components will be necessary to enable more transparent and responsible data supply chains (Cosmo et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Job augmentation vs. automationCode LLMs serve as powerful foundation models that can be fine-tuned to generate high-quality code, documentation, unit tests, text summaries, automation workflows, and more. Chen et al. (2023) find a positive correlation between occupation exposure and wage levels/experience premiums, suggesting higher-paying and experience-intensive jobs may face greater displacement risks from LLM-powered software. Goldman Sachs (2024) suggest that AI has the potential to automate 25% of labor tasks in advanced economies and 10 - 20% in emerging economies, however, they also state that "those fears should be counterbalanced, since AI has the potential to create new job tasks or categories requiring specialized human expertise". Autor et al. (2022) reports that "Roughly 60% of employment in 2018 is found in job titles that did not exist in 1940." and that "augmentation innovations boost occupational labor demand, while automation innovations erode it". Results from the task-based analysis in (World Economic Forum, 2024) reveal that jobs with the highest potential for automation of tasks by LLMs emphasize routine and repetitive procedures and do not require a high degree of interpersonal communication. Jobs with the highest potential for augmentation by LLMs emphasize critical thinking and complex problem-solving skills, especially those in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Ziegler et al. (2024) reports the benefits of receiving AI suggestions while coding span the full range of typically investigated aspects of productivity, such as task time, product quality, cognitive load, enjoyment, and learning. In (Peng et al., 2023), a two-year collaboration between Google Core and Google Research (Brain Team), they find that of the 10k+ Google-internal developers using the code completion setup in their IDE, they measured user\'s code acceptance rate of 25-34%. Yahoo Finance (2024) announced ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE: NOW) 2024 Q4 Earnings with coverage that the ServiceNow platform Now Assist skills using text-to-code (ServiceNow, 2024b) and text-to-workflow (ServiceNow, 2024a) LLMs (based on StarCoder), augment and increased developer productivity and speed of innovation by 52%.\n' +

      '## 10 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We introduced StarCoder2, a family of LLMs designed for code generation, along with The Stack v2, the largest pre-training corpus for Code LLMs built on the foundations of the Software Heritage archive. The Stack v2 is ten times larger than its predecessor, yielding a raw dataset of 67.5 TB. Through extensive cleaning, filtering, and subsampling of the source code, along with the incorporation of other high-quality code-related datasets, we created a training set of approximately 3TB (900B+ tokens). Leveraging this new dataset, we trained StarCoder2 models with 3B, 7B, and 15B parameters. Our extensive Code LLM evaluations, assessing code completion, editing, and reasoning capabilities, revealed that StarCoder2-3B and StarCoder2-15B are state-of-the-art models within their respective size classes. By not only releasing the model weights but also ensuring complete transparency regarding the training data, we hope to increase trust in the developed models and empower other engineering teams and scientists to build upon our efforts.\n' +
