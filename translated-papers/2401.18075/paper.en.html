      '\n' +
      'We propose CARFF: Conditional Auto-encoded Radiance Field for 3D Scene Forecasting, a method for predicting future 3D scenes given past observations, such as 2D ego-centric images. Our method maps an image to a distribution over plausible 3D latent scene configurations using a probabilistic encoder, and predicts the evolution of the hypothesized scenes through time. Our latent scene representation conditions a global Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to represent a 3D scene model, which enables explainable predictions and straightforward downstream applications. This approach extends beyond previous neural rendering work by considering complex scenarios of uncertainty in environmental states and dynamics. We employ a two-stage training of Pose-Conditional-VAE and NeRF to learn 3D representations. Additionally, we auto-regressively predict latent scene representations as a partially observable Markov decision process, utilizing a mixture density network. We demonstrate the utility of our method in realistic scenarios using the CARLA driving simulator, where CARFF can be used to enable efficient trajectory and contingency planning in complex multi-agent autonomous driving scenarios involving visual occlusions.

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Humans often imagine what they cannot see given partial visual context. Consider a scenario where reasoning about the unobserved is critical to safe decision-making: for example, a driver navigating a blind intersection. An expert driver will plan according to what they believe may or may not exist in occluded regions of their vision. The driver\'s belief - defined as the understanding of the world modeled with consideration for inherent uncertainties of real-world environments - is informed by their partial observations (i.e., the presence of other vehicles on the road), as well as their prior knowledge (e.g., past experience navigating this intersection). When reasoning about the unobserved, humans are capable of holding complex beliefs over not just the existence and position of individual objects (e.g., whether or not there is an oncoming car), but also the shapes, colors, and textures composing the entire occluded portion of the scene.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Traditionally, autonomous systems with high-dimensional sensor observations such as video or LiDAR process the data into low-dimensional state information, such as the position and velocity of tracked objects, which are then used for downstream prediction and planning. This object-centric framework can be extended to reason about partially observed settings by modeling the existence and state of potentially dangerous unobserved objects in addition to tracked fully observed objects. Such systems often plan with respect to worst-case hypotheses, e.g., by placing a "ghost car" traveling at speed on the edge of the visible field of view [41].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recent advances in neural rendering have seen tremendous success in learning 3D scene representations directly from posed multi-view images using deep neural networks. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) allow for synthesizing novel images in a 3D scene from arbitrary viewing angles, making seeing behind an occlusion as simple as rendering from an unoccluded camera angle. Because NeRF can generate RGB images from novel views, it decouples the dependency of the scene representation on the object detec\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: **CARFF 3D planning application for driving**. An input image containing a partially observable view of an intersection is processed by CARFF’s encoder to establish 3D environment state beliefs, i.e. the predicted possible state of the world: whether or not there could be another vehicle approaching the intersection. These beliefs are used to forecast the future in 3D for planning, generating one among two possible actions for the vehicle to merge into the other lane.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'tion and tracking pipeline. For example, images rendered from a NeRF may contain visual information that would be lost by an object detector, but may still be relevant for safe decision-making. Additionally, because NeRF represents explicit geometry via an implicit density map, it can be used directly for motion planning without requiring any rendering [1]. NeRF\'s ability to represent both visual and geometric information makes them a more general and intuitive 3D representation for autonomous systems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite NeRF\'s advantages, achieving probabilistic predictions in 3D based on reasoning from the occluded is challenging. For example, discriminative models that yield categorical predictions are unable to capture the underlying 3D structure, impeding their ability to model uncertainty. While prior work on 3D representation captures view-invariant structures, their application is primarily confined to simple scenarios [17]. We present CARFF, which to our knowledge, is the first forecasting approach in scenarios with partial observations that uniquely facilitates stochastic predictions within a 3D representation, effectively integrating visual perception and explicit geometry.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'CARFF addresses the aforementioned difficulties by proposing _PC-VAE_: Pose-Conditioned Variational Autoencoder, a framework that trains a convolution and Vision Transformer (ViT) [9] based image encoder. The encoder maps a potentially partially observable ego-centric image to latent scene representations, which hold state beliefs with implicit probabilities. The latents later condition a neural radiance field that functions as a 3D decoder to recover 3D scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. This is trained after PC-VAE in our two-stage training pipeline (see Sec. 3.1). Additionally, we design a mixture density model to predict the evolution of 3D scenes over time stochastically in the encoder belief space (see Sec. 3.2). A potential application of CARFF is illustrated in Fig. 1. Using the CARLA driving simulator, we demonstrate how CARFF can be used to enable contingency planning in real-world driving scenarios that require reasoning into visual occlusions.\n' +

      '### Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Neural radiance fields:** Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [2, 23, 39] for 3D representations have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate high-resolution, photorealistic scenes. Instant Neural Graphics Primitive (Instant-NGP) [24] speeds up training and rendering time by introducing a multi-resolution hash encoding. Other works like Plenoxels [11] and DirectVoxGo (DVGO) [38] also provide similar speedups. Given the wide adoption and speedups of Instant-NGP, we use it to model 3D radiance fields in our work. NeRFs have also been extended for several tasks such as modeling large-scale unbounded scenes [2, 40, 46], scene from sparse views [7, 35, 45] and multiple scenes [17, 48]. Tewari et al. [42] presents an in-depth survey on neural representation learning and its applications.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Generalizable novel view synthesis models such as pixelNeRF and pixelSplat [5, 51] learn a scene prior to render novel views conditioned on sparse existing views. Dynamic NeRF, on the other hand, models scenes with moving objects or objects undergoing deformation. A widely used approach is to construct a canonical space and predict a deformation field [19, 29, 30, 32]. The canonical space is usually a static scene, and the model learns an implicitly represented flow field [29, 32]. A recent line of work also models dynamic scenes via different representations and decomposition [3, 37]. These approaches tend to perform better for spatially bounded and predictable scenes with relatively small variations [3, 20, 29, 51]. Moreover, these methods only solve for changes in the environment but are limited in incorporating stochasticity in the environment.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Multi-scene NeRF:** Our approach builds on multi-scene NeRF approaches [17, 44, 48, 49] that learn a global latent scene representation, which conditions the NeRF, allowing a single NeRF to effectively represent various scenes. A similar method, NeRF-VAE, was introduced by Kosiorek _et al._[17] to create a geometrically consistent 3D generative model with generalization to out-of-distribution cameras. However, NeRF-VAE [17] is prone to mode collapse when evaluated on complex, real-world datasets.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '**Planning in 2D space:** In general, planning in large and continuous state-action spaces is difficult due to the resulting exponentially large search space [28]. Consequently, several approximation methods have been proposed for tractability [22, 31]. Various model-free [12, 27, 43] and model-based [4] reinforcement learning frameworks emerge as viable approaches, along with other learning-based methods [6, 25]. Several other approaches forecast for downstream control [15], learn behavior models for contingency planning [34], or predict potential existence and intentions of possibly unobserved agents [26]. While these methods are in 2D, we similarly reason under partial observations, and account for these factors in 3D.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**NeRF in robotics:** Several recent works have explored the application of NeRFs in robotics, like localization [50], navigation [1, 21], dynamics-modeling [10, 19] and robotic grasping [14, 16]. Adamkiewicz et al. [1] proposes a method for quadcopter motion planning in NeRF models via sampling the learned density function, which is a desirable characteristic of NeRF that can be leveraged for forecasting and planning purposes. Additionally, Driess et al. [10] utilize a graph neural network to learn a dynamics model in a multi-object scene represented through NeRF. Li et al. [18] primarily perform pushing tasks in a scene with basic shapes, and approach grasping and planning with NeRF and a separately learned latent dynamics model. Prior work either only performs well on simple and static scenes [1] or has a deterministic dynamics model [18]. CARFF focuses on complicated realistic environments involving both state uncertainty and dynamics uncertainty, which account for the potential existence of an object and unknown object movements respectively.\n' +

      '## 3 Method\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3D scene representation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, allowing for modeling environments in a contextually rich and interactive 3D space. This offers many analytical benefits, such as producing soft occupancy grids for spatial analysis and novel view synthesis for object detection. Given the advantages, our primary objective is to develop a model for probabilistic 3D scene forecasting in dynamic environments. However, direct integration of 3D scene representation via NeRF and probabilistic models like VAE often involves non-convex and inter-dependent optimization, which causes unstable training. For instance, NeRF\'s optimization may rely on the VAE\'s latent space being structured to provide informative gradients.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To navigate these complexities, our method bifurcates the training process into two stages (see Fig. 3). First, we train the PC-VAE to learn view-invariant scene representations. Next, we replace the decoder with a NeRF to learn a 3D scene from the latent representations. The latent scene representations capture the environmental states and dynamics over possible underlying scenes, while NeRF synthesizes novel views within the belief space, giving us the ability to see the unobserved (see Fig. 2 and Sec. 3.1). During prediction, uncertainties can be modeled by sampling latents auto-regressively from a predicted Gaussian mixture, allowing for effective decision-making. To this extent, we approach scene forecasting as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) over latent distributions, which enables us to capture multi-modal beliefs for planning amidst perceptual uncertainty (see Sec. 3.2).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### NeRF Pose-Conditional VAE (PC-VAE)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Architecture:Given a scene \\(S_{t}\\) at timestamp \\(t\\), we render an ego-centric observation image \\(I_{c}^{t}\\) captured from camera pose \\(c\\). The objective is to formulate a 3D representation of the image where we can perform a forecasting step that evolves the scene forward. To achieve this, we utilize a radiance field conditioned on latent variable \\(z\\) sampled from the posterior distribution \\(q_{\\phi}(z|I_{c}^{t})\\). Now, to learn the posterior, we utilize PC-VAE. We construct an encoder using convolutional layers and a pre-trained ViT on ImageNet [9]. The encoder learns a mapping from the image space to a Gaussian distributed latent space \\(q_{\\phi}(z|I_{c}^{t})=\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^{2})\\) parametrized by mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). The decoder, \\(p(I|z,c)\\), conditioned on camera pose \\(c\\), maps the latent \\(z\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma^{2})\\) into the image space \\(I\\). This helps the encoder to generate latents that are invariant to the camera pose \\(c\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To enable 3D scene modeling, we employ Instant-NGP [24], which incorporates a hash grid and an occupancy grid to enhance computation efficiency. Additionally, a smaller multilayer perceptron (MLP), \\(F_{\\theta}(z)\\) can be utilized to model the density and appearance, given by:\n' +

      'Here, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}\\in(\\theta,\\phi)\\) represent the location vector and the viewing direction respectively. The MLP is also conditioned on the sampled scene latents \\(z\\sim q_{\\phi}(z|I_{c}^{t})\\) (see Appendix C).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Training methodology:The architecture alone does not enable us to model complex real-world scenarios, as seen through a similar example in NeRF-VAE [17]. A crucial contribution of our work is our two-stage training framework which stabilizes the training. First, we optimize the convolutional ViT based encoder and pose-conditional convolutional decoder in the pixel space for reconstruction. This enables our method to deal with more complex and realistic scenes as the encoding is learned in a semantically rich 2D space. By conditioning the decoder on camera poses, we achieve disentanglement between camera view angles and scene context, making the representation view-invariant and the encoder 3D-aware. Next, once rich latent representations are learned, we replace the decoder with a latent-conditioned NeRF over the latent space of the frozen encoder. The NeRF reconstructs encoder beliefs in 3D for novel view synthesis.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'KL divergence regularizes the latent space to balance conditioned reconstruction and stochasticity under occlusion. An elevated KL divergence loss weight \\(w_{\\textit{KL}}\\) pushes the latents closer to a standard normal distribution, \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\), thereby ensuring probabilistic sampling in scenarios under partial observation.

      'Formulation:The current formulation allows us to model scenes with different configurations across timestamps.

      '\n' +
      'During inference, we observe stochastic behaviors under occlusion, which motivates us to learn a mixture of several Gaussian distributions that potentially denote different scene possibilities. Therefore, we model the POMDP using a Mixture Density Network (_MDN_), with multi-headed MLPs, that predicts a mixture of \\(K\\) Gaussians. At any timestamp \\(t\\) the distribution is given as:\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Decision-making under perceptual uncertainty is a pervasive challenge faced in robotics and autonomous driving, especially in partially observable environments encountered in driving tasks. In these scenarios, accurate inference regarding the presence of potentially obscured agents is pivotal. We evaluate the effectiveness of CARFF on similar real-world situations with partial observability. We implemented several scenarios in the CARLA driving simulator [8] (see Fig. 4). A single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU is used to train PC-VAE, NeRF, and the MDN. All models, trained sequentially, tend to converge within a combined time frame of 24 hours. A detailed experimental setup can be found in Appendix C. We show that, given partially observable 2D inputs, CARFF performs well in predicting latent distributions that represent complete 3D scenes. Using these predictions we design a CARFF-based controller for performing downstream planning tasks.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We generate datasets containing an ego object and varying actor objects in different configurations to test the robustness of our method. We conduct experiments on (a) synthetic blender dataset for simple, controllable simulation and (b) CARLA-based driving datasets for complicated real-world scenarios [8].\n' +

      'Blender synthetic dataset:This comprises of a stationary blue cube (ego) accompanied by a red cylinder (actor) that may or may not be present (see Fig. 5). If the actor is present, it exhibits lateral movement as depicted in Fig. 5. This simplistic setting provides us with an interpretable framework to evaluate our model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'CARLA dataset:Each dataset is simulated for \\(N\\) timestamps and uses \\(C=100\\) predefined camera poses to capture images of the environment under full observation, partial observation, and no visibility. These datasets are modeled after common driving scenarios involving state uncertainty that have been proposed in related works such as Active Visual Planning [25].\n' +

      'Single-Scene Approaching IntersectionThe ego vehicle is positioned at a T-intersection with an actor vehicle traversing the crossing along an evenly spaced, predefined trajectory. We simulate this for \\(N=10\\) timestamps. We mainly use this dataset to predict the evolution of timestamps under full observation.\n' +

      '### CARFF Evaluation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A desirable behavior from our model is that it should predict a complete set of possible scenes consistent with the given ego-centric image, which could be partially observable. This is crucial for autonomous driving in unpredictable environments as it ensures strategic decision-making based on potential hazards. To achieve this we require a rich PC-VAE latent space, high-quality novel view synthesis, and auto-regressive probabilistic predictions of latents at future timestamps. We evaluate CARFF on a simple synthetic blender-based dataset and each CARLA-based dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Evaluation on blender dataset:In Fig. 5, for both Scene 1a and 1b, our model correctly forecasts the lateral movement of the cylinder to be in either position approximately 50% of the time, considering a left viewing angle. In Scene 2, with the absence of the red cylinder in the input camera angle, the model predicts the potential existence of the red cylinder approximately 50% of the time, and predicts lateral movements with roughly equal probability. This validates PC-VAE\'s ability to predict and infer from the occluded in the latent space, consistent with human intuitions. Similar intuitions, demonstrated within the simple scenes of the Blender dataset, can be transferred to driving scenarios simulated in our CARLA datasets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'PC-VAE performance and ablations:We evaluate the performance of PC-VAE on CARLA datasets with multiple encoder architectures. We show that PC-VAE effectively reconstructs complex environments involving variable scenes, actor configurations, and environmental noise given potentially partially observable inputs (see Fig. 9). We calculated an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) over the training data, as well as novel view encoder inputs. To evaluate the quality of the latent space generated by the encoder, we utilize t-SNE [47] plots to visualize the distribution of latent samples for each image in a given dataset (see Appendix E). We introduce a Support Vector Machine (SVM) [13] based metric to measure the visualized clustering quantitatively, where a higher value indicates better clustering based on timestamps. Most latent scene samples are separable by timestamps, which indicates that the latents are view-invariant. Samples that are misclassified or lie on the boundary usually represent partially or fully occluded regions. This is desirable for forecasting, as it enables us to model probabilistic behavior over these samples. In this process, balancing KL divergence weight scheduling maintains the quality of the PC-VAE\'s latent space and reconstructions (see Appendix C). The results presented in Tab. 2 substantiate the benefits of our PC-VAE encoder architecture compared to other formulations. Specifically, a non-conditional VAE fails in SVM accuracy as it only reconstructs images and does not capture the underlying 3D structures. Vanilla PC-VAE and PC-VAE without freezing weights require careful fine-tuning of several hyper-parameters and don\'t generalize well to drastic camera movements. Our experiments show that our proposed model is capable of sustaining stochastic characteristics via latent representations in the presence of occlusion, while simultaneously ensuring precise reconstructions.\n' +

Each of the \\(K\\) Gaussians is a latent distribution that may correspond to different beliefs at the next timestamp. The mixture of Gaussians is sampled repeatedly for the predicted latent beliefs, visualized as \\(I_{c^{\\prime},scn^{\\prime}}^{t+1}\\), representing potentially the \\(i\\)th possible outcome. This is used to condition the NeRF to generate 3D views of the scene. To accomplish autoregressive predictions, we probe the NeRF for the location of the car and feed this information back to the pre-trained encoder to predict the scene at the next timestamp.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Inference under full and partial observations:Under full observation, we use MDN to predict the subsequent car positions in all three datasets. PSNR values are calculated based on bird-eye view NeRF renderings and ground truth bird-eye view images of the scene across different timestamps. In Tab. 1 we report the PSNR values for rendered images over the predicted posterior with the ground truth images at each timestamp. We also evaluate the efficacy of our prediction model using the accuracy curve given in Fig. 8. This represents CARFF\'s ability to generate stable beliefs, without producing incorrect predictions, based on actor(s) localization results. For each number of samples between \\(n=0\\) to \\(n=50\\), we choose a random subset of \\(3\\) fully observable ego images and take an average of the accuracies. In scenarios with partial observable ego-centric images where several plausible scenarios exist, we utilize recall instead of accuracy using a similar setup. This lets us evaluate the encoder\'s ability to avoid false negative predictions of potential danger.\n' +

      'Fig. 8 shows that our model achieves high accuracy and recall in both datasets, demonstrating the ability to model state uncertainty (Approaching Intersection) and dynamic uncertainty (Two Lane Merge).

      '\n' +
      'To design an effective controller, we need to find a balance between accuracy and recall (see Fig. 8). A lowered accuracy from excessive sampling means unwanted randomness in the predicted state. However, taking insufficient samples would generate low recall i.e., not recovering all plausible states. This would lead to incorrect predictions as we would be unable to account for the plausible uncertainty present in the environment. To find a balance, we design an open-loop planning controller opting for a sampling strategy that involves generating \\(n=2,10,35\\) samples, where \\(n\\) is a hyperparameter to be tuned for peak performance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For sampling values that lie on the borders of the accuracy and recall margin, for example, \\(n=2\\) and \\(35\\), we see that the CARFF-based controller obtains lower success rates, whereas \\(n=10\\) produces the best result. Across the two datasets in Tab. 3, the overconfident controller will inevitably experience collisions in case of a truck approaching, since it does not cautiously account for occlusions. On the other hand, an overly cautious approach results in stasis, inhibiting the controller\'s ability to advance in the scene. This nuanced decision-making using CARFF-based controller is especially crucial in driving scenarios, as it enhances safety and efficiency by adapting to complex and unpredictable road environments, thereby fostering a more reliable and human-like response in autonomous vehicles.\n' +

      '## 5 Discussion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Limitations:Like other NeRF-based methods, CARFF currently relies on posed images of specific scenes such as road intersections, limiting its direct applicability to unseen environments. However, we anticipate enhanced generalizability with the increasing deployment of cameras around populated areas, such as traffic cameras at intersections. Additionally, handling very complex dynamics with an extremely large number of actors still poses a challenge for our method, requiring careful fine-tuning to balance comprehensive dynamics modeling against accuracy. Potentially stronger models in the near future may offer a promising avenue for further enhancements in this regard.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Conclusion:We presented CARFF, a novel method for probabilistic 3D scene forecasting from partial observations. By employing a Pose-Conditional VAE, a NeRF conditioned on the learned posterior, and a mixture density network that forecasts future scenes, we effectively model complex real-world environments with state and dynamics uncertainty in occluded regions critical for planning. We demonstrated the capabilities of our method in realistic autonomous driving scenarios, where, under full observations, we can forecast into the future providing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions of the environment, while we maintain complete recall of potential hazards given incomplete scene information. Overall, CARFF offers an intuitive and unified approach to perceiving, forecasting, and acting under uncertainty that could prove invaluable for vision algorithms in unstructured environments.\n' +

      'Figure 8: **Multi-Scene dataset accuracy and recall curves from predicted beliefs. We test our framework across \\(n=1\\) and \\(n=50\\) samples from MDN’s predicted latent distributions from ego-centric image input. Across the number of samples \\(n\\), we achieve an ideal margin of belief state coverage generated under partial observation (recall), and the proportion of correct beliefs sampled under full observation (accuracy). As we significantly increase the number of samples, the accuracy starts to decrease due to randomness in latent distribution resampling.**\n' +

      'In this section, we draw a comparison between CARFF and other methods that perform tasks similar to our model. However, these methods do not precisely align with the objectives we aim to achieve. For instance, while some methods integrate 3D reasoning, others may omit this aspect. To establish a fair comparison between our model and current methods, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of their qualitative differences, as delineated in Tab. 4. We primarily compare to other NeRF works based on their ability to model uncertainty (state and dynamics) and perform forecasting in the environment. Our work surpasses all the listed previous works and is on par with 2D-based forecasting approaches in functionality [25]. This comparison highlights that our model comprehensively encompasses the key qualitative factors that should be present to reason from the occluded as humans do.\n' +

      'Architecture:We implement PC-VAE on top of a standard PyTorch VAE framework. The encoder with convolutional layers is replaced with a single convolutional layer and a Vision Transformer (ViT) Large 16 [9] pre-trained on ImageNet [36]. We modify fully connected layers to project ViT output of size \\(1000\\) to mean and variances with size of the latent dimension, 8. During training, the data loader returns the pose of the camera angle represented by an integer value. This value is one-hot encoded and concatenated to the re-parameterized encoder outputs, before being passed to the decoder. The decoder input size is increased to add the number of poses to accommodate the additional pose information.\n' +

      'Optimization:We utilize a single RTX 3090 graphics card for all our experiments. The PC-VAE model takes approximately \\(22\\) hours to converge using this GPU. During this phase, we tune various hyperparameters including the latent size, learning rate and KL divergence loss weight to establish optimal training tailored to our model (see Tab. 5). In order to optimize for the varied actor configurations and scenarios generated within the CARLA [8] simulator, we slightly adjust hyperparameters differently for each dataset.\n' +

      'The learning rate (LR) and KL divergence (KLD) weight are adjusted to find an appropriate balance between the effective reconstruction of pose conditioning in the latent space, and the regularization of latents. Regularization pushes the latents toward Gaussian distributions and keeps the non-expressive latents in an over-parameterized latent space to be standard normal. This stabilizes the sampling process and ensures stochastic behavior of latent samples in case of occlusion. To achieve this balance, we use a linear KLD weight scheduler, where the weight is initialized at a low value for KLD increment start epoch (see Tab. 5). This allows the model to initially focus on achieving highly accurate conditioned reconstructions. The KLD weight is then steadily increased until KLD increment end epoch is reached, ensuring probabilistic behavior under partial observability.\n' +

      'Architecture:The shared backbone simply contains \\(2\\) fully connected layers and rectified linear units (ReLU) activation with hidden layer size of \\(512\\). Additional heads with \\(2\\) fully connected layers are used to generate \\(\\mu_{i}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{i}^{2}\\). The mixture weight, \\(\\pi_{i}\\), is generated from a \\(3\\) layer MLP network. We limit the number of Gaussians, \\(K=2\\).\n' +

      'Optimization:We train our network for \\(30,000\\) epochs using the batch size of \\(128\\) and an initial LR of \\(0.005\\), and apply LR decay to optimize training. This takes approximately \\(30\\) minutes to train utilizing the GPU. During training, the dataloader outputs the means and variances at the current timestamp and indexed view, and the means and variances for the next timestamp, at a randomly sampled neighboring view. This allows the MDN to learn how occluded views advance into all the possible configurations from potentially unoccluded neighboring views, as a mixture of Gaussian.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'At each iteration, the negative log-likelihood loss is computed for \\(1000\\) samples drawn from the predicted mixture of distributions \\(q_{\\phi}^{\\prime}(z_{t}|I_{c}^{t-1})\\) with respect to the ground truth distribution \\(q_{\\phi}(z_{t}|I_{c}^{t})\\). While the MDN is training, additional Gaussian noise, given by \\(\\epsilon\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})\\), is added to the means and variances of the current timestamp \\(t-1\\), where \\(\\sigma\\in[0.001,0.01]\\).

      '**Optimization:** Empirically, we observe that it is essential to train the NeRF such that it learns the distribution of scenes within the PC-VAE latent space. Using only pre-defined learned samples to train may run the risk of relying on non-representative samples. On the other hand, direct resampling during each training iteration in Instant-NGP may lead to delayed training progress, due to NeRF\'s sensitive optimization. In our optimization procedure, we use an LR of \\(0.002\\) along with an LR decay and start with pre-defined latent samples. Then we slowly introduce the re-sampled latents. We believe that this strategy progressively diminishes the influence of a single sample, while maintaining efficient training. Based on our observations, this strategy contributes towards Instant-NGP\'s ability to rapidly assimilate fundamental conditioning and environmental reconstruction, while simultaneously pushing the learning process to be less skewed towards a single latent sample.\n' +

Fig. 12 shows that the distributions of the latent samples for the Multi-Scene Two Lane Merge dataset are separable. While t-SNE is good at retaining nearest-neighbor information by preserving local structures, it performs weakly in preserving global structures. Therefore, t-SNE may be insufficient in capturing the differences in distributions for all our datasets.\n' +

The values are calculated and displayed for all three datasets. In Tab. 7, images are marked as either toggled (\\(\\tilde{I}_{t_{i}}\\)) or predicted (\\(\\hat{I}_{t_{i}}\\)). Toggled images in the table cannot be predicted deterministically due to it being the first timestamp in the dataset, or the state of the previous timestamps across scenes being the same in case of dynamics uncertainty. Due to the same reason, in the Multi-Scene Two Lane Merge Dataset, there are additional bolded PSNR values for the pairs \\((I_{t_{1}},\\tilde{I}_{t_{4}})\\) and \\((I_{t_{4}},\\tilde{I}_{t_{1}})\\).\n' +
