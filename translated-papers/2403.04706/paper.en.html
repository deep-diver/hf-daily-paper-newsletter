      '\n' +
      'Mathematical capabilities were previously believed to emerge in common language models only at a very large scale or require extensive math-related pre-training. This paper shows that the LLaMA-2 7B model with common pre-training already exhibits strong mathematical abilities, as evidenced by its impressive accuracy of 97.7% and 72.0% on the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks, respectively, when selecting the best response from 256 random generations. The primary issue with the current base model is the difficulty in consistently eliciting its inherent mathematical capabilities. Notably, the accuracy for the first answer drops to 49.5% and 7.9% on the GSM8K and MATH benchmarks, respectively. We find that simply scaling up the SFT data can significantly enhance the reliability of generating correct answers. However, the potential for extensive scaling is constrained by the scarcity of publicly available math questions. To overcome this limitation, we employ synthetic data, which proves to be nearly as effective as real data and shows no clear saturation when scaled up to approximately one million samples. This straightforward approach achieves an accuracy of 82.6% on GSM8K and 40.6% on MATH using LLaMA-2 7B models, surpassing previous models by 14.2% and 20.8%, respectively. We also provide insights into scaling behaviors across different reasoning complexities and error types.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Mathematical capabilities have long been considered so challenging that they are thought to emerge in common language models only at a very large scale. For instance, studies by (Wei et al., 2022, 2020) suggest that only models with size exceeding 50 billion parameters can attain meaningful accuracy or benefit from chain-of-thought processing on math problems. A strategy to equip smaller language models with mathematical abilities involves creating math-specific base models trained on hundreds of billions of math-related pre-training data (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Azerbayev et al., 2023). However, the accuracy of such models remains modest; for example, Lemma-7B (Azerbayev et al., 2023) only achieves 36.4% on the GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021) and 18.0% on the MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we demonstrate that common language models of small size, such as the LLaMA-2 7B model (Touvron et al., 2023), already possess strong mathematical capabilities without specific pre-training on math-related data. Surprisingly, we find that with supervised fine-tuning on just thousands of math questions (noting that the SFT stage does not enhance capabilities as stated in\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: The orange star markers represent the accuracy achieved by selecting the best response from 256 random generations of the LLaMA-2 7B model. The high accuracy on the MATH (left) and GSM8K (right) benchmarks (72.0% and 97.7%, respectively) suggest that the LLaMA-2 7B already possesses strong mathematical capabilities, although the stability in generating correct answers could be enhanced. This paper demonstrates that by scaling synthetic SFT data, the stability can be significantly improved as evidenced by the curves. Through this straightforward scaling of SFT data, the top-performing model has exceeded an early GPT-4 model by 10.3% on the MATH benchmark.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '(Bai et al., 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022)), the model can correctly solve 97.7% of GSM8K questions and 72.0% of MATH questions, when selecting the best answer from 256 random generations, as indicated by the orange star marks in Figure 1. It is noteworthy that the accuracy has even outperformed those reported for the GPT-4 model, which achieved 92.0% on GSM8K and 42.5% on MATH 1. Therefore, we conclude that the LLaMA-2 7B model has indeed developed strong mathematical capabilities. The primary issue is the lack of guarantee that the correct answer will be digged out, as most generations are incorrect. In fact, the accuracy drops to 49.5% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH if we consider only one random generation per question. We refer to this as the _instability issue_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: The accuracy numbers are reported in the GPT-4 technical report (OpenAI, 2023b). GPT-4 models are continuously being improved. The latest GPT-4 Turbo (1106) API has increased accuracy to 94.8% on GSM8K and 64.5% on MATH. However, the LLaMA-2 7B model using the best of 256 generations still outperforms the latest GPT-4 models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To address the instability issue, we first observe that the accuracy improves almost in linear or even super-linear with exponentially increased supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Moreover, we note that the accuracy is far from reaching a plateau when utilizing all available GSM8K and MATH training data (as shown in Table 1). This observation encourages us to further scale up the SFT data. However, we face a challenge as there is a lack of publicly accessible real data to support this continuous scaling.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To overcome this limitation, we turn to synthetic data, employing a prestigious language model, namely GPT-4 Turbo, to produce synthetic math questions. We find that a straightforward "brand-new" generation strategy, which prompts the GPT-4 Turbo to create a completely new question based on preference ones and then applies a simple verifier (also GPT-4 Turbo based), has been highly effective. Specifically, as indicated in Table 1, the use of synthetically generated math questions can achieve accuracy nearly on par with that of real questions, highlighting the potential of synthetic SFT math questions for the scaling purpose.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Leveraging synthetic data has allowed us to scale our SFT data significantly, for instance, from 7.5K to 960K on GSM8K and from 7.5K to 480K on MATH. This data scaling shows nearly perfect scaling behavior, as drawn in Figure 1. Specifically, by simply scaling the SFT data, our model has become the first to exceed 80% and 40% accuracy on GSM8K and MATH, respectively, using a standard LLaMA-2 7B base model (achieving 82.6% and 40.6% respectively)2.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 2: Concurrently, DeepSeek-MATH-7B (Shao et al., 2024) also surpasses 80% accuracy. However, their approach relies on a much stronger base model extensively pre-trained on math-related corpora and a sophisticated RL algorithm. Our results are complementary to theirs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The straightforward synthetic SFT data proves effective from stronger base models as well, such as LLaMA-2 7OB, which achieves 90.6% on GSM8K and 52.8% on MATH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source model to exceed 90% accuracy on GSM8K. It is also the first open-source model to outperform GPT-4 (i.e., GPT-4-0314) on the MATH benchmark, demonstrating the efficacy of our simple synthetic scaling method.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to the strong results, we have also gleaned insights into the effectiveness of our approach: 1) As the scale of SFT data increases, the model\'s accuracy tends to plateau when utilizing 256 attempts; however, there is a marked increase using 1 response. This indicates that while the model\'s upper capability limit remains fairly constant, the performance gains are primarily due to enhanced stability in generating correct answers. 2) The accuracy of solving math problems follows a power law with respect to the number of chain-of-thought (CoT) steps with different SFT data quantities. An expanded SFT dataset improves the reliability of each reasoning step. Further increasing the proportion of training samples with longer CoT steps through resampling can significantly improve the accuracy of the model for difficult questions. 3) An analysis of error types during the scaling process reveals that calculation errors are more readily mitigated compared to reasoning errors.\n' +

      '## 2 Examine Math Capability of Language Models\n' +
      '\n' +
      'MetricsWe employ two metrics to examine the math capabilities of language models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\begin{table}\n' +
      '\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \\hline \\hline Data size & GSM8K-real & GSM8K-syn & MATH-real & MATH-syn \\\\ \\hline\n' +
      '0.94K & 26.7 & 25.9 & 4.2 & 3.9 \\\\\n' +
      '1.88K & 32.8 & 31.9 & 5.6 & 4.9 \\\\\n' +
      '3.75K & 43.3 & 42.2 & 6.6 & 6.0 \\\\\n' +
      '7.50K & 50.2 & 49.5 & 8.4 & 7.9 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n' +

      'Table 1: Comparison of SFT data scaling with real versus synthetic math questions. It reveals that synthetic math questions are nearly as effective as real ones.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The first is a Pass@N metric\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{Pass@N}=\\operatorname*{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\text{Problems}}\\left[\\min(c,1)\\right], \\tag{1}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'where \\(c\\) represents the number of correct answers out of \\(N\\) responses. This metric considers a question to be solved if at least one correct answer is produced from \\(N\\) random generations. We employ this metric to reflect the potential or capability of a model in solving a math question. To enhance the diversity of the \\(N\\) generations, we set the temperature of the generation process to 0.73.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 3: It is worth noting that most math models utilize a greedy generation strategy with the temperature set to 0. However, the impact of this difference is minimal.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The second is a PassRatio@N metric\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\text{PassRatio@N}=\\operatorname*{\\mathbb{E}}_{\\text{Problems}}\\left[\\frac{ c}{N}\\right], \\tag{2}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'which measures the percentage of correct answers within the \\(N\\) generated answers. This metric is somewhat equivalent to Pass@1, but with reduced variance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ObservationsBased on these two metrics, we examine the performance of the LLaMA-2 models on the GSM8K and the MATH benchmarks4 as shown in Figure 1. To adapt models for these two benchmarks in instruction-following settings, we use their SFT versions, which are trained with a limited amount of SFT data (i.e., 7.5K). As demonstrated in Bai et al. (2022); Ouyang et al. (2022), the SFT stage does not enhance capabilities (and may even lead to a reduction, as mentioned in the context of "alignment taxes"). Therefore, employing the SFT version provides a fair assessment of the models\' mathematical capabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 4: Following Lightman et al. (2023), we utilize a subset of 500 test samples from the MATH benchmark for experimental efficiency.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We first observe that the Pass@256 metrics for the LLaMA-2 7B model on both benchmarks are remarkably high: 97.7% on GSM8K and 72.0% on MATH. This suggests that the LLaMA-2 7B model possesses a strong capability for solving mathematical problems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We then notice that the PassRatio@256 is significantly lower than that of Pass@256, being 48.2% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH. This suggests that while the correct answers to most math questions are present within 256 random generations, there is no assurance that the correct answers will consistently be extracted, a phenomenon we refer to as an "instability issue".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In the following, we will present a simple approach to significantly reduce the _instability issue_.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Scaling SFT Data using Synthetic Math Questions\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we first demonstrate that scaling up the limited real SFT data can significantly alleviate the instability issue. We also observe that the accuracy has not yet plateaued when using the full available GSM8K and MATH training data. We consider further scaling up SFT data using synthetic math questions. To this aim, we introduce a straight-forward method for synthetic data generation utilizing the GPT-4 Turbo API. The synthetic data proves to be as effective as real math questions. Consequently, we boldly scale the synthetic SFT data to 960K on GSM8K and 480K on MATH, respectively, resulting in nearly perfect scaling behavior, and reach state-of-the-art accuracy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scaling using Real Math QuestionsWe begin by examining the scaling behavior of real math questions across the entire GSM8K and MATH training sets. As indicated in Table 1, we observe a consistent accuracy improvement, increasing from 26.7% to 50.2% on GSM8K, and from 4.2% to 8.4% on MATH, with no signs of saturation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Synthetic SFT Data GenerationSince the real data has been exhausted, we contemplate further scaling up SFT data using synthetically generated math questions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We introduce a straightforward three-step approach with the assistance of the GPT-4 Turbo API:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Step 1. Generate a new math question. We request the GPT-4 Turbo API to generate a brand-new question using a reference math question as a starting point. To improve the validity of the new questions, we incorporate three rules into the prompt: Firstly, the new question must obey common knowledge; secondly, it should be solvable independently of the original question; and thirdly, it must not include any answer responses. Besides, we have set specific formatting requirements for questions and answers tailored to various target datasets.\n' +
      '* Step 2. Verify the question. We further enhance the quality of the generated questions by validating and refining them through attempted solutions. By integrating solving and verification steps into a single prompt, we have found that this approach consistently elevates the validity of questions across different benchmarks.\n' +
      '* Step 3. Generate chain-of-thought (CoT) answers. We request GPT-4 Turbo to produce a chain-of-thought (CoT) answer response for each newly generated question.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The detailed prompt designs are shown in Appendix A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Comparison of Synthetic SFT Data versus Real DataTo assess the quality of the synthetically generated math questions, we evaluate their effectiveness against real questions from the GSM8K and MATH training sets, utilizing a LLaMA-2 7B model, as detailed in Table 1. The results indicate that the synthetic math questions are nearly as effective as the real ones.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We also explored various other synthetic methods as proposed in previous works Xu et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2023); An et al. (2023). These methods also prove to be effective, though marginally less so than the our approach, as illustrated in Figure 6.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scaling to about a Million SFT Math Data Considering the effectiveness of the synthetic approach, we substantially increase the scale of the SFT data for both GSM8K and MATH problems, to 960K and 480K, respectively. Figure 1 presents the main results utilizing various sizes of the LLaMA-2 series. The straightforward scaling strategy yields state-of-the-art accuracy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is also worth noting that the accuracy has not yet reached its peak. Exploring the effects of additional scaling will be left as our future research.\n' +

      '## 4 Experiments\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Datasets and Evaluations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We conduct experiments on 5 benchmarks to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**GSM8K**Cobbe et al. (2021). This is a high-quality, linguistically diverse math dataset, whose math knowledge mainly covers grade school level. It includes 7,473 training examples and 1,319 test cases. In this work, we use its training set as the given questions to generate new synthetic data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**MATH**Hendrycks et al. (2021). This dataset focuses on competitive-level math problems that requires high levels of reasoning ability and mathematical knowledge. It consists of 7,500 training examples and 5,000 test cases. We use the training examples to generate synthetic data.\n' +

      '**SVAMP**Patel et al. (2021). This dataset comprises elementary-level math problems. We utilize all 1,000 of its test cases to assess the cross-dataset performance of our models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**ASDiv**Miao et al. (2021). This dataset contains a set of math problems with diverse language patterns and types of questions. We adopt the test set of 2,305 problems as evaluation benchmark.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Hungarian National High School Exam** This evaluation benchmark is first introduced by Grok-1 (xAI, 2023), which is designed for evaluating the out-of-domain capability of math models. It consists of 33 challenging problems.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'It is worth noting that the final answers of Hungarian National High School Exam dataset is annotated by human, while other benchmarks are labelled using automatic scripts, similar to previous works Luo et al. (2023); Gou et al. (2023).\n' +

      'For supervised fine-tuning, we employ the Adam optimizer with a cosine learning rate schedule spanning a total of 3 epochs of training. The maximum learning rate is set 2e-5 (except that 2e-6 for the Mistral-7b model) and there is a 4% linear warm-up. The maximum token length is set 2048, and the Vicuna-v1.1 Zheng et al. (2023) system prompt is used. All experiments are conducted on 8\\(\\times\\)Nvidia H100 GPUs. Our most resource-intensive experiment, involving a 70B model and 960K data points, takes 1900 H100 GPU hours.\n' +

      'In this comparison, we examine both in-domain benchmarks, GSM8K/MATH, and out-of-domain benchmarks, such as the Hungarian National High School Exam. For in-domain evaluation of each benchmark, we utilize data synthesized from its respective training samples. For GSM8K, 960K synthetic data is employed, while for MATH, 480K synthetic data is used. For out-domain evaluation,we test models trained using GSM8K, MATH, or a mixed of two synthetic sets.\n' +

      'For base models, we consider both common language models, i.e., LLaMA-2 7B/13B/70B/Mistral-7B, and math-specific models, such as Llemma-7B, to assess the generality of the proposed approach.\n' +

We find that the accuracy of other benchmarks also improves as the amount of data increases for models trained with either GSM8K or MATH synthetic data. We also note that the generalization behaviors differ for GSM8K and MATH models: 1) SVAMP and ASDiv benefit more from GSM8K models than from MATH models. 2) While MATH models perform relatively well on the GSM8K benchmark, GSM8K models perform considerably worse on MATH benchmarks.\n' +

      '### What Happens behind Performance Improvements?\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Pass@256 _v.s._ PassRatio@256 To deepen the understanding behind the performance improvements, we tracked Pass@N metric and PassRatio@N metric under different data size. The results are shown in Figure 3. With very limited synthetic data (_e.g._ 7.5K samples), the Xwin-Math-70B model already has very high Pass@256, indicating the strong ability to generate correct answers through multiple attempts. Meanwhile, the Pass@256 metric only changed slightly with increasing the amount of used data. In contrast, PassRatio@256, which reflects the stability to generate correct answer, increases significantly with the amount of synthetic data, and its growth trend is similar to that of Pass@1. This result confirms our hypothesize that the performance improvements is mainly caused by the better stability in answer generation rather than stronger ability to answer the question.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Estimated Single-step Reasoning Accuracy** Because of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) are adopted in inference, the process of answer mathematical problems is completed by a multi-step reasoning process. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increase in final answer accuracy can be interpreted by the improvement in single-step reasoning accuracy. Based on this assumption, if one question can be theoretically answered by \\(s\\) reasoning steps in CoT, the final answer accuracy can be approximate by the power function of the single-step reasoning accuracy:\n' +

      'set, we generated 256 responses and used the number of steps in the GSM8k test set\'s CoT annotations as the theoretical CoT steps. We draw the curve to show the relationship between the number of CoT reasoning steps and mean final answer accuracy and show the fitted curve based on Equation. 3. We test Xwin-Math-7B models with different synthetic data, and the results are shown in Figure 4. The solid line is fitted using all seven points and Table 4 shows the estimated single-step accuracy when using different amounts of data using all data points, and it can be seen that the single-step accuracy improve significantly with more data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, when we fit based on Equation. 3 to the first four points, as shown in dashed lines, we found that the latter three points were significantly below the curve. We believe this phenomenon may be related to the smaller proportion of more complex problems in the training data. Therefore, we resampled the 960K synthetic data according to the number of sentences in CoT solution. As can be seen from Figure 4 (right), when the proportion of complex problems is increased, the accuracy for simpler problems remains virtually unchanged, but the accuracy for more complex problems can be significantly improved. Moreover, the utilization of data resampling can increase the model\'s PassRatio@256 from 71.1 to 72.8. This experimental result provides new insights into data selection for mathematical reasoning tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition, we further used the GPT-4 Turbo to find the position where the first step in our answer was wrong and normalized that position by the total number of steps in each answer. As the estimated single-step accuracy gets higher, the first error position of the normalization is postponed.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**The Improvement in the Accuracy of Numerical Calculations is More Significant than Logical Reasoning** The performance of the model gradually improves as the synthetic data increases. For a deeper understanding, we analyze the error proportion for different types of errors on GSM8K. We categorized errors into two types: reasoning errors and calculation errors. Reasoning errors primarily encompass issues such as loss of conditions and concept confusion, while calculation errors include incorrect analysis of quantitative relationships and numerical computation mistakes. Based on the experimental results illustrated in Figure 5, we observe a gradual decrease in the percentage of calculation errors, suggesting that GSM8K is correcting calculation errors at a faster rate than reasoning errors.\n' +

However, as the data size increases, our method and the method with added constraints show stronger performance. This suggests that the choice of data synthetic strategy becomes more critical as the data size increases, and that some methods can scale the data more efficiently, thus improving the performance.\n' +

      'Large Language ModelsLarge language models Brown et al. (2020); Achiam et al. (2023); Touvron et al. (2023); Tuvron et al. (2023) have made significant achievements, with impressive performance on a wide range of tasks. Currently, closed-source large language models, represented by GPT Brown et al. (2020); Achiam et al. (2023), Gemini Team et al. (2023), Groke (xAI, 2023), and Claude-2 (Anthropic, 2023), are the most advanced models in terms of performance. However, open-source models, represented by LLaMA Touvron et al. (2023), LLaMA-2 Touvron et al. (2023) and Mixtral Jiang et al. (2024), have also progressed rapidly, and have even shown competitive performance with the closed-source models on some tasks. Our work, which aims to improve the performance of open-source LLMs on mathematical tasks by fine-tuning them on synthetic data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Reasoning Framework for Improving Mathematical CapabilityChain-of-thoughts Wei et al. (2022) encourages the LLMs perform multi-step reasoning by specific designed prompts and can improve reasoning performance. Based on this work, many subsequent works suggesting further improvements Fu et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2022); Kojima et al. (2022). The above works focus primarily on how to improve performance through better prompt design or inference strategies without fine-tuning the model, whereas our work focuses on how to improve the model itself, and thus these approaches are complementary to ours.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fine-tuned LLM for MathAnother sort of works Lightman et al. (2023); Luo et al. (2023); Azerbayev et al. (2023); Yue et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2023); An et al. (2023); Li et al. (2023); Gou et al. (2023) try to improve performance directly by training the model on mathematical data. A direct way is to use fine-tuning to improve models. One widely used method is to use synthetic data, which is very close to our approach: MetaMath Yu et al. (2023) presents to bootstrap questions to augment data. LeMA An et al. (2023) collects mistake-correction data pairs by using GPT-4 as a corrector. And MuggleMath Li et al. (2023) augments the GSM8K dataset by incorporating GPT-4 with a series of pre-defined operations. Compared to these synthetic data based efforts, our data synthetic method is much simpler and more scalable due to introduce less prior and constraint.\n' +
      '\n' +

However, the intrinsic reasons behind this scaling effect have not been thoroughly investigated.\n' +

      '## 6 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This study reveals that common 7B language models, such as LLaMA-2 7B, already exhibit strong mathematical capabilities, challenging the previous belief that advanced mathematical reasoning is exclusive to larger, more extensively pre-trained models. By significantly scaling up SFT data, we have markedly improved the stability of the model\'s mathematical problem-solving skills. Our methodology has enabled the Xwin-Math models to reach performance levels comparable to, and in some instances surpassing, those of their larger counterparts. Our analysis also indicates that the enhancements are primarily attributable to heightened accuracy in single-step reasoning and a extra resampling of training data can improve the accuracy of harder questions. Additionally, we see more substantial reduction of calculation errors as opposed to logical reasoning errors. Our research contributes valuable insights into the mathematical capabilities of large language models.\n' +

      'Sufficient Solution and Final Answer\n' +
      '\n' +
      'First, let\'s determine the number of cherry trees Maria has. We are told she has 4 less than a third as many cherry trees as apple trees.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since Maria has 81 apple trees, let\'s find one third of that number:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1/3 of 81 apple trees = 81 apple trees / 3 = 27 apple trees.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Now, since she has 4 less than this amount in cherry trees, we subtract 4 from 27 to find the number of cherry trees:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '27 cherry trees - 4 = 23 cherry trees.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To find the total number of trees Maria has in her orchard, we add the number of apple trees to the number of cherry trees:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '81 apple trees + 23 cherry trees = 104 trees.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The answer is [104].\n' +
