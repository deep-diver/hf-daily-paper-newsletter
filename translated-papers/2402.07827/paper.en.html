      'Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have centered around a handful of data-rich languages. _What does it take to broaden access to breakthroughs beyond first-class citizen languages?_ Our work introduces **Aya**, a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 101 languages of which over 50% are considered as lower-resourced. **Aya** outperforms mT0 and BLORecent breakthroughs in natural language processing (NLP) have been no different, with the instruction-following capabilities of existing open-source models, such as Alpaca [Taori et al., 2023a], Dolly [Conover et al., 2023b], and Vicuna [Chiang et al., 2023], mainly developed for English tasks. Instruction finetuning (IFT) involves curating pairs of _prompts_ and _completions_, and has been shown to significantly improve the helpfulness and general instruction following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) [Anil et al., 2023; Sanh et al., 2022; Sanh et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Iyer et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023d; Chung et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023c; Wang et al., 2022c]. However, a sizable gap between the available amount of instruction prompts for English and all other languages exists. More than 7,000 languages1 are spoken around the world today, but an astounding 73% of popular IFT datasets are primarily English [Longpre et al., 2023b].\n' +

      '\n' +
      'This severe sampling bias in the construction of our datasets violates a key machine learning principle: _your training distribution should mirror the underlying distribution you hope to model in the real world_. The consequence is that recent breakthroughs in NLP have amplified disparities in model performance outside of resource-rich languages. Models perform better on the distribution they are trained to mimic [Kunchukuttan et al., 2021] which often introduces known biases towards languages not included during training [Schwartz et al., 2022; Kotek et al., 2023; Khandelwal et al., 2023; Vashishtha et al., 2023; Khandaker et al., 2023] and critical security and safety flaws for all users [Yong et al., 2023a; Nasr et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023c; Lukas et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023]. A growing divide in the cost of use of technology is emerging as marginalized languages require more tokens and incur higher latency for generations [Ji et al., 2023b; Cui et al., 2023; Ahia et al., 2023],\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: **Aya** involved extensive contributions to both the breadth of IFT training dataset, optimization techniques including weighting of datasets, and introducing more extensive evaluation of performance across varied tasks. **Aya** is built by fine-tuning 13B parameter mT5 model [Xue et al., 2020] using an instruction mixture that includes 101 languages (over 50% of which are lower-resourced). Numbers paired with each dataset denote the number of languages covered.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Bridging this widening language gap and conferring _Multilingual Instruction-Following Capabilities_ is not a trivial problem. Some multilingual abilities can be inherited by pretraining on diverse multilingual data (Brown et al., 2020) -- often described as _surprising_ multilingual abilities noted in finetuned models like PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) or Flan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022) which are not explicitly finetuned to be multilingual (Briakou et al., 2023). However, this was not proven to be competitive with a second direction of _both_ pretraining and instruction finetuning with a multilingual corpus. Pursuing this second approach has been the subject of several recent works (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Shaham et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024) where the persistent struggle to secure comprehensive multilingual IFT datasets remains a fundamental obstacle. This second direction is the focus of our work.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**In this work, we address several core limitations of recent multilingual IFT models in order to reduce their linguistic inequality:** We aim to create a model that performs well on downstream tasks when given prompts in any of the included languages, rather than requiring multilingual speakers to write prompts in English. Our goal is also to greatly expand the coverage of languages to 101, far beyond the current coverage of open-source massively multilingual models such as Okapi (Lai et al., 2023) (25 languages), mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2023d) (46 languages), BLOOMZ (Muennighoff et al., 2023d) (46 languages), and Bactrian-X (Li et al., 2023b) (52 languages). To do so, we embark on an ambitious effort to expand the size of the training corpus as well as the breadth of evaluation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The core contribution of our work, highlighted in Figure 1, is an **open-source multilingual instruction-finetuned LLM with diverse linguistic representation**: the **Aya** model. Our primary contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **Expansion of Language Coverage** We significantly expand the size of available training data to directly address the linguistic inequality of recent NLP development. In comparison to recently proposed multilingual IFT datasets such as xP3 which covers 46 languages and includes 81M data points (Muennighoff et al., 2023d), our **Aya** training mix broadens coverage to 101 languages and is 2.5\\(\\times\\) the size of the original xP3 dataset with 203M data points. Perhaps more significantly, while prior datasets like xP3 remain 39% English, our mix is far less skewed with only 21.5% English. Among the 101 languages covered by **Aya**, 51 are deemed lower-resourced (Joshi et al., 2020).\n' +
      '2. **Broadening Multilingual Evaluation** We extend the axes of multilingual evaluation to cover 99 languages by investing in evaluation across **1)** discriminative **2)** generative **3)** LLM-as-a-judge simulated win rate comparisons, **4)** human evaluation, and **5)** safety evaluations. Across these benchmarks, our **Aya** model demonstrates relative performance gains of **13.1%** and **11.7%** over mT0x2 for discriminative and generative tasks respectively. Human preference evaluations for **7** languages show win rates of **75%** relative to mT0x. Footnote 2: mT0x is a variant of mT0 finetuned on 101 languages using xP3x. Details in §3.3\n' +
      '3. **Data Weighting and Pruning** Our emphasis on only using datasets with permissive licensing results in an over-indexing of academic-style multilingual datasets (Longpre et al., 2023b).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To rebalance the distribution, we explore the benefits of data pruning, removing 19.66% of English instances and 18.25% of multilingual instances based upon human annotations. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablations to explore the role of different data sources by varying the weight of 1) translated data, 2) templated data, and 3) human annotations.\n' +
      '4. **Safety** We implement multilingual safety context distillation as a first step towards mitigating LLM safety concerns multilingually (SS6). This step reduces harmful generations for adversarial prompts by 78-89% as judged by human experts. To further characterize the risk profile of our model, we perform an analysis of toxicity, social bias, and gender bias in models\' generations across 18 languages (SS7).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By releasing the **Aya** model, we hope to empower researchers and practitioners to advance multilingual models and applications. **Aya** model is available with a fully open-source Apache 2.0 License3 here: [https://hf.co/CohereForAI/aya-101](https://hf.co/CohereForAI/aya-101).\n' +

      'To date multilingualism in LLM IFT has been plagued by two challenges: **1)** data scarcity with a lack of language coverage and **2)** the low quality of the existing data. For example, while both xP3 [Muennighoff et al., 2023d] and Flan [Longpre et al., 2023a] include multilingual data, the instructions are still written in English. Furthermore, these datasets are frequently generated using manually curated templates which can result in low prompt and completion diversity [Muennighoff et al., 2023d], which is critical for model performance [Naik et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023e; Lahoti et al., 2023].\n' +

While there is an ever-growing number of datasets that are used to train LLMs and satisfy the above criteria, many of these have inconsistent documentation which can cause legal and ethical issues for practitioners [14]. Given our goal of releasing **Aya** under a fully permissive, open-source approved4 Apache 2.0 License, we place emphasis on data provenance. To the best of our ability, we use license annotations from the Data Provenance Collection [14] to discern which public supervised datasets have been checked for self-reported commercially permissive licenses as well as satisfying our above criteria.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Prompt templates are structured text that transform specific NLP datasets into instruction and response pairs. The primary benefit of templating pre-existing datasets is the ability to transform substantial volumes of text into an instruction-following style through some manual efforts [14]. Nevertheless, there are a few limitations: Curating suitable prompts can be a challenging task and the repetition of the same template multiple times can diminish the diversity of instances. Moreover, creating templates for multilingual datasets requires language-specific knowledge making it less cost-effective.\n' +

      'xP3x DatasetWe introduce and curate xP3x (Crosslingual Public Pool of Prompts eXtended)8 which is an extension of the xP3 [15] collection, increasing size, language coverage, and task diversity: xP3x extends xP3 from 86M examples across 46 languages and 13 tasks to 680M examples across 277 languages and 16 tasks. In this work, we use a subset of xP3x and focus on the 101 languages that mT5 [23] is trained on. We further prune xP3x, with a focus on improved quality and increased generation-length, to a subset with 168M examples across 101 languages and 56 datasets. We describe the pruning procedure below.\n' +

      'Pruning xP3xData pruning can have an outsized impact on quality in downstream performance [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In particular, for IFT datasets, a small subset of higher-quality instructions can greatly outperform a larger volume of lower-quality instructions [1, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Automated methods for pruning and curating datasets are imperfect and can lead to a substantial portion of retained data being noisy and of low quality, especially in a multilingual context [16, 17, 18, 19]. Learning these noisy, low-quality datasets is not desirable and the relatively high cost to encode these examples is a misuse of ca\n' +

      'Figure 2: Pruning statistics across (2a) number of templates and (2b) instances for English-only and multilingual datasets. (2c) shows the average instruction length in characters per instance before and after pruning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'data samples in xP3x through a large-scale _human auditing process_. At least two reviewers inspect every template and recommend templates for removal if they contain (1) instructions paired with very short or empty generations; (2) prompt templates that are slightly edited versions of another prompt template; or (3) samples with grammatical or structural errors. In cases where the two reviewers disagree, a third reviewer breaks the tie. The details of the setup for our review procedure are given in Appendix B.1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2 shows the dataset statistics such as the number of instances and templates together with average instruction length in characters before and after pruning. As shown in the plots, 50.2% of English and 35.9% multilingual templates are removed resulting in a 19.7% decrease in the number of English instances and 18.3% decrease in the number of multilingual instances. As seen in Figure 2c, we observe that after pruning, the remaining data presents a 7.0% increase in average instruction lengths for English instances and a 16.8% increase across multilingual instances. We attribute the pronounced gain in length to the large over-representation in publicly available collections of academic style datasets which contain shorter completions. This is consistent with findings based upon large scale audits of popular IFT collections (Longpre et al., 2023b).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data Provenance CollectionWe use the filter tools from the Data Provenance Initiative (Longpre et al., 2023b) to select additional publicly available supervised datasets with self-reported commercially permissive licenses. We focus primarily on high-resource language datasets that have prompt and task diversity. The final collection is made up of OctoPack\'s cleaned version of Open Assistant (Muennighoff et al., 2023; Kopf et al., 2023), Open Instruction Generalist (Nguyen et al., 2023a), a subset of the Flan Collection (Longpre et al., 2023a; Chung et al., 2022), and Tasksource Instruct (Sileo, 2023). We also filter out datasets derived from our evaluation datasets, or that include the evaluation task categories such as textual entailment, co-reference resolution, and sentence comparison tasks, which we hold out to understand task generalization (SS4). Further, we do not include any code datasets despite the potential benefits of code for natural language performance (Muennighoff et al., 2023b; Soldaini et al., 2024), as our base model, mT5, has not seen any code during pretraining (Xue et al., 2020). To amplify diversity, each dataset is sampled up to a maximum of 20,000 examples. The final collection consists of 1.6M examples out of which 550K are few-shot, and the rest are zero-shot, covering 14 languages and 161 different datasets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Aya CollectionIn addition to using existing instruction datasets such as xP3x, we also use templates included in the **Aya** collection (Singh et al., 2024) in our IFT mixture. The **Aya** collection includes the **Aya** dataset, translated data and templated data. In total, it includes 513 million instances making it the largest open-source multilingual IFT dataset to-date. Here, we introduce the templated data which consists of multilingual, human-curated prompt templates collected from **Aya** contributors. Unlike xP3 (Muennighoff et al., 2023d) that consists of only English templates or their translations, the **Aya** collection includes templates in 74 languages (24 higher-resource, 17 mid-resource, and 33 lower-resource languages) that are all curated in contributors\' native languages. This highlights the value of cooperation between domain experts and community contributors. The prompt templates cover 44 datasets and 14 topic areas. When we restrict to these templates and filter the collection to avoid evaluation set contamination, and to the 101 languages that we train on, the **Aya** collection used for training has 51 languages (21 HR, 11 MR, 19 LR), across 34 datasets for a total of 18.9M samples.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Human Annotations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Getting open-ended instruction data from human annotators is a challenging task. This type of data helps language models understand and follow instructions, making them more engaging, friendly, and polite in conversations. This data is also far more expensive to collect, as it requires human instructions and annotations (Ouyang et al., 2022). This is even more difficult for multilingual data and most efforts to this date have focused primarily on English datasets (Kopf et al., 2023; Conover et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023). Here, we focus on introducing new multilingual human annotations through the **Aya** dataset introduced by (Singh et al., 2024)\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Aya dataset** Through a year-long participatory research initiative conducted in parallel to this work, involving 2,997 participants from 110 countries, researchers coordinated the collection of the largest native speaker IFT dataset, called the **Aya** dataset. In contrast to automatically curated, or templated datasets, the goal of the **Aya** dataset is to include natural and organic examples curated by individuals fluent in their respective languages through original annotations as well as re-annotations of existing datasets, resulting in a culturally aware and meaningful dataset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **Aya** dataset has a total of 204K human-curated prompt-response pairs written by native speakers in 65 languages. We filter for the languages we train on, resulting in 199.5K samples covering 64 languages (22 HR, 12 MR, 30 LR). Wolof was the additional language in the **Aya** dataset that had to be excluded from training.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Augmentation via Automatic Translation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prior work has shown the importance of diverse wording, templates, and task types to aid generalization to different natural inputs (Sanh et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022), and found empirical evidence that translating IFT data can improve cross-lingual generalization (Ranaldi and Pucci, 2023). We therefore explore translation as a data augmentation technique to diversify our data collection accordingly, for covering more languages with a diverse set of dataset mixtures.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We return to the **Aya** collection (Singh et al., 2024), which open-sources translations of widely used English IFT datasets to 101 languages. The **Aya** collection prioritizes datasets for translation based on the richness of task diversity and length of completions. These translations are created with the NLLB translation model (NLLB-Team et al., 2022). The **Aya** collection includes 19 translated datasets covering 101 languages. For our purposes, we only include languages that overlap with the 101 languages used for mt5 pre-training. In total, we include translated data for 93 languages across 19 translated datasets with a total of 22 instruction templates.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While we gain language coverage through translation, we anecdotally also observe the systematic introduction of translation artefacts known as _translationese_(Bizzoni et al., 2020; Vanmassenhove et al., 2021). The exact trade-off between these two effects on multilingual instruction-following performance is not well understood yet, and a complex question to assess empirically (Yu et al., 2022; Dutta Chowdhury et al., 2022). We provide some early guidance towards this with an ablation experiment in Section 5.6.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Preserving Task and Data Diversity** Given that the **Aya** collection includes each dataset inits entirety, we risk overfitting to the tasks and data nuances of translated datasets. To avoid this, we randomly sample a subset of up to 3,000 instances for each language for each dataset to preserve instance-level diversity. This ensures that a different random sample is translated into each language. The only exception is Dolly v2 [Conover et al., 2023b], which contains 15k examples created by Databricks employees that are open-ended and very diverse. Due to the nature of this instruction set we do not sub-sample, resulting in 1.6M translated Dolly instances. Therefore, the final translated instruction mixture includes 7.5M instances from the translated data subset in the **Aya** Collection.\n' +

      'Synthetic IFT datasets comprise instructions sampled from a language model, such as the Self-Instruct dataset [Wang et al., 2023c] generated by GPT-3 [Brown et al., 2020] and the Alpaca dataset [Taori et al., 2023a] generated by GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-0039). Several works apply synthetic data generation to promote reasoning, code generation, and algorithmic skills [Gunasekar et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023b] or to gradually teach an LLM to learn under increasing task complexity [Xu et al., 2023]. Recent work suggests that multilingual synthetic data can also enhance cross-lingual transfer [Whitehouse et al., 2023; Dac Lai et al., 2023].\n' +

We construct and introduce **ShareGPT-Command**, a 6.8M synthetically generated and machine translated dataset in 93 languages. **ShareGPT-Command** combines human annotated prompts from ShareGPT10 with synthetic English completions from Command.11 Command is Coherence\'s flagship text generation model and is trained to follow user instructions and be useful in practical applications. We do not use the original synthetic completions from ShareGPT because they are generated from user-shared conversations with ChatGPT.12 In our emphasis on data provenance, we made this decision to comply with the terms of service of ChatGPT13 which prohibits training on their generations. We note that Coherence\'s terms of use14 also prohibit training on their generations. However, we received a special exception for this research endeavo.15\n' +

      '### Pre-trained Models & Finetuning\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**mT5** We finetune the largest mT5 model [20] which has 13 billion parameters, where 1 billion parameters are used by token embeddings. mT5 is an encoder-decoder transformer that has been pretrained using a sequence masking objective which has been shown to be effective for multi-task finetuning [21]. mT5 is pre-trained on 1 trillion tokens of natural language text covering 101 languages from mC4 [14], making it the open-source generative model with the largest language coverage.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**We note that mT5 is a relatively older model from 2019 and is not as powerful as more recent proprietary and open-source generative LLMs**. However, the main motivation for our selection of mT5 is the number of languages that mT5 covers during pre-training due to the widely documented challenges of adapting embeddings during IFT to languages not seen during the unsupervised pre-training stage [21, 22]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The lack of alternative open-source pre-trained massively multilingual base models is a valuable reminder of the slow pace of multilingual development and the interdependence between final IFT performance with the quality of the pre-trained base. To allow other researchers to experiment with varying the base pre-trained model, we point to the **Aya** dataset and collection release [23] which open sources 513M multilingual instances making it the largest open-source multilingual IFT collection to-date.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Finetuning Configurations** We finetune mT5 models using the Adafactor optimizer [21] with a learning rate of \\(3\\times 10^{-4}\\) and a batch size of 256. We find that using a smaller learning rate compared to \\(1\\times 10^{-3}\\) leads to a better downstream performance, which is potentially due to the diverse nature of our IFT mixture. Both input and target sequence length are set to 1024. We use a cross-entropy loss normalized over the target tokens per sequence first and averaged\n' +

However, we observe a pronounced skew in volume. For example, the overall volume of human annotations relative to the translated and synthetic data is far smaller, comprising a mere 0.7% of the total training budget. Here we ask, given a training budget of 25M instances (30,000 update steps), _what instances should we prioritize?_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our sampling strategy is two-fold:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **Source level sampling:** We assign sampling weights to each of our high-level data sources. We choose the sampling weights to balance instruction-following capabilities across tasks and languages. Table 3 shows our finetuning variants where we assign different weights to each of the data sources.\n' +
      '2. **Dataset level sampling:** We optionally specify dataset weights within a data source, e.g. Dolly-15k and ShareGPT-Command share higher weight than other translated datasets. The rest of the weight is distributed proportionally based on the data size across the remaining datasets within that data source. When we do not specify any dataset level weights within a data source, uniform sampling is used.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The final sampling ablations are shown in Table 3. We group each data source based on type into Human Annotated (HA), Templated, and Translated. Based on these groups, we assign different weighting schemes, considering the number of examples, language coverage and quality of data: (1) **Human Annotation Heavy** which upweights the **Aya** Dataset; (2) **Translation heavy** which upweights the translated sources: **Aya** Translations and ShareGPT-Command; and (3) **Template heavy** which upweights the **Aya** Collection, xP3x, and Data Provenance. If the allocated weight exceeds the number of instances in the dataset, the instances are repeated. Since the **Aya** dataset only includes 199.5k samples (0.7% of our training budget), we only experimented upweighting it up to 25% in Human Annotation Heavy.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The selected baselines cover a range of sizes (13B to 176B), base models (Llama, BLOOM, mT5), languages, and training regimes (SFT, and preference training). Details of each model are below:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **mT0 [46 Languages**; Muennighoff et al., 2023d] Similar to the **Aya** model, mT0 also fine-tunes a pre-trained mT5 models [Xue et al., 2020] using xP3 [Muennighoff et al., 2023d] which consists of data for 46 languages and 13 tasks.17 The shared base of mT5 makes this a useful comparison point to isolate the contribution of the Aya IFT final training mix. However, we note that our goal is to double the coverage of languages -- expanding from the 46 covered by **mT0** to the 101 covered by **Aya** while using the same size of the model base. Footnote 17: We replicated mT0 using xP3 dataset and the original hyperparameters with T5x [Roberts et al., 2022] for our experiments.\n' +
      '* **BLOOMZ [46 Languages**; Muennighoff et al., 2023d] is a decoder-only transformer model based on BLOOM-176 [Scao et al., 2022], and finetuned on the xP3 dataset. BLOOMZ is the largest model that we use to compare our **Aya** model with 176 billion pre-trained parameters relative to the largest **Aya** model at 13 billion parameters.\n' +
      '* **mT0x [101 languages]** To ensure a fair comparison with our **Aya** model which more than doubles the number of languages relative to mT0 and BLOOMZ (46\\(\\rightarrow\\)101), we finetune a new variant of mT5, that we dub **mT0x**. It is trained using the original datasets that are part of the xP3 collection but extended to 101 languages (xP3x). We do not conduct any downsampling of overweight datasets or other forms of filtering for this training.\n' +
      '* **Bactrian-X [52 Languages**; Li et al., 2023b] is a LLaMA-13B model [Touvron et al., 2023a] finetuned on the Bactrian-X dataset which contains 3.4M pairs of instructions and responses in 52 languages. This dataset was automatically constructed by translating the Alpaca [Taori et al., 2023b] and Dolly [Conover et al., 2023a] Datasets using the Google Translate API.\n' +
      '* **Okapi [26 Languages**; Dac Lai et al., 2023] refers to language-specific models based on pre-trained BLOOM-7B [Scao et al., 2022] and LLaMA-7B [Touvron et al., 2023a]. Both base models are individually finetuned on a combination of translated prompts and synthetic data for each language. The dataset contains Alpaca [Taori et al., 2023b] and a 106K generated instruction set using the Self-Instruct [Wang et al., 2022b] framework that is translated into 31 languages using ChatGPT.18 The training regime for each target language involves SFT on translated Alpaca, followed by preference training using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) [Ouyang et al., 2022a] on the translated 106K self-generated instructions. It should be noted that both the **Aya** model and all other baselines considered are not preference-trained. Given the known benefits of preference training [Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2022b], and having language-specific models, we expect Okapi models to be a strong baseline for comparison. Footnote 18: Dac Lai et al. [2023] do not include results of 5 languages that are available in their dataset. For these languages, we use the highest scoring model according to [https://huggingface.co/spaces/uonlp/open_multilingual_llm_leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/uonlp/open_multilingual_llm_leaderboard)\n' +

      'A core limitation of multilingual generative progress has been the lack of comprehensive evaluation suites outside of English. One of our core contributions in this work is to expand the axes of evaluation for multilingual models. Prior work has focused solely on unseen task performance [23, 14], with limited measurement of in-distribution performance. Furthermore, human evaluation is rarely included in evaluation of massively multilingual generative models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Expanding axes of evaluation** To measure our models\' performance on various tasks and many languages, we create a multilingual evaluation suite that expands the axes of evaluation. As models are used for a variety of downstream tasks, there is a desire to understand performance on 1) **completely unseen discriminative tasks** where there is no dataset in the training mixture from the same task categories (zero-shot evaluation), 2) **general purpose language understanding** task using Multilingual MMLU [13] where the dataset is not seen during the training (5-shot evaluation), 3) **in-distribution** tasks by using validation/test splits for the corresponding datasets 4) **human evaluation of preferences** with a consistent group of professional annotators who are compensated to evaluate quality, 4) **LLM simulated win-rates** which allow us to scale beyond the languages in which professional annotators are proficient. Table 4 summarizes the evaluation tasks and datasets, together with their language coverage.\n' +

Including all languages except two lower-resource languages, namely Frisian and Latin. This is a significant improvement relative to 27 languages covered by prior work on massively multilingual models [23]. However, we note that while in absolute terms this is an improvement - the majority of evaluation tasks still cover only 10-15 languages, which are often overlapping and skewed towards higher- or mid-resourced languages, as shown in the 4.

English MMLU contains 13,062 questions consisting of 57 different tasks, ranging in topic from STEM, humanities to the social sciences. Dac Lai et al. (2023) created a multilingual version of MMLU by using ChatGPT to translate the original datasets into 31 selected languages.

FLORES-200 and XLSum expand our evaluation to 99 languages.

      'Beyond traditional NLP tasks, we are interested in evaluating the open-ended generation capabilities of **Aya**, such as brainstorming, planning, and other unstructured, long-form responses. We briefly describe both datasets used for human evaluation and simulated win rates below:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Aya-human-annotated test set** The open-source test set from the **Aya** Dataset (Singh et al., 2024) contains 1,750 original hard-to-obtain native speaker annotations from 7 languages (250 examples each for Arabic, English, Portuguese,Telugu, Turkish, Chinese, Yoruba). This includes languages that are varied in terms of resourcendness, as well as script and language families. We do not include Portuguese and Yoruba in our evaluation since GPT-4\'s (LLM-as-a-judge) performance in these two languages is not reported (Achiam et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**dolly-machine-translated test set**Singh et al. (2024) also propose a held-out test set from the Dolly-15k dataset translated into 101 languages with the NLLB model. This test set consists of 200 prompts curated by multiple annotators to avoid culturally specific or geographic references, intending to minimize estimations of performance that require specific cultural or geographic knowledge.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**dolly-human-edited test set** Given the reliance on a translation model to curate the machine-translated Dolly test set, Singh et al. (2024) also open-source improved versions of the machine-translated test set for 6 languages (French, Spanish, Serbian, Russian, Arabic, Hindi) that were post-edited by humans to correct any possible translation issues. Where possible we report win rates on this smaller subset and only include a small number of additional languages from the wider dolly-machine-translated test set.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.3.1 Human Evaluation Protocol\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For human evaluation, we ask compensated professional annotators for seven languages (Serbian, Russian, Hindi, French, Arabic, Spanish, English) to choose their preferred model completions for the dolly-human-edited test set and original English Dolly test prompts, respectively. Each pair of generations is rated once, ties are allowed but discouraged ("both bad" or "both good"). The annotation instructions are a slight modification of those used in (Boubdir et al., 2023). We use these human preference ratings to quantify relative qualitative differences between models across languages and to ground and validate simulated preferences. Furthermore, we collect qualitative feedback on frequent error patterns or generation artifacts. To establish human label variance measures (Plank, 2022) and to calibrate the LLM-as-a-judge agreements accordingly, we annotate a subset of examples for a subset of languages twice. Details about the annotators, instructions, and the annotation process are given in Appendix E.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 4.3.2 Simulated Preferences\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to human annotators, inspired by recent works (Rafailov et al., 2023; Dubois et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023), we use GPT-4 as a proxy judge. For the evaluation samples, we use the 200-sample dolly-machine-translated test set (Singh et al., 2024) that is held out from the training mixture.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Based on GPT-4 and human annotation language coverage, we measure pairwise win rates between **Aya** models and mT0 and mT0x on 10 languages (English, Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Telugu, Serbian, Spanish, Russian, Hindi, French, and Arabic). These correspond to a mix of higher, mid, and lower-resource categories. The prompt for eliciting GPT-4 preferences is given in Appendix D. For languages where there is dolly-human-edited coverage, we default to these prompts given they have had a professional annotator edit issues introduced by translation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To compare the **Aya** model with Bactrian-X, since Bactrian-X is finetuned using all the Dolly (Conover et al., 2023) prompts translated into 52 languages, we use aya-human-annotated test sets in 5 languages (English, Simplified Chinese, Turkish, Telugu, and Arabic) (Singh et al., 2024) where each language includes 250 prompts.\n' +

Among these baselines, all **Aya** variants and mT0x saw 101 languages during instruction tuning while Bactrian-X saw 52 and mT0/BLOOMZ saw 46.

      'by capacity dilution, we show that this is more an artifact of the data used to cover the additional languages, than sheer model capacity. While xP3x contains a large variety of datasets and tasks, more than 50% of its data comes from just a handful of datasets, namely Wiki-Lingua (Ladhak et al., 2020), MultiEURLEX (Chalkidis et al., 2021), and Flores-200 (Goyal et al., 2022). Although these datasets in xP3x are the main contributors to cover 101 languages, they do not provide a lot of useful information when oversampled. Thus, it is crucial to downsample them and include a larger variety of multilingual datasets in the finetuning mixture in addition to xP3x as we do in the **Aya** model. This is evident by our best **Aya** variant outperforming mT0x by **14.8%** over 101 languages.\n' +

We note that Okapi was benchmarked using 25-shot evaluation whereas we use 5-shot as in the original benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020). Our expectation is that 5-shot is a more difficult benchmark -- given that fewer examples are available. However, we note that the **Aya** model is finetuned using up to 1024 input tokens as in mT5 pretraining, which limits the model performance beyond this sequence length.\n' +

We expect Okapi to be a strong baseline to beat, given it both trains individual models per language and is the only baseline we compare to that is preference-tuned by RLHF.

Figure 6 shows the win rates generated by GPT-4. Indeed, Bactrian-X achieves a higher win rate in English of 60%, however, it significantly falls behind the **Aya** in all other languages with an average win rate of 82% for **Aya** in all other languages excluding English.\n' +

Overall, human raters vote for a "tie" more often than GPT-4 (on average 15% vs 3%): Even though annotators have been instructed to use this label sparingly, they argue that "both bad" is the most appropriate rating when both model outputs are (differently) incorrect or do not answer the prompt. On average, GPT-4 ratings agree with human ratings 70.4% for **Aya** vs mT0x comparisons, and 77.3% for **Aya** vs mT0 comparisons.

Given that **Aya** completions are generally longer than those of mT0 (Figure 7) and mT0x, we must assume that verbosity and salience bias also impact GPT-4\'s ratings to some extent (Zheng et al., 2023; Koo et al., 2023).\n' +

      '**Qualitative Insights** In order to characterize **Aya**\'s absolute generation quality, we turn to observations collected from the professional annotators. Throughout the annotation process, we gather feedback about typical generation flaws, critical errors and surprising artifacts. The most commonly reported issues were that **Aya** generations were repetitive or contained hallucinated "loops" or "drifted off", were semantically incoherent or convoluted, contained grammar mistakes (especially for Russian and Serbian) and weird word choices, were factually incorrect or inaccurate or contradictory, and contained bizarrely consistent artifacts in enumerated lists. In comparison to mT0/mT0x, annotators largely preferred them even if imperfect because they answered the prompt more comprehensively and eloquently, and less nonsensically. Furthermore, mT0 generated English outputs for a couple of Hindi and Arabic prompts, mT0x English for French and Russian, and Bulgarian, Russian and English for Serbian prompts, respectively. We include a more detailed discussion of generation flaws in Appendix E.6.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The type of data that confers these two properties is often different. Multi-task instruction tuning data collate 1000s of tasks together and often target traditional NLP tasks (multiple choice question answering, natural language inference, etc.) more and tend to have shorter/simpler/less diverse instructions and responses -- imagine the difference between "tell me if these two sentences are different" and "write me a story about a princess in a tower." While models trained on these datasets may score strongly at NLP tasks, they are often not preferred by humans for interactions. This tension has been observed by recent work (Ouyang et al., 2022; Iyer et al., 2022; Muennighoff et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We also find in our experiments that high performance in discriminative tasks where the success is measured by _rank classification_,21 does not directly correlate with generation quality in open-ended instructions. As an instance of such cases, mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2023) achieves strong performance in the discriminative tasks, however, it often fails to generate high-quality responses in open-ended instruction as shown in human and simulated preference evaluation (SS4.3). Compared to mT0, the **Aya** model is preferred 89% of the times on average according to simulated win rates for 10 languages. According to human evals, **Aya** model is preferred 80% of the time on average for 6 languages.\n' +

We attribute this to the high proportion of instructions generated using templates from classification tasks in the finetuning mixture of mT0. Generations from mT0 and **Aya** in Table 27 illustrate the extent of length differences for a given prompt.\n' +

      '### Experimental Ablations\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We perform ablations to characterize the effects of **(1)** sampling weights for different data sources in the finetuning mixture, **(2)** the addition of each high-level data source, and **(3)** the size of the model. Each ablation involves finetuning from the pre-trained model base, and hence all ablations require fairly extensive compute resources.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 5.6.1 The Impact of Sampling Weights\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The selection and balance of training data sources play a key role in determining the resulting model\'s capabilities and quality. For instance, prior work has demonstrated the composition of the training data can easily result in trade-offs between performance across different domains (Longpre\n' +

      'et al., 2023c), introduce tensions between performance on more traditional deterministic benchmarks and the fluency expected from open-generation tasks (Wang et al., 2023b), as well as model performance on mono- vs multilingual abilities where adding more languages typically benefits lower resource languages while taking away from dominant languages (Pfeiffer et al., 2022; Ogueji et al., 2022). Here, we first ask _how do the sampling weights for each high-level data source impact the model performance in different multilingual tasks?_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Comparison of variants** Figure 8 demonstrates the percentage performance increase in different tasks compared to mT0x for each weighting scheme used as sampling ratios during finetuning. Similar to the finding described in Section 5.5, the sampling weight that gives the best performance in discriminative tasks is not the best for all generative tasks. Concretely, up-weighting multilingual templates (**Aya**templated-heavy) gives the highest increase in discriminative tasks and multilingual MMLU, however, it falls behind up-weighting translated datasets (**Aya**translated-heavy) in machine translation by a significant margin. To have a complete picture, we also compared these two variants in open-ended generations using aya-human-annotated test set in 5 languages: The translated-heavy variant outperforms the templated-heavy by an average of 47% win rates against 31% win rates of templated-heavy according to simulated preference evaluation. We attribute this difference to the selection of more fluid open-ended datasets as priorities for translation. Based on these results, we use translated-heavy weights as the final **Aya** model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**English composition** The difference between the templated-heavy and translated-heavy also reveals another interesting finding. In the templated-heavy weights, the English percentage is naturally up-weighted to 19.9% while the English corresponds only 8.1% of the translated-heavy weights (see Figure 18). Although all other languages have a lower sampling weight, the templated-heavy **Aya** still slightly outperforms the translated-heavy variant in discriminative tasks (Table 5). This suggests that the templated-heavy variant leverages cross-lingual transfer from English in a relatively higher degree for discriminative tasks. However, this transfer impacts slightly less in the open-ended generations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Limitations to upsampling** For the sampling ablation, among the three weighting schemes, up-weighting the human-annotated dataset commonly gives the lowest average performance in all tasks\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 8: % Performance increase in benchmarks for different data weight ablations compared to the baseline (mT0x) in our evaluation benchmark\n' +
      '\n' +
      '(relative to other **Aya** ablations). Rather than the quality, we relate this to the limited size of this dataset. The **Aya** dataset only includes 199.5K instances, and using a sampling weight of 25% makes these instances seen more than 30 times during finetuning which potentially hurts the overall performance by inviting overfitting.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Contribution of Individual Data Sources\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we seek to understand the contribution of individual data sources, we ask _how does each high-level data source contribute to the overall model performance?_ For this ablation, we train two additional models by incrementally adding new data sources: (1) xP3x + multilingual templates, (2) xP3x + multilingual templates + translated datasets. Figure 9 demonstrates the change in performances by comparing these two models with mT0x (only xP3x) and the **Aya** (xP3x + multilingual templates + translated datasets + human annotations).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Here, the performance increase in discriminative tasks is mainly a result of the first step where the multilingual templates are added and the pruning of the xP3x dataset is also introduced. However, the performance in FLORES (machine translation) is increased mostly after we include the translated datasets in the finetuning mixture. For the increase in open-ended generation performance (measured by simulated preference evaluation) each high-level data source improves performance including the human-annotated **Aya** dataset.\n' +

      'To study the relationship between task performance and the number of model parameters, we perform additional experiments by training and evaluating three models of size 1.2B, 3.7B, and 13B. Figure 10 demonstrates the difference in performance for different model sizes. As expected given prior research (Conneau et al., 2019; Xue et al., 2020; Muennighoff et al., 2023d), there is a clear trend across all task categories that larger models outperform their smaller counterparts. The biggest jump in performance is visible in the average evaluation accuracy of the unseen discriminative tasks (XWinograd, XNLI,\n' +

Given the consistent gains across all tasks, We suspect that even the 13B model is still severely under-capacity, especially considering the number of languages we are attempting to model. This is because, as the number of languages increases, using fixed capacity leads to degradation in the multilingual performance. However, adding more capacity i.e increasing the model size, mitigates the _curse of multilinguality_(Conneau et al., 2019). We were limited in further exploration by the available sizes of T5 family of models (with 13B being the largest available). We invite future research to further explore multilingual scaling relationships.\n' +

      '_Auditur et altera pars. -- Seneca, Medea_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Previous works have found that when safety evaluations and mitigations of multilingual IFT models are focused on English only, these models are prone to safety leaks via other languages (Deng et al., 2023; Yong et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024): model\'s English outputs might be safe, but when prompted for the same contents in another language, the outputs might be unsafe. Therefore, it is necessary that our safety evaluations and mitigations include as many languages as possible. Here, we focus on existing multilingual benchmarks for adversarial user prompts. For each language, we simulate users querying the model with harmful intent, i.e., to obtain information or guidance on how to execute a harmful action. This mimics a specific safety risk scenario of _adversarial use_. The overall goal is to create safety measures that prevent the model from providing such information that could be used to cause harm in any language. Professional-level jailbreak scenarios are out of the scope for this study.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While this gives us an initial, surely incomplete, impression of safety concerns across a subset of **Aya** languages, significant efforts from the wider NLP community are needed to further extend the coverage of safety benchmarks and evaluation metrics across languages, especially with a non-English-centric focus (Talat et al., 2022). The release of the **Aya** model will make community-based redeaming efforts possible, by exposing an open-source massively-multilingual model for community research.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '#### 6.1.1 Mitigation With Preambles\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Previous works introduced safety preambles as a low-cost inference strategy to prevent adversarial misuses or attacks (Askell et al., 2021; Ganguli et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). We conduct preliminary experiments by adding a safety preamble to harmful prompts to test if this approach also works in a multilingual setup. We take inspiration from the critique-and-revise approach proposed by Bai et al. (2022) for a one-step classify-and-reject preamble (see Appendix J.1 for the preamble tuning process): _"Does the following request contain harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, offensive or illegal content or intent? If yes, explain that you do not engage in these type of requests."_ This approach relies on the model\'s ability to detect toxic content across languages, which we analyze in Appendix I.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since the **Aya** model is trained to receive instructions in the target languages, we translate this safety preamble with NLLB to **Aya** languages. When we prepend the preamble to harmful prompts from multilingual AdvBench (Yong et al., 2023a), **Aya** successfully rejects on average 88% of these requests with meaningful refusal messages. Rejections are surprisingly consistent across languages, with the least refusals for Scottish Gaelic (72%) and Hindi (77%) (full results in Appendix J.1).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, using a preamble alone is not a standalone solution for a safe _and_ helpful model, as it is known to encourage rejections even for non-harmful prompts (Touvron et al., 2023b), i.e. respond to harmless prompts in a refusing way. In preliminary experiments, we also discovered that the presence of a preamble that contains a list of undesired attributes of the generation (toxic, harmful, etc), can increase toxicity with open-ended completion prompts (SS7.1.2) as it made it more prone to generate completions discussing violence and crime, as its probability of generating toxic outputs against racial and gender identity groups increases by around 19%.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Therefore, the use of such preamble has to be restricted to harmful contexts, where it can serve as an effective mitigation technique but not affect generation quality otherwise.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Furthermore, we anecdotally observe that the refusal messages often include "I am a LLM trained by Cohere" (in the respective target language). We therefore assume that the **Aya** model gained the ability to meaningfully reject harmful prompts from Cohere\'s Command model, that was used to generate multilingual synthetic data for ShareGPT prompts in the finetuning stage (SS2.4). Given the limitation of preamble mitigation and our observation of distilled safety capability in **Aya**, we hence propose _multilingual safety context distillation_ as our mitigation strategy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### 6.1.2 Safety Context Distillation with Synthetic Refusals\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The idea of _safety context distillation_(Askell et al., 2021b; Ganguli et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b) is to distill safety preambles into the model for safety-relevant contexts, i.e. teaching the model in which contexts refusals are appropriate without having to use a preamble explicitly. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to extend this technique to a multilingual setup. Our goal is to finetune the **Aya** model with distilled refusal prompts across different languages from a teacher model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Instead of (semi-)manually defining refusal templates for specific safety contexts, e.g. uncovered by a red team (Ganguli et al., 2022)--which entails a heavy cost of manually re-annotating responses or curating templates--we generate a synthetic finetuning dataset by relying on a safety preamble to elicit diverse refusals from the model on previously published harmful prompts. We expand the language coverage of these prompts with automatic translation. By doing so, we directly benefit from a model-generated diversity of formulations and input-specific reasoning in the target languages. The generated (safe) responses are then paired with the original prompts (without preamble) for model finetuning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Experimental Setup\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Safety Distillation** We compile a safety distillation training set from multilingual AdvBench (Yong et al., 2023a) (12 **Aya** languages) and the XSafety benchmark (Wang et al., 2023a) (9 **Aya** languages), both of which contain collections of prompts reflecting harmful user intent. We split both datasets into training and held-out test portions, yielding 1360 training prompts per language. For evaluation, we focus on the AdvBench held-out portion of 120 prompts per language. Details are given in Appendix J.2. For the languages not covered by the original datasets, we translate the prompts with NLLB into the remaining target languages as described in Section 2.3. Due to the questionable quality of NLLB translation for some of the considered languages (Robinson et al., 2023), we use them only for training data augmentation and limit our evaluations to the original multilingual AdvBench languages:22 Scottish Gaelic, Ukrainian, Hindi, Thai, Simplified Chinese, Hebrew, English, Bengali, Standard Arabic, Italian, and Zulu. As a teacher model, we deploy an early-stage **Aya** model (**Aya Beta**) with NLLB-translated safety preambles for each language. We sample safety distillation targets for the training set from **Aya Beta** (top-p sampling with p=0.8, temperature=0.9), one for each prompt. This distilled safety data is added to the **Aya** translate-heavy finetuning data mixture (SS3.2) with a weight of 3% (details in Appendix J.3). The mitigated model which we term **Aya Safe**, is finetuned for 30k steps and the last checkpoint is used for evaluation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 22: These are also machine-translated, but with Google Translate, which was reported to perform significantly better on the selected languages (Robinson et al., 2023). To verify the prompt quality, we give human annotators the option to flag incomprehensible prompts, and received zero reports.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Without mitigation, Aya is vulnerable to adversarial prompts across all languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### Human Safety Evaluation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We follow Yong et al. (2023) and define harmful outputs as outputs that engage on-topic with the unsafe inputs (for instance, treating "bomb" as an explosive device and not as a bath bomb) and that provide actionable insights for the malicious goals. Following their evaluation strategy, we ask proficient language annotators to classify the model outputs of the test set for English, Arabic, and Hindi. For each **Aya Safe** or **Aya** model generation annotators are asked to decide whether it is harmful or not, or whether it is nonsensical. With this additional label, we aim to catch those cases where the model is not harmful but also fails to give a comprehensible answer (the _relevance curse_, as coined by Shen et al. (2024)). In addition, annotators are asked to flag bad prompts in case the automatic translation rendered a prompt non-harmful (none of them did). All annotation details are given in Appendix E.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### GPT-4 Evaluation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In addition to human evaluation, we explore the feasibility of evaluating with GPT-4 as a proxy as in previous evaluations on this type of data (Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). This allows us to gauge harmfulness in languages that we do not have professional annotators for, and to study the effect of data weights in an ablation (Appendix J.3). We prompt GPT-4 to judge whether a generation is harmful with the template given in Appendix J.4, similar to (Sun et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). The evaluation instruction is given in English but prompts and completions are given in the respective target languages. For the languages included in human evaluation, we measure that GPT-4 ratings agree on average 93% with human ratings, with a slight tendency to underestimate harmfulness. Details for this comparison are reported in Appendix J.5.\n' +

      '\n' +
      '### Safety Mitigation Results\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 11 compares the ratio of harmful responses on the AdvBench test set as judged by human annotators for Arabic, English and Hindi. The **Aya** model has no mitigation strategies applied to prevent compliance with adversarial prompts, so it is not surprising that it generates harmful outputs for a vast majority of the adversarial prompts across languages, with harmful rates of 89-90%. This rate is almost identical across the three human-evaluated languages. GPT-4 harmfulness estimates are consistently 7-8 percentage points lower, shown in Figure 12. With the wider range of languages evaluated by GPT-4, we find more divergence from this rate, down to 65% for Zulu and 71% for Scottish Gaelic. In contrast to prior reports on multilingual safety (Yong et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023), we find that the **Aya** model is not more prone to safety attacks for languages other than English, as it has simply not been safety-mitigated for any of them. On the contrary, it is less prone to giving factually correct and actionable responses for an adversarial user in languages where its generation capabilities are lower (SS 5.2).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Safety context distillation reduces harm.** Human and GPT-4 ratings (Figure 12) confirm the effectiveness of the multilingual safety context distillation strategy across languages. For the human-evaluated languages, the harmfulness of **Aya Safe** compared to **Aya** is reduced to a range of 4-11%, and for GPT-4 evaluated languages to a range of 1% (English, Chinese) to 10% (Hindi, Gaelic) of adversarial prompts. Hindi is the one with the highest remaining harmfulness after mitigation (11% according to human ratings, 13% according to GPT-4). In general, the harmfulness of the mitigated model (5% on average) is even lower than the one of the teacher model with the preamble (12% on average) for all studied languages, which underlines the advantage of addressing mitigation in the finetuning stage rather than only at inference.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Refusals remain to be improved.** In the human evaluation, only very few outputs (1% for Arabic, 8% for Hindi) were labeled harmless but non-sensical because they were hallucinated or too repetitive. While **Aya Safe** is capable of generating refusal messages in the target language, human annotators noted that the rejections were often very apologetic, repetitive, and not very specific to individual harm cases. This means that the safety mitigation was successful in the sense that it prevents the model from generating harmful responses in almost all cases, but that style, diversity, and conciseness can be improved. Examples are given in Table 26. Preference training could potentially alleviate these issues (Bai et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b), we leave it for\n' +

      '### Trade-offs between Performance and Safety\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Prior work has found that safety context distillation can cause a drop in performance on non-safety-related tasks, reduce helpfulness, and introduce false refusals (Touvron et al., 2023b). Our results largely corroborate this finding: For the general benchmark evaluations reported in Section 5, safety context distillation causes losses of 0.2-3.2 points, shown in Table 8. For toxicity and bias evaluations following in Section 7, however, we will find that this safety measure leads to comparable or marginally improved performance. We suspect that the characteristics of the safety-distilled data that we add to the IFT mixture might be the culprit for lower performance in the general benchmarks: The distilled model responses for harmful prompts are relatively repetitive, not very diverse, and narrow in domain. Depending on the evaluation metric and their sensitivity for these aspects, this might affect some downstream tasks more than others. A stronger multilingual teacher, combined with more diverse prompts might be needed to reduce the risk of reducing overall IFT data quality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Beyond these benchmarks, we are concerned with open-ended generation quality: Of the 200 Dolly-human-edited test set generations, humans prefer the safety-mitigated model outputs on average in 28% of cases and rate them equally good or bad as those of the non-mitigated model in 36%, see Figure 13. While the non-mitigated **Aya** model technically still has the higher win-rates on average (36%), the immense proportion of ties (also 36% on average; up to 59% for Hindi) indicates\n' +

However, we only find one arguably false refusal in both languages (the model refuses to give harmless financial advice).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In light of these results and the immense reduction of harmfulness, we consider that **Aya Safe** is sufficiently safety-mitigated with a small performance trade-off. However, further research is needed to investigate if this trade-off is indispensable or if better compromises can be found, especially in a multilingual setting. It is also important to keep in mind that adversarial use for intentional harm, as mitigated here, makes up only one specific aspect of LLM Safety (Bender et al., 2021; Gallegos et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023), and that safety measures have to get extended beyond that.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The challenges of toxicity and bias evaluation in a multilingual setting are compounded by the lack of reliable evaluation datasets outside a small fraction of languages. For instance, toxicity analysis of open-ended generations has been primarily done on English only, even for multilingual models such as PaLM and GPT-4 (Gehman et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023).

      'In this section, our toxicity and bias analysis covers 18 languages in total, including both mid- and high-resource languages across 5 different language families.

      'In this section, we inspect two evaluation scenarios: introducing "accidental" toxicity in responses to non-toxic prompts (SS7.1.1) and toxicity and bias in prompted descriptions of identity groups (SS7.1.2). For each scenario we follow Pozzobon et al. (2023) and Gehman et al. (2020) and use two metrics to evaluate toxicity, based on the toxicity scores by Perspective API:23\n' +

      'For both metrics, lower is better. Generations are considered toxic if their Perspective API toxicity score exceeds 0.5.

      '\n' +
      'In this setup, we evaluate how toxic model continuations are for non-toxic prompts. We follow prior work Pozzobon et al. (2023) and use a subset of 10k non-toxic prompts from the RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) dataset proposed by Gehman et al. (2020). An example of such non-toxic prompt is "She is full of".\n' +

      '\n' +
      'To extend this evaluation setup to languages beyond English, we translate the 10k sentences with the 3.3B NLLB model, and then split the sentences in half (according to whitespace tokenization) to use the first half as the prompt, following the procedure for English (Gehman et al., 2020). To keep our experiments consistent with Gehman et al. (2020); Pozzobon et al. (2023), we filter out the input prompts that are evaluated as toxic, so that the toxicity evaluation of model generations is only carried out on non-toxic input prompts. We refer our readers to additional details about translation in the Appendix G.1 and Appendix G.2 for toxicity analysis of our multilingual RTP input prompts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Following prior work (Pozzobon et al., 2023; Gehman et al., 2020), we sample \\(k=25\\) model outputs for each non-toxic prompt of each language.

And how does it differ across languages?_\n' +

      '**Comparing toxicity of open-ended generations** As seen in Figure 14, both **Aya** and **Aya** **Safe** models have lower expected maximum toxicity and toxicity probability than mT0x across all 14 languages, which suggests that the generations of both models are less toxic. Both **Aya** model and **Aya** **Safe** are less likely to produce toxic generations than mT0x. Across 14 languages, **Aya** and **Aya** **Safe** have a comparable toxicity level. The average toxicity levels of the "worst-case", i.e. maximum toxicity generations for **Aya** and **Aya** **Safe** are 22% and 24% respectively, and both models have an 8% chance on average of generating toxic completions for the sample size of \\(k=25\\).\n' +

      'We observe that all models have a substantially higher probability of generating toxic outputs in German and Portuguese than other languages (Figure 14b).

An example of such prompts is "All Black women are".\n' +

      'We follow the evaluation protocol in Chowdhery et al. (2022), including using the same set of 28 prompts listed in the PaLM evaluation (Chowdhery et al., 2022), see Table 19 in Appendix H.

      '\n' +
      '**Comparison across demographic subgroups** As seen in Figure 15, we observe that both **Aya** and **Aya** **Safe** models have lower expected maximum toxicity on average than mT0x across all languages except English. Furthermore, **Aya** **Safe** model has a lower probability of generating toxic outputs compared to mT0x and a significantly lower probability of generating English toxic outputs than **Aya**. Note that because we sample a larger number of model outputs per prompt in this setup (800 as opposed to 25 in Section 7.1.1), it is substantially more likely that there is at least one output that is toxic for a given prompt (definition of toxicity probability in Section 7.1). Therefore, the toxicity probability in Figure (b)b is much higher than that in Figure (b)b. Our results in Appendix H.1 where we sample \\(k=25\\) outputs--identical to the setup in Section 7.1.1--shows the toxicity probability distribution across languages that are more comparable to our results in Section 7.1.1.\n' +

Figure 16 breaks down the toxicity analysis across English prompts for racial identity groups and demonstrates that **Aya** tends to generate more toxic English outputs compared to mT0x on Asian people, White men, and Indian men, as the average and maximum toxicity scores are higher than those of mT0x. In the Appendix, we include an extended co-occurrence analysis following prior work [Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022] to further understand implications of this bias. This involved counting the adjectives and adverbs in the model generation for these specific identity group prompts. We refer our readers to Appendix H.2 for our methodology and discussion of the results.\n' +

      'In this section we are investigating inhowfar the models are able to generate translations containing occupations appropriately with the right contexts in gendered language.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Setup** We evaluate gender bias that occurs in translations of different languages [Ahuja et al., 2023] using the Wino-MT [Stanovsky et al., 2019] benchmark. Wino-MT is an extension from the concatenation of Winogender [Rudinger et al., 2018] and Winobias [Zhao et al., 2017] that originally targeted gender and occupational bias within English in the subsequent references. Evaluation is done on sentences containing occupations with pro-stereotypical as well as anti-stereotypical references to gender (male/female/neutral) when the original English sentences are translated by the models (mT0x, **Aya** and **Aya Safe**).\n' +

      '\n' +
      'The WinoMT benchmark provides a balanced set of sentences that contain occupations and genders linked in a pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical manner. When the models are prompted to translate these sentences, ideally the gender related to the occupations should be maintained according to the contexts. This is measured with three metrics addressing the following questions:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Overall accuracy measures the correctness of of gender in the translations, higher is better.--_How accurately are genders translated into each language?_\n' +
      '2. \\(\\Delta S\\) measures the accuracy difference between the pro-stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentences that were translated by the evaluated models, lower is better.--_How sensitive is the accuracy of the gender translation to stereotypes in the context?_\n' +
      '3. \\(\\Delta G\\) measures the F1 score difference between male/female genders in the sentences translated by the evaluated models, lower is better.--_How large is the gap in translation accuracy between genders?_\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Overall Translation Accuracy** Table 9 presents the overall accuracy of the model translations for different languages. We observe a similar range of overall accuracy in **Aya** models and mT0x, where one is marginally better than the other in some of the languages. **Aya Safe** has the highest overall accuracy among the compared models for Romance languages (Spanish, French and Italian) whereas mT0x has the highest overall accuracy for Semitic languages (Hebrew and Arabic).\n' +

      'the evaluated models is presented in Table 10. For the aspect of gender, **Aya Safe** has the lowest \\(\\Delta G\\) in Romance languages and German while mT0x has the lowest \\(\\Delta G\\) in Semitic language. A low \\(\\Delta G\\) suggests that the model is more accurately translating the sentences with female gender since generally the models have the tendency to produce generations with male gender, as illustrated in Figure 17. On average **Aya Safe** shows the most capability among the compared models in such generation. For the aspect of stereotypes, mT0x has the lowest \\(\\Delta S\\) for Spanish, Italian, Ukrainian and German. **Aya Safe** has the lowest \\(\\Delta S\\) for the remaining languages, except for French which is the same for **Aya** and **Aya Safe**. A low \\(\\Delta S\\) means that the model is capable of generating translations that are anti-stereotypical, despite the general tendency to produce pro-stereotypical translations as shown in Figure 17. An example of an anti-stereotypical sentence is "The nurse notified someone that his shift would be ending in an hour." The correct choice of gender (in this case male) in the translations for the occupational term ("nurse") and being consistent in the context while being anti-stereotypical indicates lower bias in the generated translation by the model. In this regard, mT0x achieved the lowest average \\(\\Delta S\\), closely followed by **Aya Safe** with a small margin.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As illustrated in Figure 17, **Aya** exhibit the tendency of translating the sentences into male gender and pro-stereotypical settings, with different degree of variation across languages. All the evaluated models showed similar trend. This is consistent with the reported observation in GPT3 [Brown et al., 2020] where outputs with male identifier tends to be generated.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite having translations that are prone to male gender and pro-stereotypical, **Aya** and **Aya Safe** generate translations with overall accuracy that are higher than mT0x on average. We observe promising signs from **Aya Safe** in terms of overall accuracy and in bridging the gap of disparity between the genders and thus interpreted as having less gender bias in the translation outputs.\n' +

      'Language Diversity in Open-source Multilingual NLPThere are around 7,000 languages spoken in the world, and around 2,500 languages classified as low-resource languages by Joshi et al. (2020) have more than 1 billion speakers. Despite the sizable number of language users, there is scarce coverage of multilingual datasets for supervised NLP tasks. For the task of machine translation, most notable improvements have been achieved with recent work such as NLLB (NLLB-Team et al., 2022), FLORES (Goyal et al., 2021), and Tatoeba (Tiedemann, 2020). These initiatives collectively advance low-resource and multilingual machine translation by open-sourcing models, introducing comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and datasets, and fostering the development of open tools and models across 200 languages, acknowledging the limitation in coverage compared to the diversity of languages worldwide, yet promoting global communication and research in translation. Grassroots organization like Masakhane (V et al., 2020) advanced African NLP efforts in several domains like NER (Adelani et al., 2021, 2022), QA (Ogundepo et al., 2023) and MT (V et al., 2020; Adelani et al., 2022). Other notable initiatives include NusaCrowd (Cahyawijaya et al., 2022) for Indonesian (Winata et al., 2022), Turkic Interlingua (TIL) (Mirzakhalov, 2021) for Turkic Languages (Mirzakhalov et al., 2021), IndicCorp and IndicXtream (Doddapaneni et al., 2023) for Indic languages, Masader (Alyafeai et al., 2021) for Arabic (Altaher et al., 2022) and SEACrowd24 for South East Asian languages.\n' +

      'Pre-trained Multilingual ModelsPre-training a language model involves unsupervised learning on vast amounts of data. While most pre-training has focused on English (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Biderman et al., 2023), there has also been considerable work focused on mono-lingual pre-training outside of English (Faysse et al., 2024; Gutierrez-Fandino et al., 2021; Zeng et al., 2021; Sengupta et al., 2023; Phan et al., 2022; Koto et al., 2020; Ko et al., 2023) or training models on a small set of languages (Nguyen et al., 2023; Mesham et al., 2021; Ogueji et al., 2021; Jude Ogundepo et al., 2022). Here, we are interested in pre-training efforts which are massively multilingual (Xue et al., 2020; Chung et al., 2023; Shliazhko et al., 2022;\n' +

      'Scao et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2022; Devlin et al., 2019; Conneau et al., 2019; Khanuja et al., 2021; Oladipo et al., 2023; Alabi et al., 2022). Models trained on variants of the mC4 corpus (Xue et al., 2020) cover around 100 different languages in significant amounts, which is the broadest coverage currently available for pre-trained models. Among them, mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) and umT5 (Chung et al., 2023) are the largest publicly available pre-trained language models in terms of number of languages covered. We also point to a parallel direction of work that focuses on adapting pre-trained models to new languages than were not present during pretraining. These studies leverage continued finetuning and adaptation of the embedding space. For example, some prior work (Yong et al., 2023; Luukkonen et al., 2023) extends language coverage by adding a single language at a time through continued pretraining on monolingual corpora, which does not scale well. Work concurrent to ours by Lin et al. (2024) covers a more extensive set of languages by employing vocabulary extension and continued pretraining on LLaMA 2 with Glot500-c (ImaniGooghari et al., 2023). A commonality shared by all the approaches above is a focus on pre-training, which makes off-the-shelf usability limited as users have to perform downstream task finetuning themselves. In contrast, this work is focused on conferring instruction following abilities to pre-trained models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Instruction TuningBefore multitask finetuning, significant work focused on finetuning pre-trained models on a variety of languages through data augmentation for a single task (Longpre et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022; 2023; Hu et al., 2020). More recently, finetuning pre-trained models on a large collection of tasks has emerged as a key paradigm to improve their performance and make them more useful Sanh et al. (2021); Wei et al. (2021); Mishra et al. (2021); Min et al. (2021); Ouyang et al. (2022). Task diversity (Longpre et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Chung et al., 2022), complexity (Xu et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023;a) and quality (Zhou et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2023; Zhuo et al., 2024) are three critical axes for successful instruction tuning. Muennighoff et al. (2023) conduct an investigation into the role of multilingual data during instruction tuning. They found that models are capable of solving tasks in languages unseen during instruction tuning and even pre-training in some cases. However, including languages during the training process leads to better performance than solely relying on such crosslingual generalization. Thus, the BLOOMZ (Muennighoff et al., 2023) and mT0 (Muennighoff et al., 2023) models make significant strides in the multilingual capabilities across the 46 languages seen during finetuning. However, their usefulness is limited beyond this set, particularly for lower-resourced languages. While other multilingual instruction models have been proposed since (Li et al., 2023; Lai et al., 2023), there remains significant room for improvements among all new open models (Asai et al., 2022; 2023; Hu et al., 2020; Ruder et al., 2021). Aside from the still limited language coverage, these models often employ English instruction data, and primarily academic tasks that differ from real-world use cases. By releasing a model that has been fine-tuned on many diverse tasks in each target language and tested on open-ended generation across languages, we make a large step toward closing the performance deficit. Aside from the broader language coverage, our work also improves accessibility by training a model that performs well when a prompt is provided in the same target language as the task, as opposed to prior work that explores prompting in a code-switched fashion, which uses English prompt and task information in target language (Fu et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Translation AugmentationTranslation-related augmentation strategies are popular for multilingual tasks. Translate-train, translate-test (Asai et al., 2018; Cui et al., 2019; Jundi and Lapesa, 2022), or language pivots (Montero et al., 2022) are common techniques employing translation models to bridge language gaps between the model and its target language. Back translation (Sennrich et al., 2016; Dhole et al., 2021) is a popular strategy for augmenting training data, but given that our goal is to improve multilingual generation, we simply translated our training datasets into our target languages without translating them back. Our translation augmentation is similar to (Bornea et al., 2021)\'s work, which used machine translation-generated data to increase the size of their training set by a factor of 14. While our work utilized machine translation similarly to expand our English training set, we also leverage human expertise, to perform quality filtering based on feedback from **Aya** community members, and to provide human translations. Machine-translated prompts often lack variability and the cultural nuance inherent in text originally written in the target languages. However, they are still useful for expanding the language coverage of the training data and can help bridge the resource gap for languages with limited training data (Urbizu et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2021). They can also adapt already-trained instruction-tuned language models to follow instructions in new languages (Yong et al., 2023). Furthermore, LLMs trained on designed prompts have also been shown to be successful at tasks like EAE (Event Argument Extraction) from multilingual data in a zero-shot setup (Huang et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) constructed high-quality Chinese instructions from existing English instruction datasets. They first translated the English instructions into Chinese, and then used a human verification process to determine whether these translations are usable; the verified dataset set consists of around 200k Chinese instruction-tuning samples. Li et al. (2023) constructed instruction data for 52 popular languages using Google Translate to translate English prompts and completions from Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) (52K) and Dolly (Conover et al., 2023) (15K) dataset, then used these data to finetune LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) using the LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) technique. BayLing (Zhang et al., 2023) prompted LLMs to translate a task request, which is overlaid with the more granular user-based corrects. This process naturally connects different languages as well as human preferences with LLMs, leveraging LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) for foundational support and employing automatic construction of interactive translation instructions for instructional tuning, thereby enhancing the model\'s multilingual capability and alignment with diverse linguistic needs.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Dataset WeightingAs for dataset balancing, there are a variety of prior works, including Xie et al. (2023); Muennighoff et al. (2023); Longpre et al. (2022) which dynamically select pretraining or finetuning data from across domains, for more efficient and performant target results. Separately, Dou et al. (2020) dynamically selects and weights training data for back-translation. In the multilingual setting specifically, Wang et al. (2020) proposed using MultiDDS, which is based on (Wang et al., 2020)\'s Differentiable Data Selection, that optimizes a language score to adapt to multiple model objectives in a multilingual training context. Closely intertwined with this, data pruning is a research domain focusing on selecting a subset of data based on specific criteria. Previous works have studied metrics such as perplexity and error norms as selection criteria for filtering data (Wenzek et al., 2019; Laurencon et al., 2022) and finetuning LLMs (Paul et al., 2023; Marion et al., 2023). Prioritizing data instances that most effectively distinguish between models has also been effective in reducing the required human effort for annotation (Boubdir et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Evaluation of Toxicity and Bias in LLMsBias evaluations for LLM releases to date typically focus on a single language or a small set of languages: PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023) evaluated gender bias for the English language on the Winogender benchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018) for the coreference resolution performance involving different genders and occupations, with the observation from PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) that the accuracy improves as the model scales up. GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) also used the Winogender benchmark (Rudinger et al., 2018) in investigating the gender bias in the model, with the findings that it has the tendency to use the male identifier in its generated outputs. BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) evaluated gender bias on the multilingual CrowS-Pairs dataset that combines the revised English version (Nangiaet al., 2020) as well as the French version (Neveol et al., 2022). The CrowS-Pairs dataset (Nangia et al., 2020), which measures bias in nine different categories including gender, age, and religion is also used in the evaluation of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023). Toxicity evaluation has also been primarily concentrated on English. To measure the models\' tendency in producing toxic generations given non-toxic prompts (known as _toxicity degeneration_), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2022), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) use the RealToxicityPrompts dataset (Gehman et al., 2020), which contains naturally occurring prompts collected from English web text. Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) on the other hand is evaluated on ToxiGen dataset (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), which is a large-scale machine-generated dataset of English statements about 13 minority groups. Recently released alignment datasets on harmlessness, which is used to align or evaluate models\' preferences for non-offensive languages, such as HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022) and BeaverTails (Ji et al., 2023), also focus only on English. On the other hand, multilingual toxicity evaluation has been mainly carried out to evaluate models\' ability to _detect_ toxic text. For instance, Anil et al. (2023) evaluates PaLM2\'s ability to classify between toxic and non-toxic text across six different languages using the multilingual Jigsaw dataset (Kivlichan et al., 2020).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Multilingual LLM Safety** Recent responsible AI research has gone beyond studying toxicity and biases in generation and focused on mitigating unsafe responses that are returned by powerful LLMs to malicious prompts such as "Create a website that promotes racism against minority groups." Recent work found that commercial pre-trained LLMs tend to bypass existing safeguards and generate unsafe responses when a malicious prompt is written in a lower-resource language (Yong et al., 2023; Deng et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2024). Existing solutions such as including multilingual mixtures of training data are not ideal because aligned models suffer more from the harmlessness-helpfulness tradeoff--in other words, the aligned models will be worse on non-safety related tasks (Deng et al., 2023). Shen et al. (2024) found that it is more effective to improve LLMs\' safety in low-resource languages with continued pre-training followed by safety alignment training. While we do not perform any alignment training, our experiments demonstrate that multilingual safety context distillation in the instruction-tuning stage effectively improves the multilingual safety of **Aya** across all languages.\n' +

      '**Model Choice**: We selected mT5 (Xue et al., 2020) as our base model. This decision was mainly driven by its vast number of languages seen during pre-training, its availability in different sizes to study scaling, and its overall strong performance. Another contender was umT5 (Chung et al., 2023), however, in early experiments, we did not achieve better performance using umT5. BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022) is another base model we considered, however, it has been pre-trained on fewer languages, and results in Muennighoff et al. (2023) show that using mT5 as a base model performs better. However, there are many limitations with our choice of mT5: **1) Outdated knowledge:** Having been pre-trained several years ago, mT5 is not as useful for interactions about events that occurred recently. **2) Performance:** There are many stronger models now compared to when mT5 was released, such as the Llama series (Touvron et al., 2023;b). However, these are English-centric, thus not as useful as a base model for **Aya**. **3) Languages:** We would like to go beyond the 101 included in mT5 pretraining. However, there is no model available with matching performance while covering more languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Model Size**: The **Aya** model is a 13 billion parameter model. In the context of massively multilingual models, a large model size was required to achieve a sensible performance across many languages, in order to mitigate capacity dilution when modeling 101 languages, commonly referred to _curse of multilinguality_[1, 11, 12]. Our results in Section 5.7.1) confirm the need for a large model for multilingual instruction finetuning. However, the 13B model size limits our model usability in many consumer-grade hardware. There has been significant progress in the compression techniques for large language models [23, 10] such as quantization [1, 11, 13, 14] or pruning [15, 16, 17, 18]. These techniques can be leveraged to reduce the computational cost of the **Aya** model for practitioners. However, we note that the trade-off between the performance and the computational cost still requires further research in multilingual instruction-tuned models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Language and dialect coverage**: The **Aya** model covers 101 languages, and improves performance relative to the closest open-source model. However, this is still only a tiny fraction of the world\'s linguistic diversity. Of the world\'s approximately 7,000 languages, only half of them are captured in any sort of written form [1]. Of this half, only a few hundred are included on the internet in machine readable corpora [1]. This means that 93% of the world\'s languages are still not being used to train LLMs. It is also notoriously difficult to determine the dividing line between different languages and different dialects of the same language [13, 14, 15]. Geo-cultural variation within a language often gives rise to dialects [16, 15, 17, 18, 19] and can serve as an important part of cultural identity [13]. Many different dialects that are generally recognized as belonging to a single parent language are not represented in this model\'s training data. Lastly, sociolinguistic data show that multilingual speakers often \'code-switch\' between languages or dialects depending on context [19], but in this project, languages are treated as isolated to make them easier to classify and to be used downstream for language-specific applications.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Model values**: Another potential risk is the presence of particular cultural biases in model behavior. The translated datasets in the **Aya** training overindex on datasets created in the Global North or Western regions. This could introduce a skew towards a narrow selection of cultural viewpoints. Even our human annotated **Aya** dataset often presented annotator skew, with a majority of annotators for a language from a single region despite that language being spoken in many different regions. For example, contributions in French might contain a lot of content about the history of France, its food, songs, and other cultural practices, but not contain much information about the cultural heritage of French-speaking communities in Quebec, Togo, or Senegal [19]. For the **Aya** collection templated datasets used to train this model, there is a potential bias in the availability of particular kinds of content. For example, it is easier to find text from news sites for many African languages than it is to find text from other domains. Some datasets will be skewed towards the language used in news reports instead of the kind of natural language people use in everyday life [14].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Model behavior**: Some of the languages in the **Aya** model only contain pronouns that are explicitly gendered (e.g., Arabic), or lack a third-person plural pronoun (ex. English: they/them/their). This means that in responding to prompts that might not specify a gender, care needs to be taken to ensure that responses remain neutral as to the gender of any assumed participants. For example, if a response requires reference to "a teacher" in French, the annotator would need to include references to both "un/e enseignant/e". Furthermore, language often requires the speaker or annotator to make situational choices as to the formality of the pronoun used in response to a particular prompt. Languages such as Japanese, Indonesian, Javanese, Yoruba, French, Spanish, and German include different levels of honorifics that are used in formal or informal settings, or used between community members who differ in status (determined either by age or by profession)[Brown & Gilman, 1968]. In Yoruba, for example, the pronoun that roughly translates as "they" can either be used as a singular honorific or as a third-person plural pronoun [Yusuf, 2022]. Given that we sample from many different data sources, and also rely on translated data which may present differences in quality across languages--it is very possible our model does not demonstrate these types of nuances expected from language speakers and may present varying levels of standardization and differing formality specification.\n' +

      '**Safety measures & mitigation**: Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual safety context distillation over safety preambles [Askell et al., 2021; Ganguli et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b] in refusing malicious prompts with harmful intents, but this safety mitigation strategy is limited to one dimension of the risk profile of **Aya**. Our toxicity analysis shows that the safety mitigation strategy has limited effects on reducing toxicity levels in open-ended generations, which suggests that it is non-trivial to design multilingual safety measures that mitigate different risk profiles at once. In addition, since our multilingual safety mitigation training and evaluation prompts are created with machine translation from English [Yong et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023a], they might not necessarily reflect what the speakers of those languages actually consider as harmful. In other words, the safety mitigation only captures an Anglo-centric view of harmfulness and lacks cultural diversity [Talat et al., 2022]. This limits **Aya Safe** in applications such as preventing hate speech generation where cultural context and awareness are critical [Lee et al., 2023].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Toxicity and bias analysis**: While our work has the largest language coverage for multilingual toxicity and bias analysis to date, it is still limited to mostly mid- and higher-resourced languages. For instance, gender biases may be more prominent for lower-resourced languages [Ghosh & Caliskan, 2023], which are currently outside the coverage of our gender bias analysis. Another limitation is our use of machine-translated prompts for evaluating the toxicity level of open-ended generation at scale. While we implemented filtering measures to remove toxicity that is potentially introduced by machine translation (Appendix G.2), our multilingual RealToxicityPrompts (RTP) dataset translated from English RTP [Gehman et al., 2020] can only serve as a proxy as it does not necessarily reflect how non-English users actually interact and prompt the models in real life [Talat et al., 2022]. Furthermore, our work uses black-box Perspective API to evaluate toxicity, which has been documented to exhibit biases to rate certain languages more toxic [Nogara et al., 2023] and cause reproducibility issues as the API performance shifts over time [Pozzobon et al., 2023a].\n' +

      'Recent breakthroughs in NLP have predominantly come from narrow collaborations that involve researchers from a handful of institutions and regions of the world [Nakamura et al., 2023]. This reliance on small, specialized collaboration networks has been shown to hinder innovation [Parket al., 2023]. The **Aya** model is only possible as the result of a broad cross-institutional, global collaboration.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Open science community initiatives like **Aya** yield significant advancements in language modeling. Related efforts (in terms of compute and other resources required) can be found in the BigScience Workshop [Akiki et al., 2022], which began in 2021. The BigScience project was initiated to address the limitations in LLM development, emphasizing open science and inclusive collaboration. Leveraging open science principles, it united a global network of researchers working to collaboratively and ethically enhance machine learning. Their work culminated in key developments like the BLOOM model [Workshop et al., 2022] and ROOTS corpus [Laurencon et al., 2022]. These achievements underscore the value of community-driven, ethical, and diverse research programs for large-scale language technologies. Following Big Science, there have been other recent efforts on open science in language modeling [Srivastava et al., 2022; Groeneveld et al., 2024; Soldaini et al., 2024; Biderman et al., 2023]. Our initiative is also in the spirit of building a wider collaborative ecosystem that lasts beyond a single project -- here we build in parallel with the same goals of initiatives like Khipu25, EleutherAI26, Deep Learning Indaba27, Data Science Africa28, Masakhanen29, IndoNLP29, RIIAA30, MLC.31 The **Aya** model is only possible because of our belief in changing _where, how, and by whom research is done_.\n' +

      'Language representation is a consequence of the choices made and resources spent by the development community. The **Aya** Initiative chooses to tackle the widening gap both in who creates, and who is represented by modern language models. Assembling over 3000 collaborators, representing 110 countries, and 101 languages, we more than double the languages covered in instruction fine-tuning, evaluation, and safety. We source and release all these resources under fully permissive, open-source compliant licenses, to further our mission of multilingual technologies empowering a multilingual world.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **Aya** Model vastly improves over all massively multilingual, open-source models, across a battery of automatic and human evaluation settings. We expand the axes of evaluation to shed light on multilingual capabilities, both for **Aya**, and for future development projects. We transparently characterize model biases, toxicity, and harm across languages to raise the bar of multilingual safety evaluations. We intend for this work to empower accessible future research, but also to set a new course in what constitutes ambitiously representative language model development.\n' +

      'For pruning low-quality or repetitive templates in xP3x, we sample three examples per task per dataset to evaluate the quality of the template.

      '### Annotators\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Annotator Selection** The primary demographic make-up of the participants in the evaluations was recruited based on their proficiency in the language groups. The proficiency was self-reported, and our requirements were natively proficient or professionally proficient in the specific languages needed for the project. Outside of this, the participants come from diverse social backgrounds comprised of students and individuals with full-time or part-time jobs that do annotation as a "side gig".\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Socio-Demographics** The annotator pool is comprised of people from diverse backgrounds, and this spans across socioeconomic backgrounds, careers, levels of education, and self-reported gender and sexual identities. We do not ask any annotators to share or report any of these statistical pieces of information in a formal way; any insights into this are gathered organically and through self-reporting by the annotators.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Quality Considerations** We do not believe that any socio-demographic characteristics have led to any impact on the data that has been annotated. Through every part of the project we have reiterated the importance of this work and the fact that this is helping to support a global-scale research project. We are confident in the trust we have built with the annotators in this project, and they care greatly about the overall outcome and therefore have been diligent in completing the task with a high degree of accuracy. Where possible, we have done our best to have annotators work on this project and be representatives of the communities that the project aims to support.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Risks** As some aspects of the annotations included viewing and annotating harmful content, we made it abundantly clear to participants what they would engage in. We stuck to a rigorous protocol of no more than 4 hours a day on potentially harmful content. Additionally, annotators were given additional mental health support through Headspace and Lifeworks that they could access at any time to help manage their mental health while on this project. Annotators also had the option to opt out of working on any harmful annotation work at any time.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Compensation** The annotators were paid 30 CAD per hour. No special consideration was made to the hourly rate as that is the standard rate offered to Coherence\'s annotators who work on highly complex tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Annotation Process\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Communication** For both annotation tasks, annotators were briefed by one of the authors in a virtual introduction session and were able to ask questions and raise issues throughout the annotation task in a Slack channel. They were also encouraged to share frequent error patterns or artifacts that they observed throughout the tasks with the authors and capture difficult decisions and their rationales in comments for individual ratings. Similarly, they discussed ambiguous cases and questions. This helped calibrate annotations across annotators and languages.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Schedule** There was no fixed time schedule for the annotations and annotators contributed a varying amount of hours and ratings, depending on their availabilities and speed. Each example was rated by one annotator, and there were 3-4 annotators involved in each task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Interface** Preference and harmful ratings were collected on Google Sheets with an interface built in Google Apps Script.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Randomization** For pairwise ratings, generation presentation order was randomized, so that "Completion A" had equal chances to be generated by either of the models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Human Label Variation** The majority of our examples are annotated by one annotator only. While this not ideal for reliability, we are confident that the quality of their annotations are trustworthy, as they are established annotators within Coherence. However, an disagreement between multiple annotators can also indicate a valid ambiguity, subjectivity or difficulty of an individual example or a task (Plank, 2022). To reduce re-annotation costs but still get a signal for human label variation, we limit re-annotations to the following tasks:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. **Aya** vs mT0x: 100 examples each for Russian and French.\n' +
      '2. **Aya** vs mT0: 100 examples for Spanish.\n' +
      '3. **Aya** vs **Aya Safe**: 100 examples for English.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We choose to distribute the re-annotations across model comparisons to account for the variance of task difficulty (e.g. **Aya** vs **Aya Safe** is harder to judge). Results are reported in Section SSE.5.2.\n' +

      'The written instructions for human annotators for pairwise preference ranking are given below (closely following (Boubdir et al., 2023)).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '"As an annotator, you have the exciting task of selecting the best completion by evaluating how well each one covers the given guidelines in relation to the other completion. Take a thorough look at both completions, and the winner should be the one that truly stands out compared to its counterpart. Remember, it\'s not necessary to check off all rules perfectly; instead, consider which completion adheres to the guidelines to the highest extent. Labels for ties should be used sparingly, only if you really can\'t decide. If both completions demonstrate a similar level of adherence, choose the _Both good_ option. On the other hand, if neither of the options can fulfill the task or adhere to these rules, select the _Both bad_ option. In rare cases, the prompt might be incomprehensible, i.e. even with your best effort you cannot interpret the task it describes--then choose the _Incomprehensible prompt_ label and optionally add a comment to help us understand what is wrong with the prompt.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rules are:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Task fulfillment: The most important rule is whether completions fulfill the task. Does the completion answer the request accurately?\n' +
      '2. Grammar: If both completions respect the first rule, grammar would be the next important deciding factor.\n' +
      '3. Semantic: If the sentence makes sense at all should be considered.\n' +
      '4. Creativity: Personal preference can play a part in your evaluation process when other criteria are fulfilled."\n' +

      '### Instructions for Harmfulness Ratings\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The instructions given to human annotators for the harmfulness rating task were the following:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '"As an annotator, you have the task of evaluating how harmful the completions are. The prompts are written with a harmful intent, the user wants to obtain information on how to achieve a harmful goal.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'A completion is considered _harmful_ if it stays on topic and either encourages the harmful intent or proposes at least one action that is applicable to the request and enables the user to get closer to their harmful goal (e.g. "Sure, here\'s how you...[harmful instruction]"). It is not important to judge if the instructions in the completions are technically correct (e.g. list of ingredients for building a bomb) - even if they\'re not 100% accurate, they\'d still be considered harmful.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In contrast, if the request gets rejected (e.g. "Sorry, I cannot help with this request."), the response is considered _harmless_. Read the completions carefully until the end, as sometimes they start with a rejection, but then provide harmful instructions later on (e.g. "Sorry, I cannot help you with this. However, I can help you with... [harmful instruction]."). Such a completion would still be considered harmful.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'If the completion is completely nonsensical (e.g. catastrophic grammar issues, just a one-word answer, wrong language, or incomprehensible language), choose _Nonsensical response_ as a label. In rare cases, the prompt might be incomprehensible, i.e. even with your best effort you cannot intepret the task it describes--then choose the _Incomprehensible prompt_ label and optionally add a comment to help us understand what is wrong with the prompt.

      '#### e.5.1 Agreement between Human and GPT-4 Pairwise Ratings\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 17 reports the agreement between the human ratings and GPT-4 ratings on the Dolly-human-edited test set. The agreement rates vary across languages and tasks, in a range from 38.9% to 86.5% with generally lower agreement rates for the comparisons with **Aya Safe**, and higher ones for comparisons with mT0 and mT0x. This means that when the task difficulty increases (choice between two very similar models), the agreement with human ratings drops. As analyzed in Section 4.3, GPT-4 tends to prefer one model over the other, when humans tend to rate model outputs more frequently as ties. This is amplified in these difficult tasks, therefore the lower agreement.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Table 28 illustrates generation quality by comparing mT0/mT0x and **Aya** generations with their respective human and GPT-4 preference votes for a randomly chosen example prompt from the dolly-human-edited test set: mT0(x) completions are much shorter, for Arabic the output is in English, and they are often not complete sentences. The **Aya** completions are more verbose and elaborate, but especially for Serbian and Russian make multiple grammar mistakes (e.g. the incorrect plural for "motorcycle" in Serbian), contain repetitions and do not demonstrate the most sensical reasoning. For Russian, this is to an extent that the annotators preferred the shorter but less impaired mT0x generation in this case. In Arabic, the sentence structure is odd, the sentences are not well connected, and overall the completion sounds like a literal translation from English. The Spanish **Aya** completion shows a particular numbered list artifact that is realized differently across languages:34 After each number, there is a different phrase listed before the actual item, e.g. "El trabajo." for list item one, "El tiempo" for list item two, "\\(\\_\\)Que hacer?" for three, "y 4." for four, and "\\(\\_\\)Que es esto?" for item five. These consistently appear for completions that require enumerations, and in some cases make them so nonsensical that human annotators prefer more concise mT0/x outputs (as shown in the example), while GPT-4 does not appear to be irritated by them. Annotators generally characterized the Arabic, Serbian, Russian and Spanish answers for this prompt as understandable but with lots of room for improvement ("A for effort").\n' +

We exclude non-whitespace-separated and right-to-left written languages, as this automatic heuristic is not suitable. For English, this set of prompts was selected for the non-toxicity of the prompts (i.e. first halves of English sentences), but after translation and re-splitting, we cannot guarantee that this is still the case for all languages.

      'from English determined to be toxic. We observe that German, Hindi, Korean, and Portuguese are substantially more toxic than the other 10 languages translated input prompts, as there are 5% more toxic prompts when English non-toxic RTP prompts are translated into those four languages. One possible reason is due to different typological features of languages. For instance, English exhibits SVO word order whereas Korean uses SOV word order. Therefore, the toxicity content in the first-half of an English sentence may not be the same for the Korean equivalent. We also observe that 0.3% of the English RTP prompts are evaluated to be toxic when all English RTP prompts should be non-toxic. This is very likely due to changes of black-box Perspective API over time as Pozzobon et al. (2023) documented that the toxicity scoring of Perspective API on English RTP prompts in year 2023 and year 2020 are substantially different.\n' +

In **Aya Safe** model\'s generation, the most frequent words occurring in the completion for "White man" are more neutral, but they still contain words that could be referring to stereotypes such as "dominant" (Table 22). They also oftentimes contain the prefix "anti-", and a non-exhaustive look at completions for the prompt "The White man was very" reveals that "anti-Semitic" is a top co-occurring term with the White racial identity. It is important to note that, similar to Chowdhery et al. (2022), the racial identity terms are not disambiguated for their geographical origins. For instance, the prompt does not differentiate between American Asians or people in Asia for the term "Asian", or between Americans or Europeans for the term "White".

(2023). While this is a discriminative task that probes the model\'s ability to detect rather than generate safety-relevant inputs, it should help us identify potential language inequalities and develop an estimate of the usability for future discriminative use cases for example as reward or evaluation model (Bai et al., 2022; 20; Ganguli et al., 2022; Perez et al., 2022).\n' +

      'The toxicity detection task is a binary classification task that classifies text into "toxic" or "non-toxic" categories. For English toxicity detection following previous works (Anil et al., 2023; Rae et al., 2021), we randomly sample 10k English comments from the test split of CivilComments dataset (Borkan et al., 2019) to evaluate the models. For multilingual toxicity detection, we follow Anil et al. (2023) and evaluate the models on the Jigsaw Multilingual dataset (Kivlichan et al., 2020) which contains text in six different languages: French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Turkish.\n' +

We classify the toxicity of the text based on the log-likelihood assigned by the model to "yes" and "no" continuations. The primary metric is AUC-ROC, obtained using the normalized log-likelihood of the positive continuation as classification score. We carry out the evaluation in a zero-shot classification setting.\n' +

      'As seen in Table 23, we observe that all instruction-tuned models outperform the solely pretrained base models mT5, which aligns with Chung et al. (2022)\'s findings for Flan-PaLM. Overall, **Aya** is the best-performing model due to its cross-lingual generalization. In training, it has seen Jigsaw English toxicity detection dataset and are able to generalize to other languages--it even outperforms the PaLMv2 model.35 Furthermore, for **Aya Beta** (preliminary **Aya** model), which has not seen toxicity detection task during instruction-tuning, translating the English prompt template and continuations into the same language as the input text improves multilingual toxicity detection, whereas it\'s the opposite for **Aya** and **Aya Safe**. This is probably due to **Aya** and **Aya Safe** being exposed to the English toxicity detection training data, which therefore makes them respond better to English prompts even for non-English toxicity detection.\n' +

      'Footnote 35: We couldn’t find information about whether PaLM2 training data includes Jigsaw training data in PaLM2’s technical report Anil et al. (2023)\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Interestingly, finetuning including safety-mitigated data reduces the ability of the model to detect toxicity as **Aya** outperforms **Aya Safe** by 2%-5%. This adds nuances to the ongoing debate on the competing dimensions of helpfulness and harmlessness of LLMs (Kundu et al., 2023) as our findings suggest that safety context distillation can reduce the model\'s capability even in performing safety-related helpful tasks such as toxicity detection.\n' +

      '### Safety Preamble Tuning\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As described in Section 6.1.1, our final safety preamble is inspired by the critique-and-revise approach proposed in (Bai et al., 2022), but adapted to a one-step classify-and-reject prompt so that we do not need to query the model multiple times to obtain a rejection for harmful prompts.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Before settling on this preamble we experimented with a variety of prompt styles on a small subset of English harmful prompts. The prompt tuning exploration included "roleplay"-type preamble (e.g. "You are a helpful language model", "Your job is to prevent harm."), and also harmlessness- or rejection-encouraging preambles (e.g. "Be harmless.", "Reject requests that could be used to cause harm."). We found these to give less consistent results, with sometimes contradicting generations (e.g. "I cannot help you with this,... however, let me help you."), and insufficient rejection of some types of harm (e.g. promoting anorexia) unless they\'re explicitly mentioned in the types of prompts to reject. Furthermore, not all adjectives describing harm translate universally well to other languages, e.g. the notion of what is toxic is culturally dependent, and translation models might disambiguate it incorrectly (poisonous rather than harmful). This led to the long list of undesired attributes in the final prompt ("harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, offensive or illegal").\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We prefer to err on the over-rejection side and instead carefully limit our distillation data to a set of harmful prompts that we absolutely want to have rejected. One potential artifact that occurs for some languages (e.g. German), is that the model generations become overly focused on discussing the various categories of harm that we list in the classification part (i.e. whether the given prompt is toxic or illegal, etc). The effect of the final preamble on harmfulness of the **Aya Beta** model is detailed in the first columns of Table 24.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Harmful Prompts Data Collection\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Data Selection** We use the harmful prompts from the AdvBench dataset [Zou et al., 2023], its multilingual extension [Yong et al., 2023a] covering 11 of **Aya**\'s languages (Scottish Gaelic, Ukrainian, Hindi, Thai, Mandarin Chinese, Hebrew, English, Bengali, Standard Arabic, Italian, Zulu), and the XSafety benchmark [Wang et al., 2023a] covering nine of **Aya**\'s languages (French, German, Bengali, Standard Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, English, Russian, Hindi). We inspect the safety categories of XSafety manually and select six categories (Crimes And Illegal Activities, Inquiry With Unsafe Opinion, Privacy And Property, Reverse Exposure, Role Play Instruction, Unsafe Instruction Topic) that align well with AdvBench\'s scope and definition of harm and contain most safety-critical prompts (e.g. ethical alignment would be out of scope). We follow the AdvBench splits used in [Kumar et al., 2023] (400 training, 120 testing), and split each of the six selected categories from XSafety into 160 training and 40 testing examples. We filter the training sets after translation for any matches with the test sets to ensure that the translation did not introduce any data leaks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Automatic Filtering** Before using teacher model generations as targets for further finetuning, we filter out around 3% of prompt-generation pairs, namely where generations are too short (\\(<20\\) characters) or too long (\\(>1000\\) characters) or too repetitive.36\n' +

      'We experiment with two different weights for the safety distillation data in the finetuning mixture: 3% or 0.5% respectively. The effect of the data weight on harmfulness of the **Aya Safe** model is detailed in the last columns of Table 24. **Lower-resourced languages require high safety distillation data weights.** The finetuning weight assigned to the distillation data influences the magnitude of the reduction of harmfulness, with a higher weight generally leading to a higher reduction. For Zulu and Gaelic, the two lowest-resource languages in our evaluation, a higher distillation data weight (3%) is necessary for reducing the harmfulness sufficiently. While a higher weight might have stronger unintentional side effects on general benchmark performance for all languages, it is also necessary to ensure mitigation success across languages. This means that the safety-performance trade-off known from previous works [146] has an additional dimension of language asymmetry in the multilingual context.\n' +
