      '\n' +
      'Legged robots navigating cluttered environments must be jointly _agile_ for efficient task execution and _safe_ to avoid collisions with obstacles or humans. Existing studies either develop conservative controllers (\\(<1.0\\) m/s) to ensure safety, or focus on agility without considering potentially fatal collisions. This paper introduces Agile But Safe (ABS), a learning-based control framework that enables agile and collision-free locomotion for quadrupedal robots. ABS involves an agile policy to execute agile motor skills amidst obstacles and a recovery policy to prevent failures, collaboratively achieving high-speed and collision-free navigation. The policy switch in ABS is governed by a learned control-theoretic reach-avoid value network, which also guides the recovery policy as an objective function, thereby safeguarding the robot in a closed loop. The training process involves the learning of the agile policy, the reach-avoid value network, the recovery policy, and an extereception representation network, all in simulation. These trained modules can be directly deployed in the real world with onboard sensing and computation, leading to high-speed and collision-free navigation in confined indoor and outdoor spaces with both static and dynamic obstacles (Figure 1).\n' +

      '## I Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Agile locomotion of legged robots in cluttered environments presents a non-trivial challenge due to the inherent trade-off between agility and safety, and is crucial for real-world applications that require both robustness and efficiency. Existing works typically exhibit limited agility (velocity \\(<1\\) m/s) to ensure safety [35, 17, 7, 22, 27, 67, 12, 46, 41, 72], or focus solely on maximizing agility without considering safety in navigation scenarios [45, 53]. Our work distinguishes itself by achieving high-speed (max velocity \\(>3\\) m/s), collision-free quadrupedal locomotion in cluttered environments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The agility limitations in existing works in the navigation domain stem from varied factors. Regarding the formulation, some decouple locomotion and navigational planning into two subtasks and build hierarchical systems [35, 17, 7, 27, 46, 72]. Such decoupling not only constrains the controller from the optimal solution [55], but also results in conservative behaviors to ensure safety, thereby limiting the system from fully unleashing the locomotion agility. This work, instead, learns end-to-end controllers that directly output joint-level actions for collision-free locomotion to reach specified goal positions. Our approach is inspired by recent works [66, 50, 71, 28] where robots learn end-to-end controllers to overcome challenging terrains by integrating locomotion with navigation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Regarding the controller, some works employ model-based methods with simplified models, such as model predictive control (MPC) and barrier functions, for guaranteed safety [22, 12, 41]. The model mismatch and potential constraint violations such as slippage, together with the online computational burden, limit these controllers from agile motions and stable deployment in the wild [22, 32, 38]. On the other hand, recent progress of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) in legged locomotion has demonstrated remarkable agile motor skills that model-based controllers have not achieved [45, 53, 28, 38, 47, 34, 75, 43, 69, 11], although potentially unsafe in cluttered environments. We harness the flexibility and agility of model-free RL and further safeguard it using control-theoretic tools.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Named ABS, our framework goes beyond a single RL policy. First, we have a model-free perceptive agile policy that incorporates collision avoidance into locomotion, as presented in Section IV, enabling our Go1 robot to achieve peak speeds up to \\(3.1\\) m/s while being aware of collisions. However, the RL policy does not guarantee safety, so we safeguard the robot with another recovery policy (see Section VI) when the agile policy may fail. To decide which policy to take control, we use a policy-conditioned reach-avoid (RA) value network to quantify the risk level of the agile policy. This is inspired by [29] where model-free RA values can be efficiently learned based on the Hamilton-Jacobi reachability theory [3]. The RA value network is trained by a discounted RA Bellman equation, with data collected by the learned agile policy in simulation. Beyond being a threshold, the differentiable RA value network also provides gradient information to guide the recovery policy, thus closing the loop, which will be further presented in Section V.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To get collision avoidance behaviors that can generalize in different scenarios, we use a low-dimensional exteroceptive feature for policy and RA value training: the traveling distances of several rays cast from the robot to obstacles. In order to achieve this, we additionally train an exteroception representation (or ray-prediction) network with simulated data, which maps depth images to ray distances as detailed in Section VII. By doing so, we achieve robust collision avoidance in high-speed locomotion with onboard sensing and computation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Briefly, we identify our contributions as follows:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. A perceptive agile policy for obstacle avoidance in high-speed locomotion with novel training methods.\n' +
      '2. A novel control-theoretic data-driven method for RA value estimation conditioned on the learned agile policy.\n' +
      '3. A dual-policy setup where an agile policy and a recovery policy collaborates for high-speed collision-free locomotion, and the RA values govern the policy switch and guide the recovery policy.\n' +
      '4. An exteroception representation network that predicts low-dimensional obstacle information for generalizable collision avoidance capability.\n' +
      '5. Validation of ABS\'s superior safety measures and state-of-the-art agility amidst obstacles both indoors and outdoors (Figure 1).\n' +

      '### _Agile Legged Locomotion_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Model-based methods such as MPC use simplified models and handcrafted gaits to enable dynamic legged locomotion [5, 14, 15, 24, 33, 25]. Despite their impressive performance in simulation and under laboratory conditions, these methods struggle in the wild due to model mismatch and unexpected slippage [32, 38]. The online computational burden also limits perceptive model-based controllers from agile motions [12].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recently, RL-based controllers have shown promising results for robust locomotion [66, 38, 47, 23] and agile motor skills including high-speed running [31, 45, 53], challenging terrain traversal [71, 28, 34, 75, 11], jumping [39, 69], and fall recovery [66, 43, 62, 70]. However, existing works on agile locomotion mostly show to achieve fast speeds for racing or skillful motions to overcome challenging terrains. In cluttered environments, these methods necessitate a high-level navigation module for collision avoidance, which is typically conservative and greatly constrains the motion far below the motor limit [63, 72]. In contrast, this paper studies agile collision avoidance for versatile navigation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Legged Collision Avoidance_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Classical methods tackle collision avoidance in legged robots with collision-free motion planning [35, 17, 7] in the configuration space without considering the robot dynamics, leading to slow and statically stable gaits. MPC-based methods [22, 12, 57, 41] integrate planning and control by treating distances to obstacles as optimization constraints. However, they suffer from the aforementioned drawbacks of model-based controllers and slow movements (velocity \\(<0.5\\) m/s).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Learning-based methods are another choice. Hoeller et al. [27] and Zhang et al. [72] train RL-based policies that output twist commands to be tracked by the locomotion controller, while the velocity commands are bounded by \\(1\\) m/s to ensure safety. However, the decoupling of navigation planning and locomotion control makes high-speed locomotion risky, as the high-level planner is unaware of the low-level tracking error.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Yang et al. [67] instead provides an end-to-end RL-based solution that maps depth images and proprioceptive data directly to joint actions, but the robot can only walk forward and the velocity is limited to \\(\\sim 0.4\\) m/s. In contrast, our work deploys an end-to-end agile policy for omnidirectional rapid locomotion with collision avoidance, and safeguards the robot with RA values and a recovery policy. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to validate collision-free quadruped locomotion with maximum velocity up to \\(3.1\\) m/s. Even in tight space with dynamic adversarial obstacles, our system can still reach a peak velocity of \\(2.5\\) m/s and an average speed of \\(1.5\\) m/s (Figure 1 (f)).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Safe Reinforcement Learning_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There are two main categories of methods to perform safe RL [74]: 1) _end-to-end_ methods and 2) _hierarchical_ methods. Lagrangian-based methods [49, 4, 40, 58] are the most representative _end-to-end_ safe RL methods that solve a primal-dualoptimization problem to satisfy safety constraint where the Lagrange multipliers can be optimized along with the policy parameters. However, the constraint is often enforced before convergence, hindering exploration and lowering returns [49].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '_Hierarchical_ safe RL methods safeguard unsafe RL actions using structures of underlying dynamics [68, 65, 13] and control-theoretic safety certificates [48, 73, 10]. These methods typically build on the assumptions of available dynamics or safety certificate functions before learning, which heavily limits the scalability to high-dimensional complex systems. Some recent works learn safety prediction networks (or safety critics) and safety backup policies to safeguard RL when the safety critics indicate the nominal policy is unsafe [59, 30]. Nevertheless, these frameworks lack interplay between safety critics and backup policies, relying on the demanding assumption that the backup policy can restore safety without explicit optimization to satisfy the safety critics.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our approach aligns with the _hierarchical_ methods, yet it stands out with a distinctive strategy. We focus on estimating the reach-avoid values of the agile policy and feed the reach-avoid values\' gradient information back into the system to guide the recovery policy within a closed loop. This innovative approach enables a dynamic and adaptive recovery process. Notably, all our modules are trained in simulation using a model-free approach, enhancing the generalizability and scalability of our method.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Reach-Avoid Problems and Hamilton-Jacobi Analysis_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Reach-avoid (RA) problems involve navigating a system to reach a target while avoiding certain undesirable states. Hamilton-Jacobi (HI) reachability analysis [3] solves this problem by analyzing the associated Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation, which provides a set of states that the system must stay out of in order to remain safe.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'HJ reachability analysis faces computational challenges, which escalate exponentially with the system\'s dimensionality [9]. Recent learning-based methods [2] try to scale HJ reachability analysis to high-dimensional systems by learning value networks that satisfy the associated HJ partial differential equations and constraints. However, they still require explicit system Hamiltonian expression before learning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our method builds on another line of works [29, 20] that leverage contraction properties to derive a time-discounted reach-avoid Bellman equation. However, contrary to previous works that learn policy-agnostic RA values during RL training, we instead learn a policy-conditioned RA value network. This not only reduces the computational burden by avoiding the identifiability issue of the global RA set but also best suits our trained agile policy.\n' +

      'Fig. 2: Overview of ABS: (a) There are four trained modules within the ABS framework: 1) Agile Policy (introduced in Section IV) is trained to achieve the maximum agility amidst obstacles; 2) Reach-Avoid Value Network (introduced in Section V) is trained to predict the RA values conditioned on the agile policy as safety indicators; 3) Recovery Policy (introduced in Section VI) is trained to track desired twist commands (2D linear velocity \\(v_{x}^{\\pi},v_{y}^{\\pi}\\) and yaw angular velocity \\(v_{x}^{\\pi}\\)) that lower the RA values; 4) Ray-Prediction Network (introduced in Section VII) is trained to predict ray distances as the policies; asteroceptive inputs given depth images. (b) Illustration of the ABS deployment architecture. The dual policy setup switches between the _agile policy_ and the _recovery policy_ based on the estimated \\(\\hat{V}\\) from the _RA value network_: 1) if \\(\\hat{V}<V_{\\text{threshold}}\\), the _agile policy_ is activated to navigate amidst obstacles; 2) if \\(\\hat{V}>V_{\\text{threshold}}\\), the _recovery policy_ is activated to track twist commands that lower the _RA values_ via constrained optimization.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _System Structure_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 2, our proposed ABS framework involves a dual-policy setup where the agile policy \\(\\pi^{\\text{Agile}}\\) and the recovery policy \\(\\pi^{\\text{Recovery}}\\) work together to enable agile and safe locomotion skills. The agile policy performs agile motor skills (up to \\(3.1\\) m/s on Unitree Go1) to navigate the robot based on goal commands (target 2D positions and headings) with basic collision-avoidance ability (see also Section IV). The recovery policy is responsible for safeguarding the agile policy by rapidly tracking twist commands (2D linear velocity \\(v_{x}^{c},v_{y}^{c}\\) and yaw rate \\(\\omega_{z}^{c}\\)) that can avoid collisions (see also Section V-C and Section VI). Both policies output joint targets that are tracked by a PD controller.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'During deployment, the policy switch is governed by RA values conditioned on the agile policy, estimated using a neural network \\(\\hat{V}\\) (see also Section V). With a safety threshold \\(V_{\\text{threshold}}=-\\epsilon\\) where \\(\\epsilon\\) is a small positive number, we have:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* If \\(\\hat{V}\\geq V_{\\text{threshold}}\\), we search for a twist command that drives the robot closer to the goal while maintaining safety based on \\(\\hat{V}\\) (see also Equation (21)). The recovery policy takes control and tracks the searched twist command.\n' +
      '* If \\(\\hat{V}<V_{\\text{threshold}}\\), the agile policy takes control.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We expect the system to activate the agile policy in most time, and use the recovery policy as a safeguard in risky situations until it is safe again for the agile policy, _i.e._, \\(\\hat{V}<V_{\\text{threshold}}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For collision avoidance, both the agile policy and the RA value networks need exteroceptive inputs. Inspired by [28, 16, 1], we choose to use a low-dimensional exteroception representation: the distances that 11 rays travel from the robot to obstacles, similar to sparse LiDAR readings. We train a network that maps raw depth images to predicted ray distances (see also Section VII), and the ray distances serve as part of the observations for the agile policy and the RA value network.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To summarize, as shown in Figure 2 (a), ABS needs to train four modules all in simulation:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. The _agile policy_ (Section IV) is trained via RL to reach the goal without collisions. We design goal-reaching rewards to encourage the most agile motor skills.\n' +
      '2. The _RA value network_ (Section V) is trained to indicate the safety for the agile policy. We use a data-driven method to train it based on the RA bellman equation (Equation (5)), and collect data in simulation by rolling out the agile policy.\n' +
      '3. The _recovery policy_ (Section VI) is trained to track twist commands rapidly from high-speed movements.\n' +
      '4. The _ray-prediction network_ (Section VII) is trained to predict ray distance observations from depth images. We collect synthetic depth images and ray distances in simulation by rolling out the agile policy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'All of the four modules are directly deployed in the real world after training.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## IV Learning Agile Policy\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As mentioned in Section III-C, we train an agile policy to achieve high agility amidst obstacles. Previous works on learning agile locomotion typically employ the velocity-tracking formulation [45, 53], _i.e._, to track velocity commands on open, flat terrains. However, designing a navigation planner for these velocity-tracking policies in cluttered environments can be non-trivial. To ensure safety, the planner may have to be conservative and unable to fully unleash the locomotion policy\'s agility.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Instead, we use the goal-reaching formulation to maximize the agility, inspired by [50, 71]. Specifically, we train the robot to develop sensorimotor skills that enable it to reach specified goals within the episode time without collisions. The agility is also encouraged by a reward term pursuing high velocity in the base frame. By doing so, the robot naturally learns to achieve maximum agility while avoiding collisions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This section presents the details of our agile policy learning. A detailed comparison between goal-reaching and velocity-tracking formulations for agility will be presented in Section IX-A1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Observation Space and Action Space_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The observation space of the agile policy consists of the foot contacts \\(c_{f\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}}\\), the base angular velocities \\(\\omega\\), the projected gravity in the base frame \\(g\\), the goal commands \\(G^{c}\\) (i.e., the relative position and heading of the goal) in the base frame, the time left of the episode \\(T-t\\), the joint positions \\(q\\), the joint velocities \\(\\dot{q}\\), the actions \\(a\\) of the previous frame, and the exteroception (i.e., log values of the ray distances) \\(R\\). Here we omit the step-based timestamps (\\(t-1\\) for the actions and \\(t\\) otherwise) for brevity. We refer to the collection of all these variables as \\(o^{\\text{Agile}}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Among these observations, only \\(g\\) and \\(G^{c}\\) require the state estimators for respectively orientation and odometry. All other values are available from raw sensor data without cumulative drifts. The IMU-based orientation estimation for \\(g\\) (i.e., roll and pitch) is usually very accurate, and our policy can effectively handle the odometry drift (as we can even suddenly change the goals in the run, see Section IX-C). Therefore, our agile policy is robust to inaccurate state estimators which can be problematic for model-based controllers [6, 32, 18].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The action space of the agile policy consists of 12-d joint targets. A PD controller tracks these joint targets \\(a\\) by converting them to joint torques:\n' +

This involves first collecting policy trajectories and then training the policy-conditioned reach-avoid value. This two-stage process enhances stability compared to the online training method presented in [29].\n' +

      '\n' +
      'For RA dataset sampling, we make the obstacles distribute as in the highest difficulty level during the training of the agile policy. We roll out our trained agile policy for 200k episodes, and collect these trajectories for RA learning.\n' +

To better show the agility-safety boundary, we introduce 3 variants for each setting: an aggressive one ("-a") doubling the agile reward term \\(r_{\\text{agile}}\\), a nominal one ("-n"), and a conservative one ("-c") halving the \\(r_{\\text{agile}}\\). Regarding the obstacles, we distribute eight obstacles within a 5.5 m\\(\\times\\) 4 m rectangle (during training it was 11 m\\(\\times\\) 5 m), so the test cases are in distribution but much harder than most cases during training.\n' +

      'We present an example case of ABS and other baselines in simulation, where the robot starting from \\((0,0)\\) needs to run through \\(8\\) obstacles to reach the goal \\((7,0)\\), as shown in Figure 8. The robot needs to first go through an open space, followed by two tight spaces, and then another open space. In this case, the \\(\\pi^{\\text{Agile}}\\) baseline runs fast but dies near the second tight space. The LAG baseline runs much slower than ABS. In contrast, our proposed ABS runs fast in the open spaces, and slows down in the tight spaces for safety thanks to the shielding of RA values and the recovery policy. Figure 8 (c) demonstrates the RA value landscape with respect to twist commands when the recovery policy is activated, where the searched twist consistently satisfies the safety constraint (i.e., \\(\\tilde{V}<V_{\\text{threshold}}\\)).\n' +

      '\n' +
      '#### IX-A1 Goal-Reaching v.s. Velocity-Tracking\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Velocity-tracking is the most commonly used formulation of locomotion controllers [51, 45, 47, 38], and is also adopted for our recovery policy. However, for the agile policy, we claim that goal-reaching is a better choice because it does not decouple locomotion and navigation for collision avoidance and can fully unleash the agility that is learned. Moreover, we empirically find that the goal-reaching formulation benefits sim-to-real transfer as it finds a better gait pattern for high-speed running.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'With the SOTA agile velocity-tracking policy in [45] as a baseline (referred to as "rapid"), we make detailed comparisons in Table IV. For fair comparison, we train "rapid" with the combination of our regularization rewards and the task rewards in [45], use the same action space for two policies, and remove the temporal information and system identification in [45].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '#### IX-A2 Effects of illusion and ERFI-50 randomization\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Two key components we add in domain randomization to help sim-to-real transfer is the illusion and the ERFI-50. As shown in Figure 11, without the illusion, the robot will sometimes tremble near a wall which it has never seen in simulation. Without ERFI-50, the robot will hit the ground with its head during running due to the sim-to-real gap in motor dynamics.\n' +

ABS achieves the best safety across three testbeds, with faster speeds compared to the LAG baseline.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Regarding the network size, larger networks improve the prediction accuracy at the cost of inference time. Note that the reported inference time in Table V was measured on Jetson Orin NX exclusively for perception inference. In practical deployment where computational resources are shared among various tasks, the actual update frequency can be considerably lower. For real-time high-speed locomotion, we opt for ResNet-18, balancing accuracy and responsiveness in dynamic environments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Instant Steering via Commands_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As mentioned in Section IV, we can change our goal commands even in the run time. Thanks to our single-frame observations and randomization settings, we can easily overwrite goal commands to achieve instant agile steering, as presented in Table VI. This enables direct human involvement similar to the velocity-tracking formulation, and Figure 12 showcases such operations in the real world.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### _Failure Cases and Limitations_\n' +
      '\n' +
      'First, when the obstacles are too dense and form a local minimum, our policy can easily fail, which is also reflected by the high timeout rates in the results. This is common in local navigation planners [72, 46] though, and a potential solution can be to add memory [64] or introduce a global hint [61].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Second, our generalization to dynamic environments are due to the shielding of RA values and the recovery policy. The RA values are learned with static obstacles, and can only generalize to quasi-static environments. If a dynamic object moves faster than the velocity limit of the recovery policy, the collision may happen. A potential solution is to predict the motions of the obstacles in the future [37, 54].\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Third, we limit the robot behaviors to only 2D locomotion and constrain the motions to have no flying phase. For 3D terrains such as stairs and gaps, the problem can be far more challenging because the locomotion skills and the collision avoidance are coupled.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fourth, implicit system identification techniques [38, 47, 45, 36] can leverage temporal information to represent real-world dynamics and facilitate sim-to-real transfer, but it is non-trivial to incorporate them into our system. This requires a latent embedding of the temporal information, which is hard to deal with for the RA module. The policy switch can also make the embedding out of distribution for the policies.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fifth, the vision system needs further improvement. In the Indoor (a) testbed, the only collision of ABS is due to the "undetected" objects by the ray-prediction network as the corridor is quite dim. Beside the network, the system can also be completed by adding more cameras around the body. In this way, the robot may also dodge the obstacles come from behind or the side. Event cameras may also help in highly dynamic scenarios, e.g., when dodging a high-speed ball [19]\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## X Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we achieve safe high-speed quadrupedal locomotion in cluttered environments. Our framework ABS employs a dual-policy setup where the agile policy enables the robot to run fast, and the recovery policy safeguards the robot. The learned reach-avoid values govern the policy switch and guide the recovery policy. A ray-prediction network provides exteroception representation for the agile policy and the RA value network. Some key takeaways are:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. For agility in collision avoidance, the best practice is to integrate locomotion and navigation rather than decoupling them as separate subtasks.\n' +
      '2. A low-dimensional exteroception representation can facilitate policy learning and generalization.\n' +
      '3. With the same reward terms and training settings, adjusting reward weights or choosing between RL and Lagrangian-based RL trades off agility and safety, while external shielding modules can help break the trade-off boundary.\n' +
