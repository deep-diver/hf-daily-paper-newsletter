      'To expand a scene during generation, one needs only to append empty blocks to overlap with the current scene and extrapolate existing latent tri-planes to populate new blocks. The extrapolation is done by conditioning the generation process with the feature samples from the overlapping tri-planes during the denoising iterations. Latent tri-plane extrapolation produces semantically and geometrically meaningful transitions that harmoniously blend with the existing scene.

      '## 1. Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Generating large amount of high-quality 3D contents is key for many practical applications, including video-games, film-making, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). The increasing demand for high-quality digital contents has made 3D generation a significant topic of research. Recently, in the 2D domain, denoise diffusion models [14], have demonstrated remarkable results in image synthesis and beyond, leading to the development of production-ready 2D generation tools, such as Stable Diffusion [15], Midjourney, and Dall-E [11]. The success in 2D domain has significantly sparked interest in the development of 3D generation tools. A multitude of researches on 3D generation have been published recently, most notable works include DreamFusion [13], Rodin [12], Get3D [14], Zero123 [15], SynC Dreamer [16], and LRM ([12]), etc.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'However, existing methods mainly focus on the generation of 3D content with fixed spatial extent (such as a small object of finite size). In this paper, we investigate a relatively new yet increasingly important task: _generating expandable (hence infinite) 3D scenes_. This task is particularly valuable for video gaming industry, as it delivers an immersive gaming experience by allowing users to interact freely with the world without being restricted by a predetermined world boundary, as seen in open-world games. Nonetheless, creating an unbounded and freely explorable scene is a non-trivial task. Current practices typically rely on artists\' manual labor, a time-consuming and costly process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Generating expandable 3D scenes using diffusion models poses two major challenges: First, 1) the generation of high-fidelity 3D shapes at the scene level is a difficult problem. The variance in 3D scenes is orders of magnitude greater than in single objects. A scene comprises basic objects, and the possibilities for arranging these objects are limitless. This high level of diversity makes it difficult to approximate its distribution using diffusion probabilistic models. Besides, 2) the expansion from an existing scene to a larger one is non-trival. The transition area between the old and new scenes needs to be both semantically and geometrically harmonious, adding another layer of complexity to the task.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Text2Room [10] is the most closely related work to our task. It employs a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to generate 2D images and lifts them to a 3D scene via the camera viewpoint and the estimated depth images. A scene is expanded by merging generated images from incrementally added camera viewpoints. Therefore, it is able to generate expandable 3D scenes with impressive texture results, though only at the room scale. However, since it critically relies on a monocular depth prediction, a poor depth prediction will lead to distorted geometry with missing details. In addition, the way it expands a scene (i.e., by leveraging a moving perspective camera) makes it difficult to be extended beyond the room scale. This is because a perspective camera is prone to occlusion. For instance, when the camera passes through a wall, the continuity of the image can be disrupted by occlusion, which could also lead to discontinuities in the generated 3D shapes.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Instead of generating 3D through 2D image lifting, another research direction involves directly learning to produce 3D data, using supervision from either 3D shape ground truths or posed multi-view images. Notable methods include EG3D [23], Rodin [12], and Get3D [14], etc. These approaches represent 3D data with a continuous hybrid neural field architecture, typically consisting of a tri-plane and an MLP decoder. The tri-plane is a tensor used to factorize the dense 3D volume grid. It is built on three axis-aligned 2D planes: the XY, YZ, and XZ planes. The MLP decoder converts the tri-plane feature into a continuous value representing the scene, which could be occupancy, signed distance field (SDF), radiance field [13], etc. Tri-plane is significantly more compact and computationally efficient than a full 3D tensor and conducive to generative architectures developed for 2D image synthesis. This has been a key factor in making high-quality direct 3D data generation possible.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we develop a tri-plane diffusion based approach to generate expandable 3D scenes. Our method is called BlockFusion. It generates 3D scenes in the form of cubic blocks and extends the scene in a straightforward sliding-block way. To generate high-quality 3D shapes, we directly train BlockDiffusion on 3D scene datasets. For network training, we randomly crop complete 3D scenes into incomplete 3D blocks with fixed sizes. We run per-block fitting to convert all training blocks into tri-planes, which we call the raw tri-planes. We found that directly training diffusion on raw tri-planes results in undesirable collapsed shapes. This issue is possibly caused by the high redundancy in the raw tri-planes and the substantial shape variance in the data. Inspired by stable diffusion [13], we apply an auto-encoder to compress the raw tri-planes into a latent tri-plane space to run diffusion. The latent tri-plane space is significantly more compact and computationally efficient than the raw tri-plane while maintaining similar representation power. In contrast to previous work, tri-plane diffusion on such a latent representation allows for the first time to reach high-quality and diverse 3D shape generation at scene level.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To expand a scene, we add empty blocks to overlap with the current scene and extrapolate existing tri-planes to populate the new blocks. Specifically, the extrapolation is done by conditioning the generation process with the feature samples from the overlapping tri-planes during the reverse diffusion iterations. The extrapolation is also carried out in the latent tri-plane space. This process produces semantically and geometrically meaningful transitions that seamlessly blend with the existing scene, ensuring a coherent and visually pleasing scene expansion.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To provide users with more control over the generation process, we introduce a 2D layout conditioning mechanism, which allows users to precisely determine the placement and arrangement of elements by manipulating 2D object bounding boxes. We also demonstrate that the color and texture of the scenes can be created using an off-the-shelf texture generation tool, thereby increasing the visual allure of the scene.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To summarize, BlockFusion presents 1) a generalizable, high-quality 3D generation model based on latent tri-plane diffusion, 2) a latent tri-plane extrapolation mechanism that allows harmonious scene expansion, and 3) a 2D layout condition mechanism for precise control over scene generation. Experimental results indicate that BlockFusion is capable of generating diverse, geometrically consistent and unbounded large 3D scenes with unprecedented high-quality shapes in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.\n' +

      'Starting from Gaussian noise samples, Diffusion probabilistic models (Ho et al., 2020; Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015) generate clear images by learning to progressively remove noise from the original noise sample. Recent advances in diffusion models (Dhariwal and Nichol, 2021; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in synthesizing high-quality and diverse images. Nonetheless, training diffusion models directly in high-resolution pixel space can be computationally prohibitive. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) (Rombach et al., 2022) address this issue with a two-stage approach: they first compress the image through an auto-encoder and then apply diffusion models on smaller spatial representations in the latent space. Diffusion models can be trained with guiding information (e.g., text prompt, semantic layout, category label) to facilitate personalization, customization, or task-specific image generation. There are basically two ways of manipulating generated content. The first is realized through training a new model from scratch or finetuning a pretrained diffusion model, adding various conditioning controls, e.g., sketch, depth, segmentation, (Avrahami et al., 2023; Bashkirova et al., 2023; Brooks et al., 2023; Gal et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Mou et al., 2023; Nichol et al., 2021; Ramesh et al., 2022; Rombach et al., 2022, 2022; Ruiz et al., 2023; Voynov et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). This approach requires extensive dataset building and extra computational consumption. The other line of methods adapts pretrained model and add some controlled generation capability during inference. With only slight modification to the generative process, (Avrahami et al., 2022; Bar-Tal et al., 2023; Hertz et al., 2022; Tumanyan et al., 2023) examine a wide variety of controlling diffusion models in a training/finetuning-free way.\n' +

      'The success of 2D generation tools based on diffusion models, notably Stable Diffusion(Rombach et al., 2022), Midjourney, and Dall-E, has significantly sparked interest in the development of 3D generation tools. There are two main streams for this task: the methods that lift 2D (generated) images into 3D models, and the methods that directly run diffusion on 3D data.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**2D-lifting methods.** DreamFusion (Poole et al., 2022) optimizes a Neural Radiance Field (Mildenhall et al., 2021) using the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, which distills prior knowledge from 2D image diffusion models into the volume rendering output of the NeRF. Magic3D (Lin et al., 2023) adopts an SDS loss-based second stage to further refine the mesh extracted from DreamFusion. SDS-based approaches demonstrate impressive results. However, they typically require hours of optimization and struggle with maintaining shape consistency, leading to a phenomenon called the Janus-face problem (Poole et al., 2022). Several methods have been developed that focus on the direct generation of consistency-enhanced multi-view 2D images, and these techniques reconstruct 3D shapes from the generated multi-view images. Zero123 (Liu et al., 2023) fine-tunes Stable Diffusion model (Rombach et al., 2022) to generate novel views by conditioning on the input image and camera transformation. One2345 (Liu et al., 2023) converts the multi-view image from Zero123 to 3D using an SDF-based neural surface reconstruction method. One2345++ (Liu et al., 2023) fine-tunes a 2D diffusion model for consistent multi-view image generation, and then elevating these images to 3D with the aid of multi-view conditioned 3D diffusion models. Syncedreamer (Liu et al., 2023) and Consistent (Yang et al., 2023) synchronize multi-view image generation process by explicitly correlating features in 3D space. Wonder3d (Long et al., 2023) improves the generation fidelity by introducing a cross-domain diffusion model that generates multi-view normal maps in addition to the color images. LRM (Hong et al., 2023) treats the single-image-to-3D problem as a reconstruction problem and solves it using Transformer in a deterministic way. However, LRM can lead to blurry and washed-out textures for unseen parts of objects due to mode averaging. To address this issue, Instant3D (Li et al., 2023) inputs multi-view consistent images into LRM to infer geometry and textures for unseen parts. DMV3D (Xu et al., 2023) employs LRM as a multi-view denoiser, which iteratively produces a cleaner tri-plane NeRF from noisy sparsely posed multi-view images.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**3D diffusion models.** Another line of research involves directly training diffusion models to generate 3D shapes. As the supervision comes directly from 3D shape ground truth or posed multi-view images, the generated results typically exhibit superior geometric quality compared to those from 2D diffusion-based methods. These methods can be categorized based on the type of 3D representations they employ, including: polygon meshes (Gao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023), point clouds (Nichol et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2022), explicit 3D grids holding occupancy or SDF values (Liu et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023), or neural fields (Chen et al., 2023; Chou et al., 2023; Erkoc et al., 2023; Jun and Nichol, 2023; Muller et al., 2023; Shue et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). The hybrid neural field, which incorporates a tri-plane followed by a neural decoder, has been widely adopted in 3D diffusion models due to its computational efficiency. Rodin (Wang et al., 2023) first fits tri-plane NeRFs for a human upper body dataset, and then uses a two-stage coarse-to-fine diffusion model to generate the corresponding tri-planes. Similarly, NFD (Shue et al., 2023) trains a tri-plane diffusion model for 3D data parametrized via occupancy values. SSDNerf [31] merge tri-plane fitting and generation into a single-stage pipeline. However, in practice, tri-plane diffusion is still challenging to train due to its high dimensionality and irregularity. Existing methods only demonstrated simple cases with small data varieties, i.e., Rodin for canonicalized human upper-body dataset [24], and NFD and SSDNeRF for single-category objects in ShapeNet [3]. This paper follows this line of research but introduces a major change: we use an auto-encoder to compress the tri-plane into a highly compact latent tri-plane space for diffusion. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the stability, generalizability, and output quality of tri-plane diffusion.\n' +

      'Generating 3D scenes presents a more substantial challenge than generating single objects. This is because scenes are geometrically more complex than individual objects, and they cannot be contained in a fixed spatial size. Object retrieval-based approaches assume there is a database of objects, and they arrange the retrieved objects to fill an empty scene, as seen in Diffuscene [19] and Sceneformer [23], consequently, the synthesized scene can not contain novel elements that do not exist in the database. Text2Room [12] is the first method that uses 2D diffusion model to build a 3D generation tool. It first generates color and depth frames using 2D diffusion models, and then shift camera positions to generate new frames, which are integrated into a global map. A similar approach for broader outdoor scenarios can be found in SceneScape [14]. To allow precise control over the contents generated in a scene, ControlRoom3D[15] and CTRL-ROOM[22] develop panorama-based room generation models that take 3D room layouts as input conditions. Citygen [3] represents city scenes using the height map proxy, leading to a 2.5D scene generation. Other approaches focus on generating scenes with high-quality visual appearances. Given a room scene mesh, MVDiffusion [19] generates coherent multiview perspective images, which can be lifted to the 3D as the UV texture of the mesh. SceneDreamer [3] leverages in-the-wild 2D images to construct large scenes with photo-realistic volume rendering effects. However, it still relies on high-quality 3D scene meshes as input, consequently, the dimensions of the generated scenes are bounded by the dimensions of the input meshes.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'We use scene meshes for network training. We convert scene meshes to water-tight meshes and then randomly crop the meshes into cubic blocks. The size of the block is adjusted such that it is large enough to enclose major objects in the scene, e.g. beds in room scenes, or houses in outdoor scenes. Given that the blocks are randomly positioned within the scene, objects may be split by these blocks. In addition, the possible arrangements of objects within a block are limitless. Considerably, the variance in such a randomly cropped shape dataset is much larger than that of a single object-centered dataset. As a result, training diffusion on this type of data presents a greater challenge. We test on three different types of scenes including room, city, and village. Examples of training blocks can be found in Fig. 3. In addition to the shapes, we also create a 2D layout map for each scene. The layout map is the ground plane projection of the objects, grouped by their categories. These layout maps can be used\n' +

      '**Hybrid Neural SDF.** We use the signed distance field (SDF) to represent the shape. An SDF is a continuous distance function with values indicating the distance to the surface and signs indicating whether a point is inside or outside the object. The final surface can be extracted via marching cubes. The shape is reconstructed using the hybrid neural field structure, which consists of a tri-plane to hold the geometry feature and a multiple layer perceptron (MLP) with parameter \\(\\theta\\) to decode the signed distance value. The tri-plane is a tensor used to factorize the dense 3D volume grid. It is built on three axis-aligned 2D planes: the XY, YZ, and XZ planes. Formally, it reads \\(x=\\{x(i)\\}\\)\\(\\mathbf{x}(i)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}\\times C}\\), \\(i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\big{\\}}\\), where \\(N^{2}\\) is the plane resolution and \\(C\\) is the dimension of the feature. Given a query point \\(p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\), the function \\(\\Phi:\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\mapsto\\mathbb{R}\\) outputs the signed distance value:\n' +

The addition operation is performed along the feature dimension, reducing the three feature vectors into a single final feature.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Training points sampling.** Given the mesh of a training block, we sample on-surface points and off-surface points, and then compute the ground truth SDF values. On-surface point set, denoted as \\(\\Omega_{0}\\), is randomly sampled on the surface. Their SDF values are equal to zero and we also compute the surface normal GT for each of these points. Off-surface point set denoted as \\(\\Omega\\) is sampled uniformly at random inside the block. To avoid incorrect distance values resulting from mesh cropping, the ground truth SDF values of the off-surface points are computed with respect to the original water-tight mesh. We empirically found that the point set sizes \\(|\\Omega|=100000\\) and \\(|\\Omega_{0}|=500000\\) achieve solid shape-fitting results while maintaining optimization costs at a manageable level. The XYZ coordinates of all sampled points are normalized to the range [-1, 1].\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Triplane Fitting.** Our goal is to transform all training blocks into tri-planes, which will then be used for training our generative model. Inspired by pioneering works on shape representation with neural field-based SDFs (Atzmon and Lipman, 2020; Gropp et al., 2020; Park et al., 2019), we jointly optimize tri-plane \\(x\\) and MLP weights \\(\\theta\\) with the following geometry loss:\n' +

      'where \\(\\delta\\) is the step size. The Eikonal loss constrains \\(|\\nabla_{p}\\Phi(p)|\\) to be \\(1\\) almost everywhere, thus maintaining the intrinsic physical property of the signed distance function. We adopt the MLP initialization trick as introduced in SAL (Atzmon and Lipman, 2020), which constrains the initial SDF output to roughly approximate a sphere. This spherical geometry initialization technique significantly facilitates global convergence. Empirically, the loss weights are set to \\(\\lambda_{1}=100.0\\), \\(\\lambda_{2}=3.0\\), \\(\\lambda_{3}=1.0\\), and \\(\\lambda_{4}=0.5\\) across all datasets. The MLP is jointly trained with the tri-planes using a training subset consisting of 500 blocks. Upon convergence, the MLP is regarded as a generalizable SDF decoder. Then we freeze MLP and optimize the tri-planes for all blocks in the training data. In this work, the output tri-plane size is set to \\(N^{2}=128^{2},C=32\\). Following (Yan et al., 2024), a tri-plane is optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner, i.e., the resolution is initialized with \\(8^{2}\\) and gradually up-scaled to \\(128^{2}\\). Compared to directly optimizing at the final resolution, this trick significantly improves fitting robustness and reduces running time.\n' +

      'Now, we can convert a dataset of 3D blocks into a dataset of tri-planes with size \\(3\\times 128^{2}\\times 32\\). These tri-planes can faithfully reconstruct the 3D blocks, c.f. Fig. 10. We call them as the _raw tri-planes_.\n' +

      'Although our raw tri-planes can reconstruct high-quality shapes, we found that generating such tri-planes is significantly difficult. Directly training diffusion models on such tri-planes leads to collapsed results, as shown in Fig. 4. We argue that there are mainly two reasons for this: 1) the raw tri-plane is highly redundant, and 2) the shape diversity in our scene block dataset is too large. Although previous works like Rodin (Wang et al., 2023) and NFD (Shue et al., 2023) have proven the feasibility of diffusion on raw tri-planes, they only work on datasets with much smaller varieties, i.e., Rodin for canonicalized human upper bodies, and NFD for single-category\n' +

This approach results in a more robust model that generates higher-quality images. Inspired by Stable Diffusion, we train an auto-encoder to compress raw tri-planes into a latent tri-plane space with reduced resolution and feature channels. Precisely, given an raw tri-plane \\(x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times N^{2}\\times C}\\), the encoder \\(\\mathcal{E}\\) encodes \\(x\\) into a latent representation \\(z=\\mathcal{E}(x)\\), and the decoder \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) reconstructs the raw tri-plane from the latent, giving \\(\\dot{x}=\\mathcal{D}(z)=\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{E}(x))\\).\n' +

      '**Background on Diffusion Probabilistic Models.** Diffusion Models are probabilistic models designed to learn a data distribution \\(z_{0}\\sim q(z_{0})\\) by gradually denoising a normally distributed variable. This process corresponds to learning the reverse operation of a fixed Markov Chain with a length of \\(T\\). The inference process works by sampling a random noise \\(z_{T}\\) and gradually denoising it until it reaches a meaningful latent \\(z_{0}\\). DDPM (Ho et al., 2020) defines a diffusion process that transform latent \\(z_{0}\\) to white Gaussian noise \\(z_{T}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0},\\mathbf{I})\\) in \\(T\\) time steps.

However, naively running convolution on tri-planes does not produce satisfactory results, as the 3D relationships among the plane features are ignored. \\(\\Psi(\\cdot)\\) needs to incorporate operations that can account for the cross-plane feature relationships. To address this, Rodin (Wang et al., 2023) introduces a 3D-aware convolution, which employs max-pooling and concatenation to associate features between planes based on their 3D correlations. However, the simple max-pooling may lose valuable information. In this work, we build \\(\\Psi(\\cdot)\\) by leveraging the more powerful transformer to achieve cross-plane communication. The overall architecture of \\(\\Psi(\\cdot)\\) is shown in Fig. 5. This architecture enables effective 3D-aware feature learning.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Repaint (Lugmayr et al., 2022) demonstrate impressive image inpainting and extrapolation results using a pre-trained diffusion model. Their key idea is to synchronize the denoising process of the unknown pixels using the noised version of the known pixels. Inspired by Repaint, we leverage our pre-trained denoising backbone \\(\\Psi(\\cdot)\\) to extrapolate tri-planes. The extrapolation is carried out in the latent tri-plane space. Formally, given a known block \\(P\\) with latent code \\(z^{P}=\\left\\{z^{P}(i)|i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\right\\}\\) as a condition, and an empty block \\(Q\\) that partially overlaps with \\(P\\), the goal is to generate the latent tri-plane \\(z^{Q}=\\left\\{z^{Q}(i)|i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\right\\}\\) that can represent the new block. For simplicity, this paper only considers the case where \\(Q\\) is positioned by sliding along only one of the XYZ axes, which is sufficient for scene expansion.\n' +

      '**Plane-wise extrapolation.** The tri-plane is a factored representation of a dense 3D volume. The three planes are compressed but highly correlated, which makes extrapolation on tri-planes a non-intuitive task. To address this, as shown in Fig. 6, we factor tri-plane extrapolation into the extrapolation of three 2D planes separately, and then utilize our 3D-aware denoising backbone, \\(\\Psi\\), to blend information from the three planes. Specifically, given the \\(i\\)-th axis-align plane with \\(i\\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\), the overlap mask between plane \\(z^{P}(i)\\) and plane \\(z^{Q}(i)\\) is denoted as \\(O_{i}\\). Following Repaint (Lugmayr et al., 2022), extrapolating \\(z^{P}(i)\\) to obtain \\(z^{Q}(i)\\) is realized by synchronizing the denoising process of \\(z^{Q}(i)\\) using the noised version \\(z^{P}(i)\\) inside the overlap mask \\(O_{i}\\). Specifically, at step \\(t-1\\), we obtain the noised \\(z^{P}_{t-1}(i)\\) via\n' +

Finally, the 1D array is reshaped into planes for up-sampling convolution and re-assembled into the tri-plane structure.\n' +

      '**Resampling.** We found that simply applying synchronization does not always yield semantically and geometrically consistent results. This is because the noise-adding process in overlapping regions does not take into account the newly generated parts of the tri-plane in the non-overlapping region, thereby introducing disharmony. To address this issue, we leverage the resampling strategy as introduced in Repaint (Lugmayr et al., 2022). Specifically, at certain steps of the denoising process, noise is added again to the output using the forward diffusion equation in 9, meaning the inference process is rolled back. There are two hyper-parameters for resampling: 1) the roll-back step \\(J\\), and 2) the number of resampling times \\(R\\). In this paper, we set \\(J=100\\) and conduct an ablation study on \\(R=\\{0,1,2,3,7\\}\\).

In the Textured Mode, participants viewed a textured mesh, while in the Geometry-Only Mode, the texture was replaced with a monochrome material to emphasize the geometry.

This suggests that augmenting the number of resampling times can improve the quality of synchronization results. For clarity, \\(R=0\\) means that we do not perform synchronizations, i.e. the two blocks are generated independently while adhering to the shared layout conditions.

      'Fig. 11. **Qualitative results of tri-plane extrapolation.** The 3D box shows the block to extrapolate. The overlap ratios are 25% for top three rows and 50% for bottom three rows.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Fig. 12. **Layout-conditioned tri-plane extrapolation with different resampling times (\\(R\\)).** The Chamfer Distance is calculated based on point sets sampled from the two block meshes within their overlapping region. The shape consistency significantly improves after 1-time synchronization, and employing additional synchronization steps (i.e. resampling) further enhances shape consistency. \\(R=0\\) means no synchronizations.\n' +

      'a new table shaped like the number "24" and a novel room shaped like a heart. This is made possible by its ability to re-combine basic shapes, such as fractions of tables and walls, under layout guidance. This demonstrates the potential of BlockFusion as a powerful tool for generating diverse and visually appealing scenes.\n' +

      '### Large Scene Generation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We showcase the capability of BlockFusion for large scene generation. The results are displayed in Fig. 1, 7, and 8, for village, city, and room scenes, respectively. The generation process is conditioned on layout maps that are created using an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). It is important to emphasize that the scope of the scenes can be expanded infinitely. We believe that BlockFusion is the first method capable of generating 3D scenes at such a large scale while maintaining a high level of shape quality.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 5. Conclusion and Discussion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Experiments show the proposed BlockFusion is capable of generating diverse, geometrically consistent, and unbounded large 3D scenes with high-quality geometry in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The generated mesh can be seamlessly integrated with off-the-shelf texture generation tools, yielding textured results with visually pleasing appearance. We believe this approach represents an important step towards fully automated, industry-quality, large-scale 3D content generation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The expansive nature of BlockFusion allows it to serve as a map generator for open-world games. We integrate BlockFusion to Unity to develop such an open-world game, where players can roam and explore the world freely without being restricted by a predetermined world boundary. A demo of this can be found in the supplementary video.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '**Limitations.** The current implementation of BlockFusion faces several limitations. Our method may fail to generate very fine geometric details in the scene, such as the legs of a chair. This issue primarily stems from the limited resolution used for the tri-planes. A possible solution is to adopt tri-plane super-resolution. Moreover, the bounding box condition can only control the approximate placement of objects, not their orientations. We believe that precise orientation control could be achieved by training diffusion conditioning on both the bounding box map and an object orientation map. This orientation map can also be easily obtained from user instructions. Lastly, while we have demonstrated textured mesh results on small scenes, the task of generating globally consistent textures for large scene meshes is both a challenging and intriguing future endeavor.\n' +
