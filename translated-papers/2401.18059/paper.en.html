      '\n' +
      'Retrieval-augmented language models can better adapt to changes in world state and incorporate long-tail knowledge. However, most existing methods retrieve only short contiguous chunks from a retrieval corpus, limiting holistic understanding of the overall document context. We introduce the novel approach of recursively embedding, clustering, and summarizing chunks of text, constructing a tree with differing levels of summarization from the bottom up. At inference time, our RAPTOR model retrieves from this tree, integrating information across lengthy documents at different levels of abstraction. Controlled experiments show that retrieval with recursive summaries offers significant improvements over traditional retrieval-augmented LMs on several tasks. On question-answering tasks that involve complex, multi-step reasoning, we show state-of-the-art results; for example, by coupling RAPTOR retrieval with the use of GPT-4, we can improve the best performance on the QuALITY benchmark by 20% in absolute accuracy.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools showing impressive performance on many tasks. With the growing size of LLMs, they can serve standalone as very effective knowledge stores, with facts encoded within their parameters (Petroni et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2020; Talmor et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023; Kandpal et al., 2023) and models can be further improved with fine-tuning on downstream tasks (Roberts et al., 2020). Nevertheless, even a large model does not contain sufficient domain-specific knowledge for particular tasks and the world continues to change, invalidating facts in the LLM. Updating the knowledge of these models through additional fine-tuning or editing is difficult, particularly when dealing with vast text corpora (Lewis et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2022). An alternative approach, pioneered in open domain question answering systems (Chen et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2018), is to index large quantities of text, after splitting it into chunks (paragraphs), in a separate information retrieval system. Retrieved information is then presented to the LLM along with the question as context ("retrieval augmentation", Lewis et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Min et al., 2023; Ram et al., 2023), making it easy to provide a system with current knowledge particular to some domain and enabling easy interpretability and provenance tracking, whereas the parametric knowledge of LLMs is opaque and difficult to trace back to its source (Akyurek et al., 2022).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Nevertheless, existing retrieval-augmented approaches also have flaws. The one we tackle is that most existing methods retrieve only a few short, contiguous text chunks, which limits their ability to represent and leverage large-scale discourse structure. This is particularly relevant for thematic questions that require integrating knowledge from multiple parts of a text, such as understanding an entire book, as in the NarrativeQA dataset (Kocisky et al., 2018). Consider the fairy tale of Cinderella, and the question "How did Cinderella reach her happy ending?". The top-\\(k\\) retrieved short contiguous texts will not contain enough context to answer the question.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To address this, we design an indexing and retrieval system that uses a tree structure to capture both high-level and low-level details about a text. As shown in Figure 1, our system, RAPTOR, clusters chunks of text, generates text summaries of those clusters, and then repeats, generating a tree from the bottom up. This structure enables RAPTOR to load into an LLM\'s context chunks representing the text at different levels so that it can effectively and efficiently answer questions at different levels.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our main contribution is the idea of using text summarization to allow retrieval augmentation of context at different scales, and to show its effectiveness in experiments on collections of long documents. Controlled experiments with three language models (UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020), GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)) show that RAPTOR outperforms current retrieval augmentation. Moreover, RAPTOR coupled with GPT-4, and sometimes even with UnifiedQA, gives new state-of-the-art results on three QA tasks: free text response questions on books and movies (NarrativeQA, Kocisky et al., 2018), full-text NLP papers (QASPER, Dasigi et al., 2021), and multiple-choice questions based on medium-length passages (QuALITY, Pang et al., 2022).1\n' +

      'Footnote 1: We will release the code of RAPTOR publicly here.\n' +

      '## 2 Related Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Why Retrieval?Recent advances in hardware and algorithms have indeed expanded the context lengths that models can handle, leading to questions about the need for retrieval systems (Dai et al., 2019; Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). However, as Liu et al. (2023) and Sun et al. (2021) have noted, models tend to underutilize long-range context and see diminishing performance as context length increases, especially when pertinent information is embedded within a lengthy context. Moreover, practically, use of long contexts is expensive and slow. This suggests that selecting the most relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks is still crucial.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Retrieval MethodsRetrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have seen improvements in various components: the retriever, the reader, and end-to-end system training. Retrieval methods have transitioned from traditional term-based techniques like **TF-IDF**(Sparck Jones, 1972) and **BM25**(Robertson et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2020) to deep learning-based strategies (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Khattab & Zaharia, 2020; Sachan et al., 2023). Some recent work proposes using large language models as retrievers due to their ability to memorize extensive knowledge (Yu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022). Research on the reader component includes **Fusion-in-Decoder (FID)**(Izacard & Grave, 2022), which employs both DPR and BM25 for retrieval and processes passages independently in the encoder and **RETRO**(Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), which utilizes cross-chunked attention and chunkwise retrieval to generate text grounded on retrieved context.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'End-to-end system training work includes **Atlas**(Izacard et al., 2022), which fine-tunes an encoder-decoder model in conjunction with the retriever; **REALM**(Guu et al., 2020), a bidirectional, masked LM fine-tuned for open-domain question answering; and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**(Lewis et al., 2020), which integrates pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models with a neural retriever. Min et al. (2021) introduced **Joint Passage Retrieval (JPR)** model which uses a tree-decoding algorithm to handle passage diversity and relevance in multi-answer retrieval. **Dense Hierarchical Retrieval (DHR)** and **Hybrid Hierarchical Retrieval (HHR)** represent advancements in retrieval accuracy by combining document and passage level retrievals and integrating sparse and dense retrieval methods, respectively (Liu et al., 2021; Arivazhagan et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: **Tree construction process: RAPTOR recursively clusters chunks of text based on their vector embeddings and generates text summaries of those clusters, constructing a tree from the bottom up. Nodes clustered together are siblings; a parent node contains the text summary of that cluster.**\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Despite a diversity in methods, the retrieving components of models predominantly rely on standard approaches, i.e., chunking corpora and encoding with BERT-based retrievers. Although this approach is widely adopted, Nair et al. (2023) highlights a potential shortcoming: contiguous segmentation might not capture the complete semantic depth of the text. Reading extracted snippets from technical or scientific documents may lack important context making them difficult to read or even misleading. Cohan & Goharian (2017); Newman et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Recursive summarization as ContextSummarization techniques provide a condensed view of documents, enabling more focused engagement with the content Angelidis & Lapata (2018). The summarization/snippet model by Gao et al. (2023) uses summarizations and snippets of passages, which improves correctness on most datasets but can sometimes be a lossy means of compression. The recursive-abstractive summarization model by Wu et al. (2021) employs task decomposition to summarize smaller text chunks, which are later integrated to form summaries of larger sections. While this method is effective for capturing broader themes, it can miss granular details. LlamaIndex Liu (2022) mitigates this issue by similarly summarizing adjacent text chunks but also retaining intermediate nodes thus storing varying levels of detail, keeping granular details. However, both methods, due to their reliance on adjacency for grouping or summarizing adjacent nodes, may still overlook distant interdependencies within the text, which we can find and group with RAPTOR.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 3 Methods\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Overview of RAPTORBuilding on the idea that long texts often present subtopics and hierarchical structures Cao & Wang (2022); Dong et al. (2023), RAPTOR addresses the issue of semantic depth and connection in reading by building a recursive tree structure that balances broader thematic comprehension with granular details and which allows nodes to be grouped based on semantic similarity not just order in the text.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Construction of the RAPTOR tree begins with segmenting the retrieval corpus into short, contiguous texts of length 100, similar to traditional retrieval augmentation techniques. If a sentence exceeds the 100-token limit, we move the entire sentence to the next chunk, rather than cutting it mid-sentence. This preserves the contextual and semantic coherence of the text within each chunk. These texts are then embedded using SBERT, a BERT-based encoder (multi-qa-mpnet-base-cos-v1) Reimers & Gurevych (2019). The chunks and their corresponding SBERT embeddings form the leaf nodes of our tree structure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To group similar text chunks, we employ a clustering algorithm. Once clustered, a Language Model is used to summarize the grouped texts. These summarized texts are then re-embedded, and the cycle of embedding, clustering, and summarization continues until further clustering becomes infeasible, resulting in a structured, multi-layered tree representation of the original documents. An important aspect of RAPTOR is its computational efficiency. The system scales linearly in terms of both build time and token expenditure, making it suitable for processing large and complex corpora. For a comprehensive discussion on RAPTOR\'s scalability, please refer to the Appendix A.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'For querying within this tree, we introduce two distinct strategies: tree traversal and collapsed tree. The tree traversal method traverses the tree layer-by-layer, pruning and selecting the most relevant nodes at each level. The collapsed tree method evaluates nodes collectively across all layers to find the most relevant ones.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Clustering AlgorithmClustering plays a key role in building the RAPTOR tree, organizing text segments into cohesive groups. This step groups related content together, which helps the subsequent retrieval process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One of the unique aspects of our clustering approach is the use of soft clustering, where nodes can belong to multiple clusters without requiring a fixed number of clusters. This flexibility is essential because individual text segments often contain information relevant to various topics, thereby warranting their inclusion in multiple summaries.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our clustering algorithm is based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), an approach that offers both flexibility and a probabilistic framework. GMMs assume that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Given a set of \\(N\\) text segments, each represented as a \\(d\\)-dimensional dense vector embedding, the likelihood of a text vector, \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), given its membership in the \\(k^{th}\\) Gaussian distribution, is denoted by \\(P(\\mathbf{x}|k)=\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x};\\mu_{k},\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{k})\\). The overall probability distribution is a weighted combination \\(P(\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\kappa}\\pi_{k}\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x};\\mu_{k}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{k})\\), where \\(\\pi_{k}\\) signifies the mixture weight for the \\(k^{\\mathrm{th}}\\) Gaussian distribution.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The high dimensionality of vector embeddings presents a challenge for traditional GMMs, as distance metrics may behave poorly when used to measure similarity in high-dimensional spaces (Aggarwal et al., 2001). To mitigate this, we employ Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), a manifold learning technique for dimensionality reduction (McInnes et al., 2018). The number of nearest neighbors parameter, \\(n\\_neighbors\\), in UMAP determines the balance between the preservation of local and global structures. Our algorithm varies \\(n\\_neighbors\\) to create a hierarchical clustering structure: it first identifies global clusters and then performs local clustering within these global clusters. This two-step clustering process captures a broad spectrum of relationships among the text data, from broad themes to specific details.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Should a local cluster\'s combined context ever exceed the summarization model\'s token threshold, our algorithm recursively applies clustering within the cluster, ensuring that the context remains within the token threshold.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To determine the optimal number of clusters, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection. BIC not only penalizes model complexity but also rewards goodness of fit (Schwarz, 1978). The BIC for a given GMM is \\(BIC=\\ln(N)k-2\\ln(\\hat{L})\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of text segments (or data points), \\(k\\) is the number of model parameters, and \\(\\hat{L}\\) is the maximized value of the likelihood function of the model. In the context of GMM, the number of parameters \\(k\\) is a function of the dimensionality of the input vectors and the number of clusters.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'With the optimal number of clusters determined by BIC, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is then used to estimate the GMM parameters, namely the means, covariances, and mixture weights.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While the Gaussian assumption in GMMs may not perfectly align with the nature of text data, which often exhibits a sparse and skewed distribution, our empirical observations suggest that it offers an effective model for our purpose. We run an ablation comparing GMM Clustering with summarizing contiguous chunks and provide details in Appendix B.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Model-Based SummarizationAfter clustering the nodes using Gaussian Mixture Models, the nodes in each cluster are sent to a language model for summarization. This step allows the model to transform large chunks of text into concise, coherent summaries of the selected nodes. For our experiments, we use gpt-3.5-turbo to generate the summaries. The summarization step condenses the potentially large volume of retrieved information into a manageable size. We provide statistics on the compression due to the summarization in Appendix C and the prompt used for summarization in Appendix D.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While the summarization model generally produces reliable summaries, a focused annotation study revealed that about 4% of the summaries contained minor hallucinations. These did not propagate to parent nodes and had no discernible impact on question-answering tasks. For an in-depth analysis of hallucinations, refer to the appendix E.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'QueryingIn this section, we elaborate on the two querying mechanisms employed by RAPTOR: tree traversal and collapsed tree. These methods offer unique ways of traversing the multi-layered RAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. We provide the pseudocode of both methods in Appendix F. Note that we embed all nodes using SBERT.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **tree traversal** method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are considered at the next layer and the top-k nodes are selected from this pool again based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated until we reach the leaf nodes. Finally, the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. The algorithm\'s steps are outlined below:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. Start at the root layer of the RAPTOR tree. Compute the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of all nodes present at this initial layer.\n' +
      '2. Choose the top-\\(k\\) nodes based on the highest cosine similarity scores, forming the set \\(S_{1}\\).\n' +
      '\n' +
      '3. Proceed to the child nodes of the elements in set \\(S_{1}\\). Compute the cosine similarity between the query vector and the vector embeddings of these child nodes.\n' +
      '4. Select the top \\(k\\) child nodes with the highest cosine similarity scores to the query, forming the set \\(S_{2}\\).\n' +
      '5. Continue this process recursively for \\(d\\) layers, producing sets \\(S_{1},S_{2},\\dots,S_{d}\\).\n' +
      '6. Concatenate sets \\(S_{1}\\) through \\(S_{d}\\) to assemble the relevant context to the query.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'By adjusting the depth \\(d\\) and the number of nodes \\(k\\) selected at each layer, the tree traversal method offers control over the specificity and breadth of the information retrieved. The algorithm starts with a broad outlook by considering the top layers of the tree and progressively focuses on finer details as it descends through the lower layers.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The **collapsed tree** approach offers a simpler way to search for relevant information by considering all nodes in the tree simultaneously, as depicted in Figure 2. Instead of going layer-by-layer, this method flattens the multi-layered tree into a single layer, essentially bringing all the nodes onto the same level for comparison. The steps for this method are outlined below:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '1. First, collapse the entire RAPTOR tree into a single layer. This new set of nodes, denoted as \\(C\\), contains nodes from every layer of the original tree.\n' +
      '2. Next, calculate the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of all nodes present in the collapsed set \\(C\\).\n' +
      '3. Finally, pick the top-\\(k\\) nodes that have the highest cosine similarity scores with the query. Keep adding nodes to the result set until you reach a predefined maximum number of tokens, ensuring you don\'t exceed the model\'s input limitations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We tested both approaches on 20 stories from the QASPER dataset. Figure 3 shows the performance of tree traversal with different top- sizes and collapsed tree with different maximum token numbers. The collapsed tree approach consistently performs better. We believe collapsed tree retrieval is better due to offering greater flexibility than tree traversal; i.e., by searching through all the nodes simultaneously, it retrieves information that is at the correct level of granularity for a given question. In comparison, while using tree traversal with the same values of \\(d\\) and \\(k\\), the ratio of nodes from each level of the tree will be constant. So, the ratio of higher-order thematic information to granular details will remain the same regardless of the question.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: **Illustration of the tree traversal and collapsed tree retrieval mechanisms. Tree traversal starts at the root level of the tree and retrieves the top-\\(k\\) (here, top-1) node(s) based on cosine similarity to the query vector. At each level, it retrieves the top-\\(k\\) node(s) from the child nodes of the previous layer’s top-\\(k\\). Collapsed tree collapses the tree into a single layer and retrieves nodes until a threshold number of tokens is reached, based on cosine similarity to the query vector. The nodes on which cosine similarity search is performed are highlighted in both illustrations.**\n' +
      '\n' +
      'One drawback, however, of the collapsed tree approach is that it requires cosine similarity search to be performed on all nodes in the tree. However, this can be made more efficient with fast \\(k\\)-nearest neighbor libraries such as FAISS (Johnson et al., 2019).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Overall, given the collapsed tree approach\'s greater flexibility and its superior performance on the subset of the QASPER dataset, this is the querying approach with which we proceed. Specifically, we use the collapsed tree with 2000 maximum tokens, which approximately equates to retrieving the top-20 nodes. Using a token-based approach ensures the context does not exceed model context constraints as token counts can vary across nodes. For experiments with the UnifiedQA model, we provide 400 tokens of context, as UnifiedQA has a max context length of 512 tokens. We provide the same amount of tokens of context to RAPTOR and to the baselines.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Qualitative StudyWe conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the benefits of RAPTOR\'s retrieval process compared to Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) methods. Our study focuses on thematic, multi-hop questions using a 1500-word Cinderella fairytale. As illustrated in Figure 4, RAPTOR\'s tree-based retrieval allows it to choose nodes from different tree layers, matching the question\'s detail level. This approach often yields more relevant and comprehensive information for downstream tasks than DPR. For a detailed discussion and examples, including the text retrieved by both RAPTOR and DPR for specific questions, please refer to the appendix G.\n' +

      '## 4 Experiments\n' +
      '\n' +
      'DatasetsWe measure RAPTOR\'s performance across three question-answering datasets: NarrativeQA, QASPER, and QuALITY.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'NarrativeQA is a dataset that comprises question-answer pairs based on the full texts of books and movie transcripts, totaling 1,572 documents (Kocisky et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021). The NarrativeQA-Story task requires a comprehensive understanding of the entire narrative in order to accurately answer its questions, thus testing the model\'s ability to comprehend longer texts in the literary domain. We measure performance on this dataset using the standard BLEU (B-1, B-4), ROUGE (R-L), and METEOR (M) metrics. Please see appendix H for more details on the NarrativeQA evaluation script used in our experiments.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The QASPER dataset includes 5,049 questions across 1,585 NLP papers, with each question probing for information embedded within the full text (Dasigi et al., 2021). The answer types in QASPER are categorized as Answerable/Unanswerable, Yes/No, Abstractive, and Extractive. Accuracy is measured using standard F1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Lastly, the QuALITY dataset consists of multiple-choice questions, each accompanied by context passages averaging approximately 5,000 tokens in length (Pang et al., 2022). This dataset calls for reasoning over the entire document for QA tasks, enabling us to measure the performance of our retrieval system on medium-length documents. The dataset includes a challenging subset, QuALITY-HARD, which contains questions that a majority of human annotators answered incorrectly in a speed-setting. We report accuracies for both the entire test set and the HARD subset.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Controlled Baseline ComparisonsWe first present controlled comparisons using the UnifiedQA 3B as the reader, with SBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995; 2009), and DPR (Karpukhin et al., 2020) as the embedding models with and without the RAPTOR tree structure, on three datasets: QASPER, NarrativeQA, and QuALITY. As shown in Tables 1 and 2,\n' +

      'Figure 3: **Comparison of querying methods.** Results on 20 stories from the QASPER dataset using tree traversal with different top-k values, and collapsed tree with different context lengths. Collapsed tree with 2000 tokens produces the best results, so we use this querying strategy for our main results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'our results demonstrate that RAPTOR, when combined with any retriever, consistently outperforms the respective retriever across all datasets. 2\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 2: For the DPR experiments in Tables 1 and 2, we used the dpr-multiset-base model as opposed to dpr-single-nd-base which was used in rest of the experiments done earlier. This decision was based on the performance observed in Karpukhin et al. (2020), where dpr-multiset-base showed superior results.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Since RAPTOR with SBERT has the best performance, we use it in all subsequent experiments. We now compare RAPTOR with BM25 and DPR, using three different LLMs: GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA. As shown in Table 3, RAPTOR consistently outperforms BM25 and DPR across all three Language Models on the QASPER dataset. RAPTOR\'s F-1 Match scores are 53.1%, 55.7%, and 36.6% when using GPT-3, GPT-4, and UnifiedQA, respectively. These scores surpass DPR by margins of 1.8, 2.7, and 4.5 points, and undo BM25 by 6.5, 5.5, and 10.2 points across the respective LLMs. QASPER requires synthesizing information within NLP papers, so it is unsurprising that RAPTOR\'s higher-level summary nodes would allow it to outperform methods that can only extract the top-\\(k\\) most similar raw chunks of text, which may not contain the correct response in isolation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Likewise, in the QuALITY dataset as shown in Table 4, RAPTOR achieves an accuracy of 62.4%, which is a 2% and 5.1% improvement over DPR and BM25. Similar trends are observed when UnifiedQA is employed, with RAPTOR outperforming DPR and BM25 by 2.7% and 6.7%, respectively.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Finally, in the NarrativeQA dataset, as presented in Table 6, RAPTOR excels across multiple metrics. For ROUGE-L, it surpasses BM25 and DPR by 7.3 and 2.7 points, respectively. In other metrics like BLEU-1, BLEU-4, and METEOR, RAPTOR outperforms BM25 and DPR by margins ranging from 1.7 to 5.8 and 0.7 to 2.1 points, respectively.\n' +

To quantitatively understand the contribution of the upper-level nodes, we used stories from the QuALITY dataset. The RAPTOR tree is built for each of these stories, as described in Section 3. However, during retrieval, we limit the search to different subsets of layers. For example, we exclusively retrieve from the leaf nodes and each upper layer, as well as from different contiguous subsets of the layers. We show findings specific to one story in Table 8, revealing that a full-tree search, utilizing all layers, outperformed retrieval strategies that focused only on specific layers.\n' +

By providing both the original text and higher-level summaries for retrieval, RAPTOR can effectively handle a wider range of questions, from higher-order thematic queries to detail-oriented questions. Detailed results for additional stories and an ablation study on layer contributions can be found in Appendix I.\n' +

      '## 5 Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we have presented RAPTOR, a novel tree-based retrieval system that augments the parametric knowledge of large language models with contextual information at various levels of abstraction. By employing recursive clustering and summarization techniques, RAPTOR creates a hierarchical tree structure that is capable of synthesizing information across various sections of the retrieval corpora. During the query phase, RAPTOR leverages this tree structure for more effective retrieval. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that RAPTOR not only outperforms traditional retrieval methods but also sets new performance benchmarks on several question-answering tasks.\n' +

      '## Appendix A Scalability and Computational Efficiency of the Tree-Building Process\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To assess the computational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of RAPTOR\'s tree-building process, we conducted experiments on a consumer-grade laptop, specifically an Apple M1 Mac with 16GB of RAM. These experiments aimed to demonstrate the scalability and feasibility of RAPTOR on typical hardware. We varied the context length from 12,500 to 78,000 tokens and measured both the token expenditure and the time required to complete the tree-building process, from initial splitting and embedding to the construction of the final root node.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Token ExpenditureWe empirically investigated the relationship between the initial document length and the total number of tokens expended during the tree-building process, which includes both the prompt and completion tokens. The document lengths varied significantly across the three\n' +

      '\n' +
      'datasets examined: QuALITY, QASPER, and NarrativeQA. Figure 5 illustrates a clear linear correlation between the initial document length and the total token expenditure, emphasizing that RAPTOR maintains a linear token scaling regardless of document complexity or length.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Build TimeWe also empirically observed a consistent linear trend between the document length and the build time, as shown in Figure 6. This suggests that RAPTOR scales linearly in terms of time, making it a viable solution for efficiently processing large corpora of varying lengths.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'ConclusionOverall, our empirical results indicate that RAPTOR scales both in terms of tokens expended and build time. Even as the complexity and volume of the input text grow, the cost of constructing the tree scales predictably and linearly. This demonstrates that RAPTOR is computationally efficient and well-suited for processing large and diverse corpora.\n' +

      '## Appendix B Ablation Study on Clustering Mechanism in RAPTOR\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To assess the effectiveness of the clustering mechanism in our RAPTOR approach, we conducted an ablation study on the QuALITY dataset. This study compares RAPTOR\'s performance with a balanced tree-style encoding and summarization of contiguous chunks, in contrast to our standard clustering method.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Methodology\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Both configurations in this ablation study utilized SBERT embeddings and UnifiedQA to maintain consistency in retrieval. For RAPTOR, we employed our typical clustering and summarization process. In contrast, the alternative setup involved creating a balanced tree by recursively encoding and summarizing contiguous text chunks. We determined the window size for this setup based on the average cluster size observed in RAPTOR, which is approximately 6.7 nodes. Hence, we chose a window size of 7 nodes. The collapsed tree approach was applied for retrieval in both models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Results & Discussion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The results of the ablation study are presented in table 9. The results from this ablation study clearly indicate an improvement in accuracy when employing RAPTOR\'s clustering mechanism over the recency-based tree approach. This finding substantiates our hypothesis that the clustering strategy in RAPTOR is more effective in capturing homogeneous content for summarization, thereby enhancing the overall retrieval performance.\n' +

      '## Appendix E Hallucination Analysis\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To assess the quality and accuracy of the summarizations within our RAPTOR model, we conducted an analysis focusing on hallucinations in the generated summaries. The summaries were generated by gpt-3.5-turbo and subsequently annotated to quantify the rates of hallucinations, to examine whether such inaccuracies propagate to parent nodes, and to evaluate their impact on question-answering (QA) tasks.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Methodology\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We randomly sampled 150 nodes across 40 stories and evaluated them for hallucinations. This sampling strategy provides a broad view of the model\'s performance across different contexts. Each node was annotated by hand, and determined if it contained a hallucination.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Findings\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Out of the 150 nodes sampled, 4% (6 nodes) contained some form of hallucination. Most commonly, these hallucinations originated from the model adding minor information possibly from its training data that was not present in the text being summarized, or from incorrectly extrapolating some information when creating the summary.\n' +

      'significantly impacts downstream tasks. When GPT-4 is provided with RAPTOR\'s context, it generates a detailed answer: "Cinderella finds a happy ending when the Prince searches for the owner of the lost glass slipper and discovers it belongs to Cinderella. They eventually marry, transforming Cinderella\'s life for the better." In contrast, using DPR\'s context, GPT-4 states: "Based on the given context, it is not possible to determine how Cinderella finds a happy ending, as the text lacks information about the story\'s conclusion."\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The second question we examine is "What is the central theme of the story?", a thematic question that requires holistic understanding of the entire text. The text retrieved by RAPTOR and DPR for this question is shown in Table 13. The text retrieved by RAPTOR contains short descriptions of all the major parts of the story, whereas the text retrieved by DPR contains detailed descriptions of a narrow subset of the story. Again, the difference in retrieval mechanisms affects the performance of GPT-4 when answering the question. Given DPR\'s context, it outputs "The central theme of the story is transformation and the power of inner beauty, as Cinderella, a kind and humble girl, is magically transformed into a beautiful princess, capturing the attention and admiration of the Prince and others at the ball." This answer only takes into account the first portion of the story, up until Cinderella first meets the Prince. In contrast, given RAPTOR\'s context, GPT-4 outputs "The central theme of the story is transformation and overcoming adversity, as Cinderella, with the help of her Fairy Godmother, transforms from a mistreated and downtrodden girl into a beautiful and confident young woman who ultimately finds happiness and love with the Prince." This is a more complete answer, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the story.\n' +

A BLEU score of zero skews the results, leading to an overly harsh evaluation for rare or novel phrases. By addinga smoothing function, we prevent the BLEU scores from dropping to zero, providing a more fair evaluation.\n' +

This approach may overly focus on 4-gram matches while neglecting lower-order matches. To provide a more balanced evaluation, we evenly distributed the weight across all n-gram levels, changing the weights for the BLEU-4 calculation to (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25).\n' +

      'We further conduct an ablation study across all three datasets and across three different retrievers with RAPTOR with the collapsed tree retrieval to examine the layers from which the retrieved nodes originate. We observe that between 18.5% to 57% of the retrieved nodes come from non-leaf nodes. As illustrated in Figure 7, the retrieval pattern across layers reveals the importance of RAPTOR\'s multi-layered tree structure. Notably, a significant percentage of the nodes retrieved by RAPTOR using the DPR retriever for the NarrativeQA dataset come from the first and second layers of the tree, as opposed to the leaf nodes. This pattern is consistent across the other datasets and retrievers, albeit with varying percentages.\n' +
