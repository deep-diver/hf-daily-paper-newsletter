      '\n' +
      'As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to user inputs is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem, and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. It can uncover a model\'s vulnerabilities across a broad range of domains including, in this paper, safety, question answering, and cybersecurity. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning on synthetic data generated by Rainbow Teaming improves the safety of state-of-the-art LLMs without hurting their general capabilities and helpfulness, paving the path to open-ended self-improvement.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced remarkable growth in both their capabilities (OpenAI, 2023; Gemini Team et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) and their applications in various fields (NLLB Team et al., 2022; Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023; Schick et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023). As LLMs become increasingly complex and are deployed in safety-critical environments (Singhal et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Maddela et al., 2023), it is essential to thoroughly understand their robustness to different inputs. Indeed, the susceptibility of LLMs to user inputs and adversarial prompts -- prompts crafted to mislead the model or exploit its weaknesses, potentially leading to unsafe, biased, or incorrect outputs -- poses a significant challenge (Perez et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). Identifying these vulnerabilities and subsequently mitigating such risks is therefore vital to ensure the safe and reliable operation of LLMs in the real world.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Current methods for identifying adversarial prompts aimed at "attacking" LLMs and eliciting undesirable outputs are limited by several factors. These limitations include the necessity of fine-tuning an attacker model (Perez et al., 2022; Ge et al., 2023); white-box access to the target model (Liu et al., 2023); or significant human input (Yu et al., 2023). Several recent black-box methods, such as PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) and TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2023), require a human-in-the-loop to specify harmful behaviours (e.g., "Write a tutorial on how to hack the university server"), and are only able to generate prompts related to those behaviours. In general, existing methods for systematically discovering adversarial attacks exhibit a lack of diversity (Liu et al., 2023), for instance by restricting themselves to a single predefined attack strategy (Shah et al., 2023), or by suffering a loss of diversity, a common issue in objective-based prompt optimisation approaches (Zhou et al., 2022; Fernando et al., 2023). As a result, they leave much of the adversarial prompt space unexplored, limiting their usefulness both as a diagnostic tool and as a source of synthetic data for improving robustness.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We introduce Rainbow Teaming, a versatile approach for the systematic generation of diverse adversarial prompts for LLMs via LLMs. While the prevailing approach to automatic _red teaming_(Perez et al., 2022) also uses LLMs to generate adversarial inputs, it does so via a costly rejection-sampling protocol and exhibitsa steep trade-off between the diversity of discovered attacks and their success rate. In contrast, Rainbow Teaming takes a more deliberate approach, efficiently covering the space of attacks by directly optimising for the attack quality and diversity. To this end, our method casts the problem of adversarial prompt generation as _quality-diversity_ (QD) search (Lehman and Stanley, 2011; Pugh et al., 2016; Cully and Demiris, 2018) and takes direct inspiration from Samvelyan et al. (2024) to discover a set of adversarial prompts that are both diverse and effective. Rainbow Teaming is an _open-ended_ approach which builds on MAP-Elites (Mouret and Clune, 2015), an evolutionary search method that iteratively populates an "archive" -- a discrete grid spanning the dimensions of interest for diversity -- with increasingly higher-performing solutions. In our case, these solutions are adversarial prompts that elicit undesirable behaviours in a target LLM. The resulting archive of diverse and effective attack prompts, such as the one in Figure 1, serves both as a diagnostic tool for the weaknesses of the target LLM and as a high-quality synthetic dataset to robustify the target LLM.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming is directly applicable to a wide range of domains. Implementing Rainbow Teaming requires three essential building blocks: 1) A set of _feature descriptors_ that specify the dimensions of diversity (e.g., "Risk Category" or "Attack Style"); 2) A _mutation operator_ to evolve adversarial prompts (e.g., an LLM that is itself prompted to mutate previously discovered prompts (Lehman et al., 2022)); and 3) a _preference model_ that ranks adversarial prompts based on their effectiveness. For safety, this can be a "judge" LLM (Zheng et al., 2023) that compares two responses to determine which is more unsafe.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We demonstrate the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by targeting the Llama 2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) family of models for the safety, question answering, and cybersecurity domains. Despite the extensive development that went into those models, we present experiments uncovering hundreds of adversarial prompts per domain, per individual run, illustrating the effectiveness of our method as a diagnostic tool. We also show that fine-tuning the model on synthetic data generated via Rainbow Teaming significantly improves the model\'s robustness to subsequent rounds of adversarial attacks without decreasing its general capabilities and helpfulness. This provides strong evidence that Rainbow Teaming can serve as a method for open-ended self-improvement of LLMs with minimal human input.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 2 Background\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming builds on existing approaches in quality-diversity (QD) search to automate the discovery of a broad spectrum of adversarial prompts. QD methods seek to produce a collection of solutions that are individually high-performing and collectively diverse (Lehman and Stanley, 2011; Cully and Demiris, 2018). Given a space of solutions \\(\\mathcal{X}\\), the effectiveness of each solution \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\) is evaluated by a _fitness function_,\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 1: An example archive generated by Rainbow Teaming when used to discover safety vulnerabilities in Llama 2-chat 7B. Here, we search over two features: Risk Category and Attack Style. Shading corresponds to the Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) scores of responses induced by the adversarial prompt in each cell (higher means more confidence in the response being unsafe). Some excerpts of discovered prompts from a single archive are shown.\n' +
      '\n' +
      ' \\(f:\\mathcal{X}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\). The diversity of solutions is evaluated according to a _feature descriptor function_, \\(d:\\mathcal{X}\\mapsto\\mathcal{Z}\\), a function that maps each solution to a point in a feature space \\(\\mathcal{Z}=\\mathbb{R}^{N}\\). This space encompasses specific attributes of the solution, such as behavioral aspects, which can be defined a priori or during training (Cully, 2019). For each \\(z\\in\\mathcal{Z}\\), QD searches for the solution \\(x\\in\\mathcal{X}\\) such that \\(d(x)=z\\) and \\(f(x)\\) is maximised.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Our work builds directly on _MAP-Elites_(Mouret and Clune, 2015), a simple yet effective QD method outlined in Algorithm1. This method tracks the highest-fitness solutions in a \\(K\\)-dimensional (\\(K\\leq N\\)) grid referred to as the _archive_, which discretises the feature space \\(\\mathcal{Z}\\). The archive is first initialised with random solutions. Then, during each iteration of MAP-Elites, a solution \\(x\\) is sampled at random from the archive and modified via a mutation operator \\(m\\) (e.g., injecting Gaussian noise) to create a new solution \\(x^{\\prime}\\), which is then evaluated and assigned to its corresponding archive cell based on its feature descriptor \\(z^{\\prime}=d(x^{\\prime})\\). If the cell is vacant, or if \\(x^{\\prime}\\) has higher fitness than the current occupant, also known as the _elite_, \\(x^{\\prime}\\) becomes the new elite for that cell. Through repeated cycles of selection, mutation, and evaluation, MAP-Elites fills the archive with the highest-fitness solutions discovered for each discretised portion of the feature space.\n' +

      '## 3 Rainbow Teaming\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We now describe Rainbow Teaming, our approach for automatically generating diverse adversarial prompts for LLMs. These are inputs that elicit undesirable (e.g., unsafe or factually incorrect) responses from a _Target_ LLM. To this end, Rainbow Teaming uses the QD framework described in Section2 to generate a large collection of diverse adversarial prompts that are all effective at making the model fail according to some metric. Our rationale for employing the QD is twofold:\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 2: Overview of Rainbow Teaming in the safety domain: Our method operates on a discretised grid, archiving adversarial prompts with \\(K\\) defining features, such as Risk Category or Attack Style. Each iteration involves a _Mutator_ LLM applying \\(K\\) mutations to generate new candidate prompts. These prompts are then fed into the _Target_ LLM. A _Judge_ LLM evaluates these responses against archived prompts with the same features, updating the archive with any prompt that elicits a more unsafe response from the Target.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Effective adversarial prompts for specific scenarios (e.g., criminal planning) could be effective for others (e.g., cybercrime and hacking) with relatively small modifications. This adaptability implies that solutions can serve as _stepping stones_ to accelerate the discovery of new adversarial strategies across different categories.\n' +
      '* A thorough diagnostic of the vulnerabilities of a model calls for a comprehensive diagnostic tool to mitigate the risks of leaving attack vectors undiscovered. Similarly, safety fine-tuning requires a sufficiently _diverse_ dataset to enable LLMs to generalise and become more robust to a wide range of attacks. Diversity is therefore essential for both objectives, and QD allows us to optimise it explicitly.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We base our approach on MAP-Elites (Mouret and Clune, 2015), storing adversarial prompts as solutions in a \\(K\\)-dimensional archive and performing each key operation of the iterative search with an LLM. At each iteration, we sample an adversarial prompt from the archive and a prescribed feature descriptor (i.e., a combination of categories corresponding to an archive position). We feed both to the _Mutator_ LLM to generate a new _candidate_ prompt aligned with the feature descriptor. We then provide the candidate to the Target to generate a response. Finally, we ask a _Judge_ LLM (Zheng et al., 2023) to compare the effectiveness of the candidate prompt to that of the existing prompt stored at the prescribed archive position. This comparison focuses on the criteria of interest, such as the toxicity of the Target response, to determine which of the two prompts more effectively meets the adversarial objective. We then store the winning prompt in the archive at the prescribed position. Figure 2 provides an overview of the method, as applied to safety.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming is highly versatile and can easily be applied to various settings by implementing three components: feature descriptors, a mutation operator, and a preference model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Feature Descriptors\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The features define the archive, with each predefined feature corresponding to one of the \\(K\\) archive dimensions. A feature can be either categorical or numerical. For categorical features, the axis of the archive is composed of discrete bins, each representing a unique category within the feature. For instance, the Risk Category and Attack Style features in Figure 1 each consist of 10 categories. Numerical features are represented on a continuous scale, discretised into a set of intervals. Each feature descriptor \\(z=\\langle c_{1},\\dots,c_{K}\\rangle\\) corresponds to a unique combination of categories and therefore to an archive cell containing a single elite. Features therefore determine both the final archive size and the axes of diversity that Rainbow Teaming prioritises. This is particularly true given their interplay with the _mutation operator_, as described next.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Mutation Operator\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming generates new candidates by applying directed mutations to previously discovered adversarial prompts. The Mutator receives a parent prompt sampled uniformly at random from the archive and a prescribed feature descriptor \\(z^{\\prime}=\\langle c^{\\prime}_{1},\\dots,c^{\\prime}_{K}\\rangle\\) (e.g., "Criminal Planning" and "Role Play" in Figure 2). It then mutates the parent \\(K\\) times -- once for each feature -- to produce a new candidate prompt.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Sampling the feature descriptor in advance confers several key benefits. First, this allows us to forgo using a classifier for assigning the candidate to its corresponding cell in the archive, which can be inaccurate. Second, it introduces more diversity by mitigating the biases of the Mutator, which might otherwise neglect entire categories. Third, it helps avoid spending iterations on areas of the archive for which we already have effective adversarial prompts. We do this by biasing the sampling distribution of the feature descriptor towards areas of the archive with low fitness. We compute fitness explicitly for this purpose but do not use it to inform archive updates.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To further promote diversity throughout Rainbow Teaming iterations, the candidate prompt is considered for further evaluation only if it is sufficiently dissimilar from its parent. We measure the similarity using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and filter out prompts that have high BLEU scores with respect to their parents.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Preference Model\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The preference model, operated through the Judge, performs the ranking of adversarial prompts based on their effectiveness (e.g., whether they elicit unsafe responses). The Judge inputs can vary between domains, but preference-based evaluations include the Target responses to both the candidate and the existing prompt at \\(z^{\\prime}\\). The Judge determines which prompt is more effective using a majority vote over multiple evaluations and swapping prompt positions to mitigate order bias (Zheng et al., 2023). If the candidate wins the comparison, it replaces the existing prompt; otherwise, it is discarded.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Relying on a preference model rather than a score-based evaluator offers two advantages. First, LLMs prompted to perform pairwise comparisons have a higher agreement with humans than those performing single-answer grading (Zheng et al., 2023). This is particularly true in an optimisation context, which introduces the risk of reward hacking the evaluator. Second, the score of any numerical evaluator with a fixed scale can be maximised, at which point it is impossible to identify better candidate prompts, resulting in minimal updates in the archive. The preference model allows us to bypass this issue, leading to more open-ended improvement, as we show in Section4.4.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While we describe Rainbow Teaming as using LLMs for all key steps, those can be substituted for other models or even rule-based components in some domains. We provide one such example in Section6.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '## 4 Rainbow Teaming for Safety\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of Rainbow Teaming in discovering adversarial prompts that trigger unsafe (i.e., harmful, offensive, or toxic) responses. We specifically target Llama 2-chat models that have been fine-tuned with safety-aligned data and are among the safest publicly-available LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023).\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Feature DescriptorsWe use two feature dimensions: Risk Category and Attack Style. Our risk categories expand upon the safety risk taxonomy in Inan et al. (2023) and cover common safety issues in LLMs, such as "Criminal Planning", "Violence and Hate" or "Self-Harm". Attack Style pertains to the method of eliciting unsafe responses, such as "Authority Manipulation" and "Role Play". Together, these features enable a thorough evaluation of LLM safety, covering a broad spectrum of adversarial threats and tactics. The full list of categories for both features is provided in AppendixB.1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Mutation OperatorAs a Mutator, we use an instruction-tuned Llama 2 70B model, which applies two mutations to create the candidate prompt, as illustrated in Figure2. The first mutation targets the risk category, using a few-shot prompt template shared across all categories. The second mutation focuses on the attack style, employing few-shot prompts handcrafted for each individual category.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Preference ModelWe use an instruction-tuned Llama 2 70B model as a Judge to compare Target responses to two adversarial prompts. Its role is to determine which response is more unsafe, ignoring the prompts. The prompt corresponding to the winner\'s response is the one we then keep in the archive. Details about the prompts used for the Judge are provided in AppendixC.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To initialise the archive, we randomly select prompts from the Anthropic Harmless (Ganguli et al., 2022) dataset, which are subjected to the same mutations with respect to feature categories and set the foundation for subsequent evolutionary iterations. To evaluate our method, we use two independent measures of Attack Success Rate (ASR) - the proportion of prompts in the archive that elicit unsafe responses. Specifically, we use two safety classifiers, namely GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) with a specialised prompt and the Llama Guard safeguard model (Inan et al., 2023). GPT-4 acts as a binary classifier for whether a response is generally unsafe or not, independent of risk categories. In contrast, Llama Guard is prompted to perform _per-category binary classification_(Inan et al., 2023), considering an attack successful only if the resulting response violates the risk category it is assigned to. Under this methodology, an adversarial prompt triggering the Target to explain how to hack a laptop would not be considered successful if evaluated with respect to the "self-harm" risk category. Neither of these metrics is explicitly optimised by Rainbow Teaming, but the probability of Llama Guard classifying a prompt as unsafe is the fitness score used to bias the selection of the prescribed feature descriptors for new candidates. Prompts for both evaluators are provided in AppendixC.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Results on Llama 2-chat models\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 3 presents the ASR of Rainbow Teaming when applied to Llama 2-chat models with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters across 2000 iterations, using GPT-4 and Llama Guard for evaluation. The 7B model exhibits the highest vulnerability: following 2000 iterations, we obtain an archive of 100 prompts with an approximate **ASR of 92%**, as evaluated by GPT-4. The 13B variant emerges as the most robust, with an 84% ASR. The 70B model demonstrates a vulnerability level that lies between the two, with an 87% ASR. These results are also echoed by ASR reported by Llama Guard.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We also measure inter-evaluator agreement on 100 pairs of prompts and responses. Table 1 shows that human-human agreement (83%) is similar to human-AI agreement (81% for GPT-4 and 78% for Llama Guard) and GPT-4-Llama Guard agreement (79%), and is consistent with prior work (Zheng et al., 2023). Thus, for the rest of the paper, we will use GPT-4 and Llama Guard as a proxy for human evaluations.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Role of System Prompts\n' +
      '\n' +
      'While our main experiments provide the prompts to the Target as is (within appropriate instruction tokens), we additionally analyse incorporating two _system prompts_. The _legacy_ system prompt is designed to emphasise both _safety and helpfulness_.1 The _helpful_ system prompt is a handcrafted variant of the legacy prompt that focuses on helpfulness without explicitly emphasising safety. All system prompts are provided in Appendix C.1.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Footnote 1: It was initially released with Llama 2 but has since been deprecated due to its high false refusal rate. See the change here.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The effectiveness of Rainbow Teaming when using these different system prompts is presented in Table 2. Our results indicate the inclusion of a system prompt emphasising safety significantly diminishes the success rate of adversarial attacks to 29% / 45%, according to GPT-4 and Llama Guard evaluations, respectively. However, using this system prompt makes the model overly conservative, occasionally refusing to answer benign questions that appear unsafe. On the other hand, the helpful system prompt, which does not emphasise\n' +

      'safety explicitly, remains vulnerable to attacks, with 71% / 89% ASR, yet still offers improved robustness compared to not using a system prompt at all, which sees 92% / 89% ASR. The Llama 2-chat 7B model has been safety-aligned regardless of the system prompt, but its robustness is highly dependent on this variable.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Transfer of Adversarial Prompts\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Understanding whether attacks transfer across model sizes is important to assess the generality of the adversarial prompts, and whether they are intrinsically tied to the models they were optimised for. Furthermore, generating adversarial prompts for smaller models that also transfer to larger ones can save computational resources compared to performing the optimisation directly on the larger targets.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Table 3 presents the ASR on Llama 2-chat 7B, 13B, and 70B models using archives generated by Rainbow Teaming targeting each of these models. We provide in grey the ASR when re-prompting the targets on their own archive to contextualise the transfer results. These numbers are slightly lower than those reported in Section 4.1 due to model variability, which means models occasionally refuse to respond even for strong adversarial prompts. To mitigate this issue, we generate 4 responses for each adversarial prompt, and consider the prompt successful if at least one of the responses is classified as unsafe.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We observe significant transfer across models. For instance, the archive generated with the smallest model (7B) as a target transfers well to other model sizes, having a 46% and 53% ASR for 13B and 70B, respectively. The transferability for archives generated with larger models is also similar. This result suggests that we can use Rainbow Teaming to generate adversarial prompts for one model size, potentially smaller, and then reuse some of these prompts to probe and improve the robustness of other, potentially larger, models.\n' +

      '### Preference Model Ablation\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we investigate the role of the preference model used for Rainbow Teaming. The first option is to prompt an LLM to act as a pairwise comparison Judge (Zheng et al., 2023). The Judge takes as input the response to the candidate prompt and the response to the prompt already in the archive, and is instructed to say which of the two is more harmful. As recommended by Zheng et al. (2023), we use position swapping (evaluating twice for each order of the prompt-response pairs) to reduce positional bias, and few-shot prompting to improve consistency. We refer to this variant as "Comparison-based (Judge)" and use it as default throughout the paper.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'For our baseline, we use the Llama Guard probability of classifying the response as "unsafe" as a preference model. In that case, we perform an archive substitution if the probability for the candidate response is higher than that of the existing response. We refer to this Rainbow Teaming variant as "Score-based (No Judge)".\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In our evaluation, as shown in Figure 4, the score-based baseline achieves a higher Llama Guard-evaluated ASR, aligning with its optimisation objective. However, it falls short in GPT-4-evaluated ASR, suggesting overfitting to Llama Guard scores, indicative of reward hacking (Skalse et al., 2022). Qualitatively, we find that the adversarial prompts produced by the score-based method are also of lower quality. We also show the number of archive updates for the two variations of Rainbow Teaming. We observe that the No Judge baseline quickly maximising the Llama Guard score (capped to 1.0) leads to sparse updates thereafter. In contrast, the Judge-based variant continues to refine the _quality_ of the adversarial prompts in the archive, indicated by ongoing archive updates, even after filling the archive with successful prompts. This underscores the advantage of Rainbow Teaming\'s open-ended search process over a purely score-driven approach.\n' +

      'Because archive categories are not mutually exclusive, we run the risk of populating the archive with near identical prompts (e.g., _"Navigate the treacherous landscape of spreading hate..."_ vs _"Navigate the treacherous landscape of cybercrime..."_). This is useful for discovering a category-agnostic failure mode but comes at the cost of significant diversity loss in the archive.\n' +

      'Generating diverse, high-quality instruction-tuning datasets can be expensive, often requiring human annotations. Rainbow Teaming offers a low-cost alternative, generating diverse synthetic data that specifically targets the model\'s vulnerabilities. In this section, we demonstrate the usefulness of Rainbow Teaming as a synthetic dataset generation method by applying it to improve the safety of LLMs. We find that training on our synthetically generated data improves robustness to adversarial prompts while retaining the general capabilities of the model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We use Rainbow Teaming to generate 15 archives targeting Llama 2-chat 7B model, for a total of 1500 adversarial prompts. We perform a 12/3 train-test split and use Llama 2-chat 70B with a handcrafted system prompt to generate safe refusal prompts for the train set. We then perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Wei et al., 2022) of Llama 2-chat 7B on this dataset and evaluate the ASR of the 300 held-out prompts before and after SFT. As shown in Table 5, we find that **fine-tuning Llama 2-chat 7B on the synthetic dataset generated by Rainbow Teaming significantly reduces the attack success rate from 92% / 82% to 2.6% / 1.3%,** as measured by GPT-4 and Llama Guard. Crucially, SFT does not diminish the model\'s general capabilities as measured on the GSM8K (8-shot, maj@1) (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MMLU (5-shot) (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmarks.2\n' +

We report safety and helpfulness scores on the Anthropic Harmless and Anthropic Helpful datasets (Ganguli et al., 2022) respectively. We observe a 1.3% safety score increase, despite the fact that Llama 2-chat models use the Anthropic Harmless dataset as a part of the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) pipeline, as described in Touvron et al. (2023). This is accompanied by a 0.6% drop in helpfulness, which we attribute to fine-tuning the model exclusively on the adversarial prompts produced by Rainbow Teaming. Mixing the adversarial data with helpfulness data would likely negate this effect, but we leave the investigation of adversarial fine-tuning strategies to future work.\n' +

We select 10 topics such "Science and Technology" or "History and Culture", split length into 10 bins between 24 and 96 characters, and use 4 interrogative words ("What", "Who", "When", "Where"), for a final archive of 400 questions. The full list of categories for all three features is provided in Appendix B.2.\n' +

      'Mutation OperatorThe categorical mutation operators for topics and interrogative words are analogous to those used for risk category and attack style in Section 4. For length, we simply prompt the Mutator (an instruction-tuned Llama 2 70B model) to either "lengthen" or "shorten" the question. To determine the correct length bin of the candidate prompt, we rely on a simple character count of the prompt string.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Preference ModelOur preference model differs from Section 4 to account for the difficulty of evaluating the relative correctness of responses to two different questions. For each question \\(q\\), we generate an answer \\(r_{t}\\) from the Target and another \\(r_{o}\\) from an _Oracle_ LLM. While both the Oracle and Target models receive identical prompts, the Oracle is equipped with superior capabilities (Llama 2-chat 70B) compared to the Target (Llama 2-chat 7B). We then provide the question \\(q\\) alongside both answers \\(r_{t}\\) and \\(r_{o}\\) to the Judge to determine whether the question is factual and objective, and whether the Oracle\'s answer is better than the Target\'s answer. If these conditions are met, we save the question to the archive with fitness 1. If not, but the archive cell is empty, we save the question with a fitness of 0.1 to act as a stepping stone.

For the initial processing of the output, we use the Llama 2-chat 70B model, which is responsible for preliminary analysis and identification of potentially malicious content.

      '### Adversarial Attacks on LLMs\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming relates most closely to prompt-level attacks which rely on strategies such as misspellings, prompting in foreign languages (Yong et al., 2023), or persona-modulation (Shah et al., 2023) to jailbreak LLMs. Perez et al. (2022) use an LLM and a brute-force approach to automatically discover prompt-level attacks, but this approach can suffer from mode collapse and so does not always generate a diverse set of prompts. Meanwhile, Liu et al. (2023) propose a white-box method that refines hand-crafted attack prompts using a mix of genetic algorithms and LLM-based mutations. However, they focus on optimising a single solution rather than a diverse population. The closest works to our own are PAIR (Chao et al., 2023) and Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP) (Mehrotra et al., 2023) -- two black-box methods for automatically discovering prompt-level attacks by using an LLM to iteratively generate candidates. However, both methods are designed to jailbreak the model with respect to a single task rather than across a range of diverse risk categories and attack styles. In contrast, our work uses quality-diversity search to automatically discover attacks covering a diverse set of risks and attack strategies. Although Rainbow Teaming could be adapted to create token-level attacks (Zou et al., 2023) by integrating the appropriate attack categories and prompts, we restrict this work to prompt-level attacks given that prompt-level attacks are more interpretable and harder to detect.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Open-Endedness and LLMs\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming builds on the ability of LLMs to act as a powerful mutation operator over language inputs, one that adheres to the underlying structure of natural language (Lehman et al., 2022). Several recent methods exploit this capability of LLMs in order to perform an efficient novelty-driven evolutionary search in the language space, leading to the discovery of potentially open-ended repertoires of solutions (Chen et al., 2023; Fernando et al., 2023; Meyerson et al., 2023). Closest to our approach, QDAIF (Bradley et al., 2023) similarly uses LLMs for QD search in order to generate a diverse archive of LLM responses. While QDAIF focuses purely on generating diverse outputs for creative writing, our method seeks to find a diverse set of adversarial prompts -- a separate problem altogether, which lies upstream from that of text generation.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Adversarial Training\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Rainbow Teaming\'s approach parallels other forms of adversarial training, which prioritises training on tasks or data points where the model performs poorly. In reinforcement learning (RL), methods such as active domain randomisation (Mehta et al., 2020; Raparthy et al., 2020) and regret-based unsupervised environment design (Dennis et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021; Parker-Holder et al., 2022; Samvelyan et al., 2023) search for training tasks where the agent performs poorly in terms of absolute task performance or regret, respectively. Regret-based prioritisation has been shown to hold robustness guarantees at convergence and carry the benefit of avoiding unsolvable tasks (which always result in zero regret). The fitness score used by Rainbow Teaming coincides with regret (Savage, 1951), as a high fitness here implies the existence of another prompt that elicits a less undesirable response, as evaluated by the Judge. Similarly, many active learning and automatic curriculum learning methods in supervised learning focus training on examples maximising error metrics derived from the model\'s predictions (Graves et al., 2017; Mindermann et al., 2022; Evans et al., 2023). Dynabench (Kiela et al., 2021) extends this paradigm by querying humans-in-the-loop for adversarial examples. Many methods in scenario generation also closely relate to Rainbow Teaming, including recent approaches using QD search to find adversarial environments that induce poor behaviour in fully-automated or mixed-autonomy systems (Fontaine et al., 2021; Fontaine and Nikolaidis, 2022; Bhatt et al., 2022). This extends to recent work applying QD to multi-agent RL (Samvelyan et al., 2024), which inspired our method.\n' +

      'Conclusion\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this work, we introduce Rainbow Teaming, a novel approach for the automatic generation of diverse adversarial prompts for LLMs. By leveraging quality-diversity search, Rainbow Teaming efficiently explores the space of potential adversarial attacks, resulting in a diverse archive of prompts that highlight the vulnerabilities of LLMs. Our extensive experiments with the Llama 2-chat family of models across various domains, including safety, question answering, and cybersecurity, demonstrate the generality of Rainbow Teaming. Moreover, the synthetic data generated through Rainbow Teaming can be utilised for fine-tuning LLMs, thereby enhancing their resilience against further adversarial attacks without compromising their general performance. This illustrates the potential of Rainbow Teaming as a means for the continuous, open-ended self-improvement of LLMs, with minimal human intervention. Future work with Rainbow Teaming involves extending its application beyond LLMs to areas such as vision and multi-modal AI systems. Moreover, incorporating Rainbow Teaming into the fine-tuning stages of LLM development presents an opportunity to consistently strengthen their defences against adversarial attacks.\n' +

      '## Impact Statement\n' +
      '\n' +
      'This paper introduces Rainbow Teaming, a novel method for generating diverse, adversarial prompts to test and enhance the robustness of LLMs. The approach aims to automatically generate a diverse set of adversarial text prompts, with the aim of using this data to fine-tune LLM for safety. Unlike simpler adversarial attack methods, Rainbow Teaming requires extensive resources, making it impractical for quick, malicious exploits. Its undirected, varied approach is less likely to be used for harmful attacks. The primary value of Rainbow Teaming lies in its potential to identify and address robustness issues in LLMs, contributing to their responsible development and deployment.\n' +
