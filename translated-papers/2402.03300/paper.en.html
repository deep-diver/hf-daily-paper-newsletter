      'Mathematical reasoning poses a significant challenge for language models due to its complex and structured nature. In this paper, we introduce DeepSeekMath 7B, which continues pre-training DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B with 120B math-related tokens sourced from Common Crawl, together with natural language and code data. DeepSeekMath 7B has achieved an impressive score of 51.7% on the competition-level MATH benchmark without relying on external toolkits and voting techniques, approaching the performance level of Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4. Self-consistency over 64 samples from DeepSeekMath 7B achieves 60.9% on MATH. The mathematical reasoning capability of DeepSeekMath is attributed to two key factors: First, we harness the significant potential of publicly available web data through a meticulously engineered data selection pipeline. Second, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), that enhances mathematical reasoning abilities while concurrently optimizing the memory usage of PPO.\n' +

      '## 1 Introduction\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Large language models (LLM) have revolutionized the approach to mathematical reasoning in artificial intelligence, spurring significant advancements in both the quantitative reasoning benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and the geometry reasoning benchmark (Trinh et al., 2024). Moreover, these models have proven instrumental in assisting humans in solving complex mathematical problems (Tao, 2023). However, cutting-edge models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Gemini-Ultra (Anil et al., 2023) are not publicly available, and the currently accessible open-source models considerably trail behind in performance.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this study, we introduce DeepSeekMath, a domain-specific language model that significantly outperforms the mathematical capabilities of open-source models and approaches the performance level of GPT-4 on academic benchmarks. To achieve this, we create the DeepSeekMath Corpus, a large-scale high-quality pre-training corpus comprising 120B math tokens. This dataset is extracted from the Common Crawl (CC) using a fastText-based classifier (Joulin et al., 2016). In the initial iteration, the classifier is trained using instances from OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023) as positive examples, while incorporating a diverse selection of other web pages to serve as negative examples. Subsequently, we employ the classifier to mine additional positive instances from the CC, which are further refined through human annotation. The classifier is then updated with this enhanced dataset to improve its performance. The evaluation results indicate that the large-scale corpus is of high quality, as our base model DeepSeekMath-Base 7B achieves 64.2% on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and 36.2% on the competition-level MATH dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), outperforming Minerva 540B (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a). In addition, the DeepSeekMath Corpus is multilingual, so we notice an improvement in Chinese mathematical benchmarks (Wei et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023). We believe that our experience in mathematical data processing is a starting point for the research community, and there is significant room for improvement in the future.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'DeepSeekMath-Base is initialized with DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B (Guo et al., 2024), as we notice that starting from a code training model is a better choice compared to a general LLM. Furthermore, we observe the math training also improves model capability on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BBH benchmarks (Suzgun et al., 2022), indicating it does not only enhance the model\'s mathematical abilities but also amplifies general reasoning capabilities.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'After pre-training, we apply mathematical instruction tuning to DeepSeekMath-Base with chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022), program-of-thought (Chen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023), and tool-integrated reasoning (Gou et al., 2023) data. The resulting model DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B beats all 7B counterparts and is comparable with 70B open-source instruction-tuned models.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Furthermore, we introduce the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017). GRPO foregoes the critic model, instead estimating the baseline from group scores, significantly reducing training resources. By solely using a subset of English instruction tuning data, GRPO obtains a substantial improvement over the strong DeepSeekMath-Instruct, including both in-domain (GSM8K: 82.9% \\(\\rightarrow\\) 88.2%, MATH: 46.8% \\(\\rightarrow\\) 51.7%) and out-of-domain mathematical tasks (e.g., CMATH: 84.6% \\(\\rightarrow\\) 88.8%) during the reinforcement learning phase. We also provide a unified paradigm to understand different methods, such as Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) (Yuan et al., 2023a), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023), PPO and GRPO. Based on such a unified paradigm, we find that all these methods are conceptualized as either direct or simplified RL techniques. We also conduct extensive experiments, e.g., online v.s. offline training, outcome v.s. process supervision, single-turn v.s. iterative RL and so on,to deeply investigate the essential elements of this paradigm. At last, we explain why our RL boosts the performance of instruction-tuned models, and further summarize potential directions to achieve more effective RL based on this unified paradigm.\n' +

      '**Math Pre-Training at Scale**\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* Our research provides compelling evidence that the publicly accessible Common Crawl data contains valuable information for mathematical purposes. By implementing a meticulously designed data selection pipeline, we successfully construct the DeepSeekMath Corpus, a high-quality dataset of 120B tokens from web pages filtered for mathematical content, which is almost 7 times the size of the math web pages used by Minerva (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a) and 9 times the size of the recently released OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023).\n' +
      '* Our pre-trained base model DeepSeekMath-Base 7B achieves comparable performance with Minerva 540B (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a), indicating the number of parameters is not the only key factor in mathematical reasoning capability. A smaller model pre-trained on high-quality data could achieve strong performance as well.\n' +
      '* We share our findings from math training experiments. Code training prior to math training improves models\' ability to solve mathematical problems both with and without tool use. This offers a partial answer to the long-standing question: _does code training improve reasoning abilities_? We believe it does, at least for mathematical reasoning.\n' +
      '* Although training on arXiv papers is common, especially in many math-related papers, it brings no notable improvements on all mathematical benchmarks adopted in this paper.\n' +

      '### Summary of Evaluations and Metrics\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **English and Chinese Mathematical Reasoning**: We conduct comprehensive assessments of our models on English and Chinese benchmarks, covering mathematical problemsfrom grade-school level to college level. English benchmarks include GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021), SAT (Azerbayev et al., 2023), OCW Courses (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a), MMLU-STEM (Hendrycks et al., 2020). Chinese benchmarks include MSSM-zh (Shi et al., 2023), CMATH (Wei et al., 2023), Gaokao-MathCloze (Zhong et al., 2023), and Gaokao-MathQA (Zhong et al., 2023). We evaluate models\' ability to generate self-contained text solutions without tool use, and also the ability to solve problems using Python.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'On English benchmarks, DeepSeeKMath-Base is competitive with the closed-source Minerva 540B (Lewkowycz et al., 2022a), and surpasses all open-source base models (e.g., Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) and Llemma-34B (Azerbayev et al., 2023)), regardless of whether they\'ve undergone math pre-training or not, often by a significant margin. Notably, DeepSeeKMath-Base is superior on Chinese benchmarks, likely because we don\'t follow previous works (Azerbayev et al., 2023; Lewkowycz et al., 2022a) to collect English-only math pre-training data, and also include high-quality non-English ones. With mathematical instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, the resulting DeepSeeKMath-Instruct and DeepSeeKMath-RL demonstrate strong performance, obtaining an accuracy of over 50% on the competition-level MATH dataset for the first time within the open-source community.\n' +
      '* **Formal Mathematics**: We evaluate DeepSeeKMath-Base using the informal-to-formal theorem proving task from (Jiang et al., 2022) on miniF2F (Zheng et al., 2021) with Isabelle (Wenzel et al., 2008) chosen to be the proof assistant. DeepSeeKMath-Base demonstrates strong few-shot autoformalization performance.\n' +
      '* **Natural Language Understanding, Reasoning, and Code**: To build a comprehensive profile of models\' general understanding, reasoning, and coding capabilities, we evaluate DeepSeeKMath-Base on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2020) which encompasses 57 multiple-choice tasks covering diverse subjects, BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022) which consists of 23 challenging tasks that mostly require multi-step reasoning to solve, as well as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) which are widely used to evaluate code language models. Math pre-training benefits both language understanding and reasoning performance.\n' +

      '## 2 Math Pre-Training\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Data Collection and Decontamination\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we will outline the process of constructing the DeepSeeKMath Corpus from Common Crawl. As depicted in Figure 2, we present an iterative pipeline that demonstrates how to systematically gather a large-scale mathematical corpus from Common Crawl, starting with a seed corpus (e.g., a small but high-quality collection of math-related dataset). It\'s worth noting that this approach is also applicable to other domains, such as coding.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'First, we choose OpenWebMath (Paster et al., 2023), a collection of high-quality mathematical web texts, as our initial seed corpus. Using this corpus, we train a fastText model (Joulin et al., 2016) to recall more OpenWebMath-like mathematical web pages. Specifically, we randomly select 500,000 data points from the seed corpus as positive training examples and another 500,000 web pages from Common Crawl as negative ones. We employ an open-source library1 for training, configuring the vector dimension to 256, learning rate to 0.1, the maximum length of word n-gram to 3, the minimum number of word occurrences to 3, and the number of training epochs to 3. To reduce the size of the original Common Crawl, we employ URL-based deduplication and near-deduplication techniques, resulting in 40B HTML web pages. We then recall mathematical web pages from deduplicated Common Crawl with the fastText model. To filter out low-quality mathematical content, we rank the collected pages according to their scores predicted by the fastText model, and only preserve the top-ranking ones. The volume of data preserved is assessed through pre-training experiments on the top 40B, 80B, 120B, and 160B tokens. In the first iteration, we choose to keep the top 40B tokens.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'After the first iteration of data collection, numerous mathematical web pages remain uncollected, mainly because the fastText model is trained on a set of positive examples that lacks sufficient diversity. We therefore identify additional mathematical web sources to enrich the seed corpus, so that we can optimize the fastText model. Specifically, we first organize the entire Common Crawl into disjoint domains; a domain is defined as web pages sharing the same base URL. For each domain, we calculate the percentage of web pages that are collected in the first iteration. Domains where over 10% of the web pages have been collected are classified as math-related (e.g., mathoverflow.net). Subsequently, we manually annotate the URLs associated with mathematical content within these identified domains (e.g., mathoverflow.net/questions). Web pages linked to these URLs, yet uncollected, will be added to the seed corpus. This approach enables us to gather more positive examples, thereby training an improved fastText model capable of recalling more mathematical data in the subsequent iteration. After four iterations of data collection, we end up with 35.5M mathematical web pages, totaling 120B tokens. In the fourth iteration, we notice that nearly 98% of the data has already been collected in the third iteration, so we decide to cease data collection.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'To avoid benchmark contamination, we follow Guo et al. (2024) to filter out web pages containing questions or answers from English mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and Chinese benchmarks such as CMATH (Wei et al., 2023) and AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023). The filtering criteria are as follows: any text segment containing a 10-gram string that matches exactly with any sub-string from the evaluation benchmarks is removed from our math training corpus. For benchmark texts that are shorter than 10 grams but have at least 3 grams, we employ exact matching to filter out contaminated web pages.\n' +

      '#### 2.2.1 Training Setting\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We apply math training to a general pre-trained language model with 1.3B parameters, which shares the same framework as the DeepSeek LLMs (DeepSeek-AI, 2024), denoted as DeepSeekLLM 1.3B. We separately train a model on each mathematical corpus for 150B tokens. All experiments are conducted using the efficient and light-weight HAI-LLM (High-flyer, 2023) training framework. Following the training practice of DeepSeek LLMs, we use the AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with \\(\\beta_{1}=0.9\\), \\(\\beta_{2}=0.95\\), and weight_decay = 0.1, along with a multi-step learning rate schedule where the learning rate reaches the peak after 2,000 warmup steps, decreases to its 31.6% after 80% of the training process, and further decreases to 10.0% of the peak after 90% of the training process. We set the maximum value of learning rate to 5.3e-4, and use a batch size of 4M tokens with a 4K context length.\n' +

      'As the value function employed in PPO is typically another model of comparable size as the policy model, it brings a substantial memory and computational burden. Additionally, during RL training, the value function is treated as a baseline in the calculation of the advantage for variance reduction. While in the LLM context, usually only the last token is assigned a reward score by the reward model, which may complicate the training of a value function that is accurate at each token. To address this, as shown in Figure 4, we propose Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which obviates the need for additional value function approximation as in PPO, and instead uses the average reward of multiple sampled outputs, produced in response to the same question, as the baseline. More specifically, for each question \\(q\\), GRPO samples a group of outputs \\(\\{o_{1},o_{2},\\cdots,o_{G}\\}\\) from the old policy \\(\\pi_{o_{old}}\\) and then optimizes the policy model by maximizing the following objective:\n' +

The group relative way that GRPO leverages to calculate the advantages, aligns well with the comparative nature of rewards models, as reward models are typically trained on datasets of comparisons between outputs on the same question. Also note that, instead of adding KL penalty in the reward, GRPO regularizes by directly adding the KL divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy to the loss, avoiding complicating the calculation of \\(\\hat{A}_{i,t}\\). And different from the KL penalty term used in (2), we estimate the KL divergence with the following unbiased estimator (Schulman, 2020):\n' +

      'Formally, for each question \\(q\\), a group of outputs \\(\\{o_{1},o_{2},\\cdots,o_{G}\\}\\) are sampled from the old policy model \\(\\pi_{o_{old}}\\). A reward model is then used to score the outputs, yielding \\(G\\) rewards \\(\\mathbf{r}=\\{r_{1},r_{2},\\cdots,r_{G}\\}\\) correspondingly. Subsequently, these rewards are normalized by subtracting the group average and dividing by the group standard deviation. Outcome supervision provides the normalized reward at the end of each output \\(o_{i}\\) and sets the advantages \\(\\hat{A}_{i,t}\\) of all tokens in the output as the normalized reward, i.e., \\(\\hat{A}_{i,t}=\\widetilde{r}_{i}=\\frac{r_{i}-\\text{mean}(\\mathbf{r})}{\\text{ std}(\\mathbf{r})}\\), and then optimizes the policy by maximizing the objective defined in equation (3).\n' +

Formally, given the question \\(q\\) and \\(G\\) sampled outputs \\(\\{o_{1},o_{2},\\cdots,o_{G}\\}\\), a process reward model is used to score each step of the outputs, yielding corresponding rewards: \\(\\mathbf{R}=\\{r_{1}^{index(1)},\\cdots,r_{1}^{index(K_{1})}\\},\\cdots,\\{r_{G}^{ index(1)},\\cdots,r_{G}^{index(K_{G})}\\}\\), where \\(index(j)\\) is the end token index of the \\(j\\)-th step, and \\(K_{i}\\) is the total number of steps in the \\(i\\)-th output.

Subsequently, the process supervision calculates the advantage of each token as the sum of the normalized rewards from the following steps, i.e., \\(\\hat{A}_{i,t}=\\sum_{index(j)\\geq t}\\widetilde{r}_{i}^{index(j)}\\), and then optimizes the policy by maximizing the objective defined in equation (3).\n' +

We train our initial reward model based on the DeepSeekMath-Base 7B with a learning rate of 2e-5. For GRPO, we set the learning rate of the policy model as 1e-6. The KL coefficient is 0.04. For each question, we sample 64 outputs. The max length is set to 1024, and the training batch size is 1024. The policy model only has a single update following each exploration stage. We evaluate DeepSeekMath-RL 7B on benchmarks following DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B.

      '#### 5.2.1 Towards to a Unified Paradigm\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this section, we provide a unified paradigm to analyze different training methods, such as SFT, RFT, DPO, PPO, GRPO, and further conduct experiments to explore the factors of the unified paradigm. Generally, the gradient with respect to the parameter \\(\\theta\\) of a training method can be written as:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '\\[\\nabla_{\\theta}\\mathcal{J}_{\\mathcal{A}}(\\theta)=\\mathbb{E}[\\underbrace{(q,o) \\sim\\mathcal{D}}_{\\text{Data Source}}]\\left(\\frac{1}{|o|}\\sum_{t=1}^{|o|} \\underbrace{GC_{\\mathcal{A}}(q,o,t,\\pi_{rf})}_{Gradient Coefficient}\\nabla_{\\theta} \\log\\pi_{\\theta}(o_{t}|q,o_{<t})\\right). \\tag{5}\\]\n' +
      '\n' +
      'There exist three key components: 1) _Data Source_\\(\\mathcal{D}\\), which determines the training data; 2) _Reward Function_\\(\\pi_{rf}\\), which is the source of the training reward signal; 3) _Algorithm_\\(\\mathcal{A}\\): which processes the training data and the reward signal to the gradient coefficient \\(GC\\) that determines the magnitude of the penalty or reinforcement for the data. We analyze several representative methods based on such a unified paradigm:\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)**: SFT fine-tunes pretrained model on human selected SFT data.\n' +
      '* **Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning (RFT)**: RFT further fine-tunes the SFT model on the filtered outputs sampled from the SFT model based on SFT questions. RFT filters the outputs based on the correctness of their answers.\n' +
      '* **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: DPO further refines the SFT model by fine-tuning it on augmented outputs sampled from the SFT model, using pair-wise DPO loss.\n' +
      '* **Online Rejection Sampling Fine-tuning (Online RFT)**: Different from RFT, Online RFT initiates the policy model using the SFT model and refines it by fine-tuning with the augmented outputs sampled from the real-time policy model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '* **PPO/GRPO**: PPO/GRPO initializes the policy model using the SFT model and reinforces it with the outputs sampled from the real-time policy model.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We summarize the components of these methods in Table 10. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for a more detailed derivation process.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Observation about Data SourceWe divide the data source into two categories, online sampling, and offline sampling. Online sampling denotes that the training data is from the exploration results of the real-time training policy model, while offline sampling denotes that the training data is from the sampling results of the initial SFT model. RFT and DPO follow the offline style, while Online RFT and GRPO follow the online style.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As shown in Figure 5, we find that the Online RFT significantly outperforms RFT on two benchmarks. Specifically, Online RFT is comparable to RFT in the early stage of training but gains an absolute advantage in the later stage, demonstrating the superiority of online training. This is intuitive, as in the initial stage, the actor and the SFT model exhibit close resemblance, with the sampled data revealing only minor differences. In the later stage, however, the data sampled from the actor will exhibit more significant differences, and real-time data sampling\n' +

      '\n' +
      'Observation about Gradient CoefficientThe algorithm processes the reward signal to the gradient coefficient to update the model parameter. We divide the reward function as \'Rule\' and \'Model\' in our experiments. Rule refers to judging the quality of a response based on the correctness of the answer, and Model denotes that we train a reward model to score each response. The training data of the reward model is based on the rule judgment. Equations 10 and 21 highlight a key difference between GRPO and Online RFT: GRPO uniquely adjusts its gradient coefficient based on the reward value provided by the reward model. This allows for differential reinforcement and penalization of responses according to their varying magnitudes. In contrast, Online RFT lacks this feature; it does not penalize incorrect responses and uniformly reinforces all responses with correct answers at the same level of intensity.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'As demonstrated in Figure 5, GRPO surpasses online RFT, thereby highlighting the efficiency of altering positive and negative gradient coefficients. In addition, GRPO+PS shows superior performance compared to GRPO+OS, indicating the benefits of using fine-grained, step-aware gradient coefficients. Furthermore, we explore the iterative RL, in our experiments, we conduct two rounds of iteration. As shown in Figure 6, we notice that the iterative RL significantly improves the performance, especially at the first iteration.\n' +

      '#### 5.2.2 Why RL Works?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'In this paper, we conduct reinforcement learning based on a subset of instruction tuning data, and it achieves significant performance enhancement upon the instruction tuning model. To further explain why reinforcement learning works. We evaluate the Pass@K and Maj@K accuracy of the Instruct and RL models on two benchmarks. As shown in Figure 7, RL enhances Maj@K\'s performance but not Pass@K. These findings indicate that RL enhances the model\'s overall performance by rendering the output distribution more robust, in other words, **it seems that the improvement is attributed to boosting the correct response from TopK rather than the enhancement of fundamental capabilities.** Similarly, (Wang et al., 2023a) identified a misalignment problem in reasoning tasks within the SFT model, showing that the reasoning\n' +

      '\n' +

      '\n' +
      '#### 5.2.3 How to Achieve More Effective RL?\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We demonstrate RL works pretty well in mathematical reasoning tasks. We also provide a unified paradigm to understand different representative training methods. Within this paradigm, all methods are conceptualized as either direct or simplified RL techniques. As summarized in Equation 5, there exist three key components: Data Source, Algorithm, and Reward Function. We provide some potential future directions about the three components.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Data SourceData source is the raw material of all training methods. In the context of RL, we specifically refer to the data source as the unlabeled questions with the outputs sampled from the policy model. In this paper, we only use the questions from the instruction tuning stage and a naive nucleus sampling to sample outputs. We think this is a potential reason that our RL pipeline only improves the Maj@K performance. In the future, we will explore our RL pipeline on out-of-distribution question prompts, in conjunction with **advanced sampling (decoding) strategies**, like those based on tree-search methods (Yao et al., 2023). Also, the **efficient inference techniques**(Kwon et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Xia et al., 2023, 2024), which determines the exploration efficiency of policy models, also play an exceedingly important role.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'AlgorithmsAlgorithms process the data and reward signal to the gradient coefficient to update the model parameter. Based on Equation 5, to some extent, all methods now fully **TRUST** the signal of the reward function to increase or decrease the conditional probability of a certain token. However, it is impossible to ensure the reward signal is always reliable, especially in extremely complex tasks. For example, even the PRM800K datasets (Lightman et al., 2023), which have been carefully annotated by well-trained annotators, still contain approximately 20% of incorrectly annotations7. To this end, we will explore the reinforcement learning algorithm\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Figure 7: The Maj@K and Pass@K of SFT and RL DeepSeeKMath 7B on GSM8K and MATH (temperature 0.7). It was noted that RL enhances Maj@K but not Pass@K.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'that is robust against noisy reward signals. We believe such **WEAK-TO-STRONG**(Burns et al., 2023) alignment methods will bring a fundamental change to the learning algorithms.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Reward FunctionReward function is the source of the training signal. In RL, the reward function is usually the neural reward model. We think there exist three important directions for reward models: 1) **How to enhance the generalization ability of the reward model.** The reward model must be effectively generalized to handle out-of-distribution questions and advanced decoding outputs; otherwise, reinforcement learning may merely stabilize the distribution of LLMs rather than improve their fundamental capabilities; 2) **How to reflect the uncertainty of reward model.** The uncertainty could potentially act as a linking bridge between the weak reward model and the weak-to-strong learning algorithms; 3) **How to efficiently build high-quality process reward models** that can provide fine-grained training signals for the reasoning process (Lightman et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b).\n' +

      '## 6 Conclusion, Limitation, and Future Work\n' +
      '\n' +
      'We present DeepSeekMath, which outperforms all open-source models on the competition-level MATH benchmark and approaches the performance of closed models. DeepSeekMath is initialized with DeepSeek-Coder-v1.5 7B and undergoes continual training for 500B tokens, with a significant component of the training data being 120B math tokens sourced from Common Crawl. Our extensive ablation study shows web pages offer significant potential for high-quality mathematical data, while arXiv may not as beneficial as we expected. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which can notably improve mathematical reasoning capabilities with less memory consumption. The experiment results show that GRPO is effective even if DeepSeekMath-Instruct 7B has reached a high score on benchmarks. We also provide a unified paradigm to understand a series of methods and summarize several potential directions for more effective reinforcement learning.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Although DeepSeekMath achieves impressive scores on quantitative reasoning benchmarks, its capability on geometry and theorem-proof are relatively weaker than closed models. For instance, in our dry run, the model cannot handle problems related to triangles and ellipses, which may indicate data selection bias in pre-training and fine-tuning. In addition, restricted by the model scale, DeepSeekMath is worse than GPT-4 on few-shot capability. GPT-4 could improve its performance with few-shot inputs, while DeepSeekMath shows similar performance in zero-shot and few-shot evaluation. In the future, we will further improve our engineered data selection pipeline to construct more high-quality pre-trained corpus. In addition, we will explore the potential directions (Section 5.2.3) for more effective reinforcement learning of LLMs.\n' +
