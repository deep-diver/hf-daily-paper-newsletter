Lastly, the discovered reasoning structure is intrinsic to the task, and conveys LLMs\' insights about the task in a more _interpretable_ way than the optimized prompts (Zhou et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023).\n' +

      'We test Self-Discover on 25 challenging reasoning tasks including Big Bench-Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2022), Thinking for Doing (T4D) (Zhou et al., 2023) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Self-Discover outperforms CoT on 21/25 task with performance gains up to 42% (Figure 1), highlighting the advantage of the self-discovered reasoning structure composed from the atomic reasoning modules against a single a priori CoT module. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Self-Discover achieves superior performance against inference-heavy methods such as CoT + Self-Consistency and majority voting of every module while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute (Figure 5). Finally, we compare Self-Discover with prompts optimized (OPRO) using a training set (Yang et al., 2023) (Figure 9). We find that Self-Discover still performs on par or better than OPRO while the self-discovered reasoning structure are much more interpretable.\n' +

      'We conduct a set of analysis to understand the effectiveness of Self-Discover. By breaking down BBH tasks into 4 different categories, we find that Self-Discover performs best on tasks requiring world knowledge and has a moderate performance boost on algorithmic tasks compared to CoT (Figure 4). This is further confirmed by the error analysis on MATH, where 74.7% model failures comes from computation errors (e.g. math). We also take a closer look at the self-discovered reasoning structures, and show the universality of them by transferability study from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama-2-70B. We hope to encourage more future work on structured reasoning for solving challenging problems using LLMs.\n' +

      'We take inspiration from how humans use prior knowledge and skills to devise a reasoning program to solve problems (Newell et al., 1958; Rasmussen, 1983). When we face a new problem, we often first search internally what knowledge and skills from our prior experience might be helpful to solve it. Then we will attempt to apply relevant knowledge and skills to this task. And finally we will connect multiple individual skills and knowledge to solve the problem. We design Self-Discover to enact these steps into two stages as illustrated in Figure 2.\n' +

      'Given a task and a set of reasoning module descriptions representing high-level problem-solving heuristics such as "_Use critical thinking_" and "_Let\'s think step by step_", Stage 1 of Self-Discover aims to uncover the intrinsic reasoning structure for solving this task via meta-reasoning. Specifically, we uses three meta-prompts to guide LLMs to select, adapt, and implement an actionable reasoning structure with no labels or training required. We format the structure in key-value pairs similar to JSON due to interpretability and findings on following JSON boosts reasoning and generation quality (Zhou et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023a).

Full BBH results are in Appendix C Table 3.\n' +

Then, in Stage 2, we can simply use the discovered reasoning structure to solve every _instance_ of the given task by instructing models to follow the provided structure by filling each key and arrive at a final answer.\n' +
      '\n' +
      '### Stage 1: Self-Discover Task-Specific Structures\n' +
      '\n' +
      'The first stage consists of three actions: 1) SELECT, where relevant reasoning modules for task-solving are chosen from the set of reasoning module descriptions; 2) ADAPT, where descriptions of selected reasoning modules are rephrased to be more specific to the task at hand; and 3) IMPLEMENT, where the adapted reasoning descriptions are implemented into a structured actionable plan so that the task can be solved by following the structure.\n' +
      '\n' +
      'SelectFirst, not every reasoning module is helpful for every task, so the first stage of Self-Discover guides model to select modules that are useful based on task examples. For example, "_reflective thinking_" might help search for first-principle theories on science problems, while "_creative thinking_" helps on generating a novel continuation to a story. Given raw set of reasoning module descriptions \\(D\\) such as "_critical thinking_", and "_break the problem into sub-problems_" (full set in Appendix A), and a few task examples without labels \\(t_{i}\\in T\\), Self-Discover first selects a subset of reasoning modules \\(D_{S}\\) that are useful for solving the tasks by using a model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) and a meta-prompt \\(p_{S}\\):\n' +

      '\n' +
      'AdaptSince each reasoning module provides a general description of how to solve problems, the next step of Self-Discover aims at _tailoring_ each selected module to the task at hand. For example, from "_break the problem into sub-problems_" to "_calculate each arithmetic operation in order_" for arithmetic problems. Given selected reasoning module subset \\(D_{S}\\) from the previous step, ADAPT rephrases _each_ of the selected module to be more specific to the task. Similarly to SELECT, this stage uses a meta-prompt \\(p_{A}\\) and a generative model \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) to generate the adapted reasoning module descriptions \\(D_{A}\\):\n' +

In addition to a meta prompt \\(p_{I}\\), IMPLEMENT also provides a demonstration of a human-written reasoning structure \\(S_{human}\\) on another task to better convert the natural language descriptions into a reasoning structure:\n' +

BBH tasks cover a diverse range of reasoning problems spanning the following 4 categories according to their authors: 1) Algorithmic and Multi-Step Arithmetic Reasoning, 2) Natural Language Understanding, 3) Use of World Knowledge, and 4) Multilingual Knowledge and Reasoning. We also test on a grounded social agent reasoning task called Thinking for Doing (T4D) where models must leverage mental state reasoning to determine actions to perform (Zhou et al., 2023), where GPT-4 with CoT only reaches around 50%. Finally, we subsample 200 examples from the MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) test set, and generate instance-level reasoning structures via a one-shot demonstration to adapt to the complexity of MATH tasks. For evaluations, we use accuracy to measure the model performance on BBH, T4D and MATH (details can be found in Appendix B).\n' +

Self-Discover achieves 69% and 85% accuracy on PaLM 2-L and GPT-4, significantly outperforming previous SoTA prompting method such as Foresee and Reflect (FaR) which employs an expert-designed reasoning structure. In contrast, Self-Discover generates the reasoning structure automatically from a set of atomic reasoning modules without human interventions.\n' +

      'For MATH, we observe a moderate gain of 1%-7% (2%-3%) on PaLM 2-L (GPT-4) from Self-Discover compared to the baselines. Upon error analysis (see Appendix D for details), we find that the reasoning structures generated by PaLM 2-L from Self-Discover are correct 87.5% of the time: human experts can follow the reasoning structures to solve the tasks perfectly.

      'Recent advancements in the area of LLMs have given rise to a plethora of few-shot (Brown et al., 2020) and instruction (Mishra et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022) prompting techniques, including _Chain-of-Thought_ prompting (CoT) (Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022), Least-to-most prompting (Zhou et al., 2022; Drozdov et al., 2022), Decomposed prompting (Khot et al., 2022), Reframing (Mishra et al., 2022), Help Me Think Prompting (Mishra and Nouri, 2023), Stepback Prompting (Zheng et al., 2023) and search-based approaches like _Tree-of-Thought (ToT)_(Yao et al., 2023), Graph-of-Thought (Besta et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023), Branch-solve-merge (Saha et al., 2023) and RAP (Hao et al., 2023). Each of the prompting methods has some strengths and weaknesses in terms of their successful application domain. Our work Self-Discover presents the missing piece in the prompting literature, as Self-Discover provides a way to self-compose over various prompting methods via the proposed self-discovery mechanism. Composing over prompting methods in Self-Discover is analogous to the programming literature where a program is written using various basic building blocks such as for loop, if/else condition etc.\n' +

      '\n' +
      'With the development of various reasoning and planning benchmarks such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), Math (Hendrycks et al.), BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2023) etc., various methods have been proposed to improve model performance. Often these methods induce specific reasoning structures mimicking the reasoning structure of the underlying task associated with the dataset. For example, chain of thought (Wei et al., 2022) and scratchpad (Nye et al., 2021) induce generation of explanations associated with a reasoning question. Similarly other methods induces specific reasoning structures such as question summarization (Kuznia et al., 2022), question decomposition (Patel et al., 2022), program generation (Mishra et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2023), etc. However, in a real world user traffic, queries can be diverse covering various reasoning structures. Our work Self-Discover allows models to combine multiple reasoning approaches by self-composing into a structure without the need to access task labels. There have been some related work that explores LLM combining skills in-context such as SkiC (Chen et al., 2023), devising a strategy (Gao et al., 2023), and planning with iterative quering (Liu et al., 2023). However, they require human annotating skills and reasoning plans while Self-Discover leverages a scalable solution with the help of LLM\'s meta-task reasoning capabilities.\n' +

During evaluation, we manually examine each task\'s outputs from LLMs and design heuristics to extract the final answers. For MATH dataset, we find that it is challenging to extract the answers accurately. As a result, we subsample 200 test examples from MATH, and manually sanity check and annotate the extracted answers for all methods tested in our paper.\n' +
