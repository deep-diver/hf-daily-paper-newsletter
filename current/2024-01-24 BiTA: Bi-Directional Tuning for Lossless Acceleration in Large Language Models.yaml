summary: This paper introduces BiTA, a method that speeds up large language models used for inference by using semi-autoregressive generation and draft verification. It works by adding a lightweight module that allows the models to generate and verify drafts in parallel, without requiring additional models or adding significant memory costs. The method significantly speeds up inference for large language models and outperforms other techniques for acceleration....
