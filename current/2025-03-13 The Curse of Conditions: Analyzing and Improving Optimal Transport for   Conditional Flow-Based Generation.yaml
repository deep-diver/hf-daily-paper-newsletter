summary: This study introduces a method called conditional optimal transport (C^2OT) to improve computational efficiency in conditional flow-based generation. It addresses the issue of conditionally skewed prior distribution during training, which causes poor performance at test time, by introducing a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix for optimal transport assignment. Experiments show that C^2OT outperforms existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets....
