summary: The study presents FaithfulSAE, a method that trains sparse autoencoders (SAEs) using a model's own synthetic dataset, addressing the issues of instability and 'fake features' in SAEs caused by training on external datasets. FaithfulSAE improves SAE performance and stability, better capturing model-internal features and reducing the dependency on external datasets....
