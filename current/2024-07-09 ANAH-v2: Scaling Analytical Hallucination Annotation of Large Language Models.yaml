summary: This paper presents a self-training framework that improves the accuracy of hallucination annotators in large language models while scaling up the annotation dataset. The framework uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and results in a new hallucination annotator that outperforms GPT-4 and achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection results on HaluEval and HalluQA by zero-shot inference. This annotator can evaluate and mitigate hallucinations in various LLMs on large-scale datas...
