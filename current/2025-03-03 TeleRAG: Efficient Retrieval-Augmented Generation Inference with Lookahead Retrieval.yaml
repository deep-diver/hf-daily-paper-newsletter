summary: The proposed TeleRAG system optimizes RAG pipelines by reducing latency with minimal GPU memory requirements, using a prefetching mechanism called lookahead retrieval to anticipate required data and transfer it from CPU to GPU in parallel with LLM generation. This leads to faster, more memory-efficient deployments of advanced RAG applications....
