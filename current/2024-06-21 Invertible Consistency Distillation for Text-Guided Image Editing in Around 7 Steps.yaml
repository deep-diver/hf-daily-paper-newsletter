summary: This paper introduces a new method called invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD) that allows text-to-image diffusion models to accurately encode real images into their latent space in just 3-4 steps. This makes it possible to do precise image manipulation without sacrificing image quality. The method also uses dynamic guidance to reduce reconstruction errors and make the inversion process more effective....
