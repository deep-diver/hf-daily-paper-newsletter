summary: The paper proposes a new image representation and compression method called
  GaussianImage, which uses 2D Gaussians and a rendering algorithm to achieve high-quality
  images with faster rendering speeds and lower memory usage compared to other methods.
  It also integrates a vector quantization technique to build an image codec that
  outperforms other compression-based methods....
