summary: The paper proposes a new image representation and compression method called GaussianImage, which uses 2D Gaussians and a rendering algorithm to achieve high-quality images with faster rendering speeds and lower memory usage compared to other methods. It also integrates a vector quantization technique to build an image codec that outperforms other compression-based methods....
