summary: The authors propose a new method to improve the interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models by reformulating reasoning as posterior inference and introducing a sparse reward function for token-level learning signals. This method encourages diverse, high-likelihood latent reasoning and avoids reward hacking, resulting in enhanced performance on seven reasoning benchmarks....
