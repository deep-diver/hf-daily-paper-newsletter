summary: This study presents a new method called Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM) that improves the efficiency of diffusion models by eliminating the need for external training data, making it more suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. TBCM achieves high-quality few-step generation with superior efficiency, reducing training time and GPU memory usage, and offers insights for future research on diffusion-generation space discrepancy and sampling strategies....
