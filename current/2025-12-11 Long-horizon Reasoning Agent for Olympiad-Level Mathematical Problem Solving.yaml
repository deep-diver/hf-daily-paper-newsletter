summary: The authors present a new method called Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV) that improves the accuracy and efficiency of verifying long reasoning processes in complex tasks by using an iterative active learning framework and expert annotations. OPV outperforms other models, achieving new state-of-the-art results and effectively detecting errors in synthetic datasets....
