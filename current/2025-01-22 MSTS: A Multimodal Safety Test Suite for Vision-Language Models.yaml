summary: This paper introduces MSTS, a test suite for evaluating the safety of vision-language models, which process both image and text inputs. The test suite consists of 400 prompts across 40 hazard categories, and the authors find clear safety issues in several open VLMs. They also find some VLMs to be safe by accident, meaning that they are safe because they fail to understand even simple test prompts. The authors translate MSTS into ten languages and find models to be safer when tested with text onl...
