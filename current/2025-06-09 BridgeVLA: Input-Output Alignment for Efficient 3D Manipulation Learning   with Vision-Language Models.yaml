summary: The study presents BridgeVLA, a new model that effectively incorporates 3D signals into vision-language models for action prediction in robot manipulation learning, addressing the issue of low sample efficiency in existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate BridgeVLA's superior performance and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods in various simulation benchmarks and real-robot experiments....
