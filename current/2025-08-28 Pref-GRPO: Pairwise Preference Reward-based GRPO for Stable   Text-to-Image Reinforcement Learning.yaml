summary: The authors address the issue of reward hacking in current text-to-image generation methods by proposing Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method. They also introduce UniGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2I models, which reveals the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source models and validates the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO....
