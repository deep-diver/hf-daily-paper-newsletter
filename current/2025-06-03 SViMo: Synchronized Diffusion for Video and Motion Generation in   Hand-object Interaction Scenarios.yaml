summary: The proposed framework generates hand-object interaction videos and motion simultaneously by combining visual information and physical laws in a synchronized process, improving consistency and eliminating the need for predefined models or explicit pose guidance. Experimental results show that this method outperforms existing approaches in generating high-quality, dynamic sequences that can generalize to unseen real-world scenarios....
