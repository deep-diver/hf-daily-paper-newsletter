summary: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify knowledge conflicts and which source of knowledge they rely on by analyzing the residual stream of the model. They find that LLMs can internally register the signal of knowledge conflict in the residual stream, which can be detected by probing the intermediate model activations. This allows them to detect conflicts within the residual stream before generating the answers and estimate the behavior of LLMs when conflict happ...
