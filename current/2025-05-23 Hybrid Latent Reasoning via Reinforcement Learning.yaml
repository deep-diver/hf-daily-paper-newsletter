summary: This study proposes a new method called HRPO that combines the strengths of large language models and latent reasoning through reinforcement learning. HRPO uses a gating mechanism to integrate hidden states with sampled tokens and gradually incorporates more hidden features during training, resulting in improved performance on various reasoning tasks while maintaining interpretability....
