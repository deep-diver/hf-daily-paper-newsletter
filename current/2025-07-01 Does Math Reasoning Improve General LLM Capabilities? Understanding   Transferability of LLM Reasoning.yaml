summary: This study examines whether improvements in math reasoning in large language models (LLMs) translate to better performance in other domains. The researchers find that models excelling in math usually struggle in other areas, and they discover that reinforcement learning (RL) tuning helps with better cross-domain generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can lead to loss of general capabilities....
