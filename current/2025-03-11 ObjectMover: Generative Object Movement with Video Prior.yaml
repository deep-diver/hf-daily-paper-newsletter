summary: The paper proposes ObjectMover, a generative model that handles complex object movement tasks in images by treating it as a sequence-to-sequence problem, leveraging the knowledge of a fine-tuned video generation model. ObjectMover is trained using a synthetic data generation pipeline and a multi-task learning strategy for improved generalization, resulting in superior performance in real-world scenarios....
