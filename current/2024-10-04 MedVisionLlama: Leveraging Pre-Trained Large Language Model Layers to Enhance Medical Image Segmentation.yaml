summary: By integrating pre-trained Large Language Model transformer blocks into the encoder of a ViT-based model, the study proposes a Hybrid Attention Mechanism and Multi-Scale Fusion Block, leading to substantial improvements in medical image segmentation performance across various modalities. The enhanced model shows significant gains in accuracy, precision, and the Jaccard Index, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-based transformers in refining medical image segmentation and boosting model accur...
