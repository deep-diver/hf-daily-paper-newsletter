summary: The authors present a new method called Tinker that allows for high-quality 3D editing using just one or two images, without needing to optimize for each specific scene. Tinker uses pre-trained models to understand the 3D structure of images and can make edits that look consistent from different viewpoints, making it easier to create 3D content....
