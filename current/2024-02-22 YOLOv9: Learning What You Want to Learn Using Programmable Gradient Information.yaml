summary: This paper proposes a new concept called Programmable Gradient Information
  (PGI) to address the issue of data loss in deep networks. They also introduce a
  new lightweight network architecture called Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation
  Network (GELAN) to utilize the PGI concept. The results of the proposed GELAN and
  PGI show better performance compared to state-of-the-art models in object detection
  tasks, even without using large pre-trained models....
