summary: This paper proposes a new concept called Programmable Gradient Information (PGI) to address the issue of data loss in deep networks. They also introduce a new lightweight network architecture called Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN) to utilize the PGI concept. The results of the proposed GELAN and PGI show better performance compared to state-of-the-art models in object detection tasks, even without using large pre-trained models....
