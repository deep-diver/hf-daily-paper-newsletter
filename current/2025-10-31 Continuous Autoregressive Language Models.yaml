summary: This study proposes a new approach for language models, Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), which shifts from predicting individual tokens to predicting continuous vector representations of multiple tokens. This method reduces the number of generative steps, improving efficiency and performance while lowering computational costs, as demonstrated by experiments....
