summary: The paper presents a scalable and simple method for generating videos from text and images, called STIV. It uses a diffusion transformer and a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance to perform both text-to-video and text-image-to-video tasks. STIV outperforms other models in video generation tasks, and its design can be easily extended to other applications....
