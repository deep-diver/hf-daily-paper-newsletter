summary: The authors present DeepEDM, a new framework that combines nonlinear dynamical systems modeling with deep neural networks for time series forecasting. DeepEDM learns a latent space from time-delayed embeddings and uses kernel regression to approximate the underlying dynamics, resulting in more accurate forecasts compared to existing methods, especially in the presence of noise....
