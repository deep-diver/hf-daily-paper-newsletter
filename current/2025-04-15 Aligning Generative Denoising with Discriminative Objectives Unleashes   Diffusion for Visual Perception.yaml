summary: This research analyzes the gap between generative diffusion processes and discriminative tasks like image perception. It finds that early denoising steps significantly impact perception quality, leading to new learning objectives; later steps can degrade perception due to distribution shifts, which is resolved by diffusion-tailored data augmentation; and generative processes can enable interactivity as a controllable user interface. These insights improve diffusion-based perception models, achie...
