summary: We propose a method to improve the accuracy of generating a specified number of objects in text-to-image models by optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object's potential. We address the challenges of using an out-of-the-box counting model by proposing an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method...
