summary: This study demonstrates that a substantial amount of alignment training data can be extracted from a post-trained model, which can enhance its capabilities like long-context reasoning, safety, and math skills. The research suggests that using embedding models for measuring success in data extraction is more effective than string matching and highlights a potential risk in extracting alignment data....
