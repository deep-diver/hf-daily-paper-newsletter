summary: The authors present StaMo, a method that learns a compact and expressive state representation for robotic motion using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer decoder. This approach improves task performance and real-world success rates while reducing inference overhead, and also discovers latent actions that can be translated into executable robot actions without explicit supervision....
