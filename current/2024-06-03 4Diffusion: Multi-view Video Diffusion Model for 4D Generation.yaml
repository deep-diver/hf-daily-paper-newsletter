summary: The paper presents a new 4D generation pipeline, 4Diffusion, that uses a unified diffusion model to generate spatial-temporally consistent 4D content from a monocular video. The model incorporates a learnable motion module into a frozen 3D-aware diffusion model to capture multi-view spatial-temporal correlations and is trained on a curated dataset. The authors also propose a 4D-aware Score Distillation Sampling loss and an anchor loss to enhance the appearance details and facilitate the learning...
