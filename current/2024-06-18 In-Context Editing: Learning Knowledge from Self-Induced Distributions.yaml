summary: 'The paper proposes a new method called Consistent In-Context Editing (ICE) to improve the existing fine-tuning paradigm for language models in knowledge editing scenarios. ICE leverages the model''s in-context learning capability to tune toward a contextual distribution rather than a one-hot target, enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of gradient-based tuning methods. The paper provides analytical insights into ICE across four critical aspects of knowledge editing: accuracy, locality, gene...'
