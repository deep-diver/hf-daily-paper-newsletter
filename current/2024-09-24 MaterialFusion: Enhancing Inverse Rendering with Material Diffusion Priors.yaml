summary: This paper introduces MaterialFusion, a new method for enhancing inverse rendering by using a 2D prior on texture and material properties. The method uses a diffusion model prior called StableMaterial, which is trained on a dataset of synthetic Blender objects called BlenderVault. The paper shows that MaterialFusion improves the appearance of reconstructed objects under novel lighting conditions compared to previous work....
