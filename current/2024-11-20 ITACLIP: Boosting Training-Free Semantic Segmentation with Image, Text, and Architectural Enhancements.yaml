summary: This paper proposes a new method called ITACLIP to improve the semantic segmentation performance of CLIP by introducing architectural changes, image engineering, and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate definitions and synonyms for each class name. The method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on various segmentation benchmarks....
