summary: LoRACLR is a method that combines multiple LoRA models, each trained for a specific concept, into a single model without needing to retrain each model individually. It uses a contrastive objective to align and merge the weight spaces of these models, ensuring they work well together while minimizing interference. This allows for efficient and scalable model composition for high-quality, multi-concept image synthesis....
