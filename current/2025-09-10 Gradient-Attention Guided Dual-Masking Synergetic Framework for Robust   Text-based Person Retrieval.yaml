summary: This study enhances the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for person representation learning by creating a large, high-quality person-centric dataset called WebPerson and introducing a new framework called GA-DMS. GA-DMS improves cross-modal alignment by masking noisy textual tokens and incorporating masked token prediction objectives, leading to better fine-grained semantic representation learning and state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks....
