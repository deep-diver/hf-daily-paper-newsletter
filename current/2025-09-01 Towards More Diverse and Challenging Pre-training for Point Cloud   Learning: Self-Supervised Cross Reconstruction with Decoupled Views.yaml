summary: This study presents a new approach called Point-PQAE for self-supervised point cloud learning using two-view cross-reconstruction, which outperforms existing single-modal self-reconstruction methods by 6.5%-7.0% in various tests. The method introduces a novel crop mechanism for point cloud view generation and a unique positional encoding to represent 3D relative positions between two decoupled views, making pre-training more challenging and informative....
