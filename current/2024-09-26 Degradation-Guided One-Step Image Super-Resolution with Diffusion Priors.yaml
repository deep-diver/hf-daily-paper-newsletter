summary: A new method for image super-resolution using a pre-trained diffusion model as a prior. It addresses efficiency issues by using a degradation-guided Low-Rank Adaptation module and a novel training pipeline. This method improves the quality of super-resolution results and outperforms other methods in efficiency and effectiveness....
