summary: OmniGlue is a learnable image matcher that uses a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process and generalize to unseen domains. It also has a keypoint position-guided attention mechanism that improves matching descriptors. It outperforms a comparable reference model by 20.9% on unseen domains and the LightGlue method by 9.5%....
