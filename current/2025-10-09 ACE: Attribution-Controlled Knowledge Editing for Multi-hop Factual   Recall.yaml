summary: The study identifies a limitation in existing knowledge editing methods for large language models, specifically their poor performance in multi-hop factual recall due to an oversight in how chained knowledge is represented and utilized at the neuron level. The researchers propose a new framework called ACE, which uses neuron-level attribution to identify and edit critical pathways, significantly improving multi-hop knowledge editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods....
