summary: The paper proposes a method to create relightable radiance fields using single-illumination data by exploiting priors from 2D image diffusion models. The method fine-tunes a 2D diffusion model on a multi-illumination dataset and uses it to create a relightable radiance field represented by 3D Gaussian splats. The appearance is represented with a multi-layer perceptron parameterized on light direction, and a per-image auxiliary feature vector is optimized to enforce multi-view consistency....
