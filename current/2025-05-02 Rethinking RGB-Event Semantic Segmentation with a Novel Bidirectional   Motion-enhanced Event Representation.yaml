summary: The study presents a new method for combining RGB images and event camera data for semantic segmentation, addressing challenges like temporal, spatial, and modal misalignment. The proposed Motion-enhanced Event Tensor and other modules significantly improve performance over existing techniques, as demonstrated by experimental results on large-scale datasets....
