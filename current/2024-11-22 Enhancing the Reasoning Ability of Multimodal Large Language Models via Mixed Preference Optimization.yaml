summary: Researchers have developed a new method called Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO) to improve the reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). They created a large dataset for multimodal reasoning and used it along with MPO to enhance the performance of MLLMs, particularly in chain-of-thought tasks. The new model, InternVL2-8B-MPO, outperforms previous models and shows comparable performance to larger models....
