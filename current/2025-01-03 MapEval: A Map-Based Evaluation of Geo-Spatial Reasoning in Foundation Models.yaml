summary: The MapEval benchmark is introduced to evaluate foundation models' geo-spatial reasoning abilities. It assesses models' performance in textual, API-based, and visual tasks related to map tools and geo-spatial contexts. The study found that while no single model excelled in all tasks, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro performed well overall. However, a significant gap exists between model performance and human performance, indicating the need for further advancements in geo-spatial un...
