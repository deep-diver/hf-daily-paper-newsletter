summary: The researchers present a new method called MoRel that efficiently models long-range motion in dynamic videos, addressing issues like memory explosion and flickering. MoRel uses anchor spaces and bidirectional blending to maintain temporal consistency and quality, and it introduces a new dataset for evaluating long-range 4D motion....
