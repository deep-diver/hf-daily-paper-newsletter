summary: The study presents TED-4DGS, a new method that efficiently compresses dynamic 3D scenes by combining temporal control and deformation schemes. This approach outperforms existing techniques on real-world datasets by using learnable parameters, a shared deformation bank, and an implicit neural representation-based hyperprior for rate-distortion compression....
