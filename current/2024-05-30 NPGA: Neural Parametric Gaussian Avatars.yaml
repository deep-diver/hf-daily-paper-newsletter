summary: This paper introduces Neural Parametric Gaussian Avatars (NPGA), a data-driven approach to create high-fidelity, controllable avatars from multi-view video recordings. NPGA uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient rendering and conditions the avatars' dynamics on the rich expression space of neural parametric head models (NPHM). The avatars are augmented with per-primitive latent features to increase representational capacity, and Laplacian terms are used to regularize the dynamic behavior. NPGA...
