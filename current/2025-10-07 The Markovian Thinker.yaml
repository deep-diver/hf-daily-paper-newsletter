summary: The authors propose a new paradigm called Markovian Thinking, which allows reasoning models to think for long periods without requiring a lot of computational resources. They introduce Delethink, an environment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks, enabling linear compute with constant memory. This approach significantly reduces computational costs compared to existing methods, making long reasoning tasks more efficient and scalable....
