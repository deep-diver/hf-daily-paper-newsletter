summary: This paper presents a localization system called HaLo-NeRF that connects neural representations of scenes depicting large-scale landmarks with text describing a semantic region within the scene by leveraging large-scale internet data containing images of similar landmarks along with weakly-related textual information. The approach uses correspondences between views of scenes to bootstrap spatial understanding of these semantics, providing guidance for 3D-compatible segmentation that ultimately l...
