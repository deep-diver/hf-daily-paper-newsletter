summary: The study presents a new algorithm, CPGD, to stabilize policy learning in language models, which addresses training instability issues in existing rule-based reinforcement learning methods. CPGD uses a policy drift constraint and a clip mechanism to prevent excessive policy updates, improving performance while maintaining training stability, and is available for use at the provided GitHub link....
