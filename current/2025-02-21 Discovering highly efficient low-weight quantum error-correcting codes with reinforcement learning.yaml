summary: This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach to optimize quantum error-correcting codes by reducing their weight, leading to significantly more efficient codes than existing methods for practical use cases. For instance, the approach reduces physical qubit overhead by 1-2 orders of magnitude for weight 6 codes, making them feasible for near-future experiments, and offers new insights into the trade-off between code parameters....
