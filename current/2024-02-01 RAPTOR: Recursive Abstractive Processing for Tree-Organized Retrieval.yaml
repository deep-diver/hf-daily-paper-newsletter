summary: A new approach called RAPTOR is introduced, which improves the retrieval of information from large text corpora by recursively summarizing the text at different levels of abstraction. This leads to better performance on tasks involving complex reasoning, and state-of-the-art results on question-answering tasks when used with GPT-4....
