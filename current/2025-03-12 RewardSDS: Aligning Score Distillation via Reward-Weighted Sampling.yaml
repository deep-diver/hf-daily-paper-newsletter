summary: The authors present a new technique called RewardSDS to improve the alignment of 2D diffusion models' outputs to user intent in tasks like text-to-3D generation. This is achieved by sampling noise samples based on their alignment with a reward model, generating a weighted SDS loss that emphasizes gradients from aligned high-reward noise samples. RewardSDS can be applied to various tasks and has been shown to outperform SDS on text-to-image, 2D editing, and text-to-3D generation tasks....
