summary: The work introduces a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that sets a new state-of-the-art performance on Craftax-classic, a complex 2D survival game. The method uses a novel policy architecture, improves sample efficiency via Dyna with warmup, nearest neighbor tokenizer, and block teacher forcing, achieving a reward of 67.4% after only 1M environment steps....
