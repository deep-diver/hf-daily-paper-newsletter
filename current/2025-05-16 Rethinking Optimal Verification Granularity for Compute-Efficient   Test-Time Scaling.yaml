summary: This study explores how often a verifier should be used during language model generation to balance performance and computational cost, introducing a new algorithm called Variable Granularity Search. Experiments show that adjusting the verifier's frequency can improve efficiency and accuracy, outperforming existing methods while reducing computational resources....
