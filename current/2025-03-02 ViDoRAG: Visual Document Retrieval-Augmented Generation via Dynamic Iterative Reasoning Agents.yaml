summary: This research addresses the challenge of understanding information from visually rich documents, which traditional RAG methods struggle with. To evaluate RAG performance, a new dataset called ViDoSeek is introduced, and a novel multi-agent RAG framework called ViDoRAG is proposed, which effectively handles multi-modal retrieval and enhances the model's reasoning capabilities through an iterative agent workflow....
