summary: This paper introduces Geoperception, a benchmark for evaluating MLLM's ability to accurately transcribe 2D geometric information from an image. The paper demonstrates the limitations of leading MLLMs and explores strategies for improving their performance on geometric tasks. The paper introduces Euclid, a family of models specifically optimized for strong low-level geometric perception, which shows strong generalization ability to novel geometry shapes....
