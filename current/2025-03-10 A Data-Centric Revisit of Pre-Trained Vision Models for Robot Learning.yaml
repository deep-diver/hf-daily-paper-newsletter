summary: The work presents SlotMIM, a method to improve object-centric representation learning in robots using pre-trained vision models. It introduces a semantic bottleneck and cross-view consistency regularization to enhance the models' performance, especially on non-(single-)object-centric datasets, and it achieves better data efficiency and scalability....
