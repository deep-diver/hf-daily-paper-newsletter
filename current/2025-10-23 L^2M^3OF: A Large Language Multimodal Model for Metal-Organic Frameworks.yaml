summary: The authors present L2M3OF, a multimodal language model specifically designed for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). L2M3OF combines crystal representation learning with language understanding, allowing it to process various types of data related to MOFs. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms other popular language models in predicting MOF properties and generating knowledge, demonstrating the potential of multimodal approaches in materials discovery....
