summary: This research explores the issue of inflated performance in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) due to test-set leakage from internet-scale, proprietary pretraining corpora. The authors propose a new method for detecting contaminated VLMs using multi-modal semantic perturbation, which they validate across multiple realistic contamination strategies, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness....
