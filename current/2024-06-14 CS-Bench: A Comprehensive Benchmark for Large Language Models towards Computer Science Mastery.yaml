summary: The paper introduces CS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the performance of large language models in computer science. It covers 26 subfields across 4 key areas and includes 5K test samples. The benchmark is used to evaluate over 30 mainstream LLMs and reveals the relationship between CS performance and model scales. It also highlights directions for improvements and shows a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science, mathematics, and coding....
