summary: This paper introduces ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source large language models. The paper argues that unlearning should be evaluated internally by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. The authors also highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parametric-based evaluations. They release their cod...
