summary: The study presents a new method called StreamSplat that can convert uncalibrated video streams into dynamic 3D models in real-time, addressing challenges in processing uncalibrated inputs, accurately modeling dynamic scenes, and maintaining efficiency. This method introduces a probabilistic sampling mechanism and a bidirectional deformation field, which enable robust and efficient dynamic modeling, and outperforms prior works in reconstruction quality and dynamic scene modeling....
