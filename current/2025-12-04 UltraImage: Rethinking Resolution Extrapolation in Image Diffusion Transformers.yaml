summary: The researchers developed UltraImage, a framework that improves high-resolution image generation by addressing content repetition and quality degradation. They found that repetition is caused by the periodicity of the dominant frequency in positional embeddings and proposed a correction method. Quality degradation was linked to diluted attention, which they fixed with an entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration technique. UltraImage outperforms previous methods and can generate images up ...
