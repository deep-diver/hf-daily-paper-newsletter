summary: The authors present AgentsNet, a new benchmark for measuring the performance of multi-agent systems in collaborative problem-solving, self-organization, and communication, based on network topology. They test various methods on AgentsNet and find that while some advanced language models perform well for small networks, their performance decreases as the network size grows, highlighting the need for further research in scaling multi-agent systems....
