summary: This research proposes that token reduction in Transformer architectures should be viewed as a crucial principle in generative modeling, rather than just an efficiency strategy. The study suggests that token reduction can enhance multimodal integration, reduce hallucinations, maintain input coherence, and improve training stability in vision, language, and multimodal systems....
