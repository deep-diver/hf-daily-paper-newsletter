summary: The authors present VQRAE, a new method that combines representation autoencoders with vector quantization to unify multimodal understanding, generation, and reconstruction. VQRAE uses a symmetric ViT decoder and a two-stage training strategy to create continuous semantic features for image understanding and discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer, achieving competitive performance on various benchmarks....
