summary: The abstract introduces 3D-GRAND, a large-scale dataset with 40,087 household scenes and 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions to improve the grounding capabilities and reduce hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. The authors also propose a new benchmark called 3D-POPE to evaluate the hallucinations in these models. The results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances the grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. The authors also highlight the...
