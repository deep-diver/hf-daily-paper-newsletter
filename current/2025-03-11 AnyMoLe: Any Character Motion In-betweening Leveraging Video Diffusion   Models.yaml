summary: This work presents a new method, AnyMoLe, that generates motion in-between frames for any character, without the need for character-specific datasets, by using video diffusion models and a two-stage frame generation process. To improve compatibility between real and rendered animations, the researchers also propose a fine-tuning technique, ICAdapt, and a 'motion-video mimicking' optimization technique....
