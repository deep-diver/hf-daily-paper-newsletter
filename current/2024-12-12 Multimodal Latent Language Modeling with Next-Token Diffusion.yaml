summary: This paper introduces Latent Language Modeling (LatentLM), a unified approach for handling discrete and continuous data in multimodal generative models. LatentLM uses causal Transformers, a variational autoencoder (VAE), and next-token diffusion for autoregressive generation. It also addresses the challenges of variance collapse and achieves favorable performance in various modalities, including image generation, text-to-speech synthesis, and integration with large language models....
