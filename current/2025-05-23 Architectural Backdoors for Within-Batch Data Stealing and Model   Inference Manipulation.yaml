summary: The study presents a new type of backdoor attack that exploits batched inference to manipulate and steal data from neural network models. The attack allows an adversary to control model responses for other users within the same batch and represents a significant threat to user privacy and system integrity. The researchers also propose a novel mitigation strategy that provides formal guarantees against this attack vector by using a new Information Flow Control mechanism....
