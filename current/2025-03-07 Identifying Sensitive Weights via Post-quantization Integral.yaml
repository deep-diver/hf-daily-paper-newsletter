summary: This work examines the limitations of existing gradient and Hessian-based sensitivity metrics in post-training weight quantization and proposes Post-quantization Integral (PQI) for a more accurate and fine-grained estimation. The authors also present ReQuant, a framework using PQI for self-adaptive outlier selection and step-wise significant weights detach, which improves state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods with a 2.66 perplexity gain on Llama 3.2 1B using QTIP....
