summary: This study discovers that attention scores decrease with spatial and temporal distance in video diffusion models, and proposes Radial Attention, a more efficient sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) complexity that translates this energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density. The new method allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient fine-tuning, maintaining video quality while achieving significant speedup and cost reduction compa...
