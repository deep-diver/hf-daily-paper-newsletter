summary: The study presents AdaptiVocab, a method that improves the efficiency of language models in specific domains by adjusting vocabulary. This approach reduces computational costs and latency by using domain-specific n-gram-based tokens, and can be applied to any tokenizer or architecture. Results show that AdaptiVocab reduces token usage by over 25% without performance loss....
