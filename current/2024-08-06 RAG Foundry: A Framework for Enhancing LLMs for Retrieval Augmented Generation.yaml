summary: RAG Foundry is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of creating and evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by integrating data creation, training, inference, and evaluation into a single workflow. This allows for rapid prototyping and experimentation with various RAG techniques and demonstrates effectiveness by improving the performance of Llama-3 and Phi-3 models on knowledge-intensive datasets....
