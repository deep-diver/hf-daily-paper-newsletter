summary: This paper introduces a new method for tokenizing robot actions called Frequency-space Action Sequence Tokenization (FAST). This method uses the discrete cosine transform to compress action signals and enables the training of autoregressive vision-language-action models for highly dexterous and high-frequency tasks. The paper also introduces FAST+, a universal robot action tokenizer that can be used as a black-box tokenizer for a wide range of robot action sequences. The method can scale to trai...
