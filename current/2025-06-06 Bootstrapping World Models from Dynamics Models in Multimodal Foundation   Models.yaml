summary: 'The study investigates the creation of realistic world and dynamics models using vision-and-language foundation models. They discover that training these models to understand dynamics (observation to action) is easier than teaching them a world model (observation, action, and subsequent observation). They then use dynamics models to improve world models through two methods: expanding training data and guiding inference time search, ultimately achieving competitive performance in action-centric i...'
