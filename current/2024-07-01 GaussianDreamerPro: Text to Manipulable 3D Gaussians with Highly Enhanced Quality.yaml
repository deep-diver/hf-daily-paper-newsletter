summary: This paper introduces GaussianDreamerPro, a novel framework that improves the quality of generated 3D Gaussian assets from text by binding them to reasonable geometry. The framework progressively enriches both the geometry and appearance, resulting in significantly enhanced details and quality. The generated assets can be seamlessly integrated into downstream manipulation pipelines, promoting their potential in wide applications....
