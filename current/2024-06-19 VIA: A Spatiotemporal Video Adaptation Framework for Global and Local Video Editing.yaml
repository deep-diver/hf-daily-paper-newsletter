summary: This paper introduces VIA, a new video editing framework that improves consistency and precision in both global and local contexts. It uses a test-time editing adaptation method to adapt a pre-trained image editing model and introduces spatiotemporal adaptation to maintain global consistency over the video sequence. Experiments show that VIA produces more faithful and coherent edits compared to baseline methods, and can achieve consistent long video editing in minutes....
