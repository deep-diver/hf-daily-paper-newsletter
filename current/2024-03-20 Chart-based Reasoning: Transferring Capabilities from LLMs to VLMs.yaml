summary: A new technique is proposed to transfer reasoning capabilities from large-language models to vision-language models, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on multimodal tasks such as ChartQA. This is achieved by improving chart representation, constructing a larger dataset, and fine-tuning with a multitask loss. The resulting model outperforms even larger models without using an upstream OCR system and keeps inference time constant....
