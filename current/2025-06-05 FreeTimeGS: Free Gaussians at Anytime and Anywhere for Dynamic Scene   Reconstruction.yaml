summary: The authors present a new method, FreeTimeGS, to improve the reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes with complex motions. Instead of relying on deformation fields that are hard to optimize, FreeTimeGS uses a 4D representation that allows Gaussian primitives to appear at any time and location, providing more flexibility and reducing temporal redundancy, resulting in better rendering quality compared to recent methods....
