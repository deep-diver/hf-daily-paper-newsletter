summary: The study presents a new method to improve large language models by using a 'Mistake Log' to track and learn from errors made during fine-tuning. This approach, called Transformer Copilot, combines a 'Pilot' model with a 'Copilot' model that corrects the Pilot's mistakes, resulting in better performance on various tasks with minimal additional computational cost....
