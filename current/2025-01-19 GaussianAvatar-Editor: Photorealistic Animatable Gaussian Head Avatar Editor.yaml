summary: We present a new method called GaussianAvatar-Editor to edit animatable Gaussian head avatars in a text-driven manner. This method handles issues related to motion occlusion and spatial-temporal inconsistency by using a Weighted Alpha Blending Equation (WABE) and incorporating conditional adversarial learning into the editing process. Our method achieves photorealistic and consistent results in animatable 4D Gaussian editing, as demonstrated by our experiments....
