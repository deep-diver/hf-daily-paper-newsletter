summary: The authors propose a new reinforcement learning framework called Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO) that allows large reasoning models to learn how deep to reason based on the complexity of the problem, without sacrificing their ability. Experiments show that this method reduces token usage by up to 60.6% and improves accuracy by 3.14% compared to existing methods, enabling models to automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity....
