summary: The research presents a new method called AutoRefine that improves the reasoning ability of large language models by allowing them to query external resources more effectively. AutoRefine uses a reinforcement learning framework to filter, distill, and organize evidence, resulting in more accurate and high-quality search results, especially in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios....
