summary: While 3D content generation has advanced significantly, existing methods still face challenges with input formats, latent space design, and output representations. This paper introduces a novel 3D generation framework that addresses these challenges, offering scalable, high-quality 3D generation with an interactive Point Cloud-structured Latent space. Our framework employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with multi-view posed RGB-D(epth)-N(ormal) renderings as input, using a unique latent space ...
