summary: The study presents X-Omni, a framework that uses reinforcement learning to improve the quality of discrete autoregressive image generation models, enabling better integration of image and language generation. X-Omni, which includes a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model, and an offline diffusion decoder, outperforms existing methods in image generation tasks using a 7B language model, producing high-quality images that follow instructions and render long texts effectively....
