summary: This study discovers specific neurons in language models, called 'truth neurons,' that consistently encode truthfulness, making the models more reliable and safer to use. The existence of these neurons is confirmed across different models, and suppressing them harms the model's performance on various tasks, indicating the importance of truthfulness mechanisms in language models....
