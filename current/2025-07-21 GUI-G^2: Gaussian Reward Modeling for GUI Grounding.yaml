summary: This study presents a new reward framework called GUI-G^2 that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions, improving upon existing reinforcement learning approaches that use binary rewards. The framework's two mechanisms, Gaussian point rewards and coverage rewards, enable more precise localization and spatial alignment, leading to better performance and robustness in GUI interaction tasks....
