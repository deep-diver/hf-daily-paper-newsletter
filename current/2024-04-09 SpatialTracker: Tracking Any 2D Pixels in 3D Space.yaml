summary: This paper proposes a method called SpatialTracker to improve video tracking by estimating point trajectories in 3D space using monocular depth estimators and a transformer. The method leverages as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) constraints and learns a rigidity embedding to cluster pixels into different rigid parts, resulting in improved tracking performance, particularly in challenging scenarios such as out-of-plane rotation....
