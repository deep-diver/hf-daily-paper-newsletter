summary: This study presents a controlled experimental framework to investigate the impact of pre-training, mid-training, and RL on reasoning language models. The results reveal that RL enhances model performance when pre-training leaves room for improvement, RL data targets the model's edge of competence, and mid-training significantly boosts performance compared to RL alone....
