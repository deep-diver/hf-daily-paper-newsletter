summary: This research introduces a novel way to perform domain adaptation for image restoration tasks using diffusion models. Instead of aligning features or pixels, it guides the model to progressively align restored synthetic and real-world outputs with a target clean distribution in the noise space, overcoming challenges in low-level vision tasks....
