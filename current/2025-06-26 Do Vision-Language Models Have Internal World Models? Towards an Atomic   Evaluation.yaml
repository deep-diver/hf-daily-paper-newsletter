summary: The study proposes a two-stage framework to evaluate the world modeling abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in perception and prediction. Through extensive experiments, it finds that VLMs have significant limitations in basic world modeling tasks, like distinguishing motion trajectories and understanding object properties independently of their color....
