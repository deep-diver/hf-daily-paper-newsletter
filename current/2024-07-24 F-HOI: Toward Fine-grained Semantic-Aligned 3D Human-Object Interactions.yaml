summary: We propose a new method called F-HOI to improve understanding of 3D human-object interactions by using detailed descriptions of each action. We create a new dataset called Semantic-HOI with over 20,000 paired interactions and descriptions. F-HOI uses multimodal instructions and large language models to handle various tasks related to these interactions. Experiments show that F-HOI aligns actions with detailed descriptions and performs well on understanding, reasoning, generation, and reconstruct...
