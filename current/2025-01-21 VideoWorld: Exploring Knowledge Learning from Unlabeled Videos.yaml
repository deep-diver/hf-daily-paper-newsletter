summary: This paper introduces VideoWorld, a deep generative model that learns complex knowledge from unlabeled videos. The model is trained on video data and tested in video-based Go and robotic control tasks. The study reveals that video-only training provides sufficient information for learning knowledge and that the representation of visual change is crucial for knowledge acquisition. The model, VideoWorld, reaches a professional level in the Video-GoBench and effectively learns diverse control opera...
