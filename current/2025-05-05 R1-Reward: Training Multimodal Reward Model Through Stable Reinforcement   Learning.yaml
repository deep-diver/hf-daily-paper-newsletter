summary: This research proposes a new method called StableReinforce to improve the training stability and performance of Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed algorithm refines the training loss, advantage estimation strategy, and reward design of existing RL methods, resulting in a significant improvement in the performance of MRMs on various benchmarks compared to previous state-of-the-art models....
