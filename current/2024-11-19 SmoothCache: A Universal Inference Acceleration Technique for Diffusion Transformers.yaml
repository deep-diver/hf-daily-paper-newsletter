summary: We developed a new technique called SmoothCache to speed up the inference process of Diffusion Transformers, which are used to create images, videos, and sounds. This technique saves and reuses important information from the model's previous calculations, resulting in faster processing times without sacrificing the quality of the generated content. SmoothCache works well across different types of media and can help make real-time applications possible for these powerful models....
