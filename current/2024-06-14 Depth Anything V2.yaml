summary: Depth Anything V2 is a powerful monocular depth estimation model that uses synthetic images, a scaled-up teacher model, and large-scale pseudo-labeled real images to produce more accurate and robust depth predictions. It is more efficient than the latest models built on Stable Diffusion and offers models of different scales to support various scenarios. The model's strong generalization capability is further improved by fine-tuning with metric depth labels, and a versatile evaluation benchmark i...
