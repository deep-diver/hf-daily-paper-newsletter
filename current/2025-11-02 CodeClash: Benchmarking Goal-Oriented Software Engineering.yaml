summary: The study presents CodeClash, a benchmark for evaluating language models in goal-oriented software engineering, where models compete in multi-round tournaments to build the best codebase for achieving a competitive objective. Results show that while models have diverse development styles, they struggle with strategic reasoning and long-term codebase maintenance, losing to expert human programmers in every round....
