summary: This study explores the relationship between training dynamics and quantization performance in large language models, finding that learning rate and other hyperparameters significantly impact quantization errors. The research introduces controlled experiments to identify specific configurations that can enhance quantization robustness, challenging the assumption that larger datasets necessarily reduce quantization effectiveness....
