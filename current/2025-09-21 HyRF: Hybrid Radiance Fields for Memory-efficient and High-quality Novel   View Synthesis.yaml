summary: The authors present HyRF, a new method for 3D scene representation that combines explicit Gaussians and neural fields to improve memory efficiency and rendering quality compared to previous methods like 3DGS. HyRF uses a compact set of Gaussians for high-frequency parameters and neural fields for other properties, resulting in a smaller model size and faster performance without sacrificing detail in the rendered scenes....
