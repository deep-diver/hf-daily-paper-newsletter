summary: The authors present a method called WorldWarp that combines a 3D geometric cache and a 2D generative model to create long video clips with consistent and detailed visuals. By using a technique called Spatio-Temporal Diffusion, WorldWarp can fill in missing or occluded parts of the video while maintaining the overall 3D structure, resulting in high-quality video content....
