summary: The proposed Dita framework scales up a diffusion transformer model to handle diverse action spaces in vision-language-action tasks. It uses in-context conditioning to align denoised actions with visual tokens from historical observations, enhancing the model's ability to handle various variances and execute long-horizon tasks....
