summary: This paper introduces API-BLEND, a large dataset for training and testing
  Large Language Models (LLMs) that can use external Application Programming Interfaces
  (APIs) to complete tasks. The dataset includes scenarios involving API detection,
  slot filling, and API sequencing, and can be used to evaluate the performance of
  LLMs in these tasks....
