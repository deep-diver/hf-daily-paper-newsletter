summary: VL-RewardBench is a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language generative reward models, which are important for creating AI systems that work with both images and language. The benchmark includes challenging tasks like detecting when AI systems make up images and doing complex reasoning. When tested on 16 different AI systems, even the best one only got 65.4% of the answers right. This shows that these AI systems still have a lot to learn, and VL-RewardBench can help them get better....
