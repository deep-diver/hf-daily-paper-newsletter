summary: This paper identifies a common pitfall of margin-based language model alignment methods, called gradient entanglement, where the change in the preferred probability is coupled to the gradient of the dispreferred one, often preventing the preferred probability from increasing while the dispreferred one decreases, and vice versa. The paper theoretically investigates why such inner products can be large when aligning language models and empirically validates their findings. Empirical implications o...
