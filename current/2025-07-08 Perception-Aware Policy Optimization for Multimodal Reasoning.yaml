summary: The authors present Perception-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO), a new method that improves multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models by enhancing their ability to understand visual inputs. PAPO, an extension of GRPO, encourages the model to learn perception and reasoning simultaneously, using internal supervision signals, and leads to significant improvements on multimodal benchmarks, especially for vision-dependent tasks....
