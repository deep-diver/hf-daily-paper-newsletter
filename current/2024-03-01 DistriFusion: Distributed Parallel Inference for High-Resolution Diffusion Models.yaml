summary: This paper presents DistriFusion, a method to generate high-resolution images using diffusion models with multiple GPUs. It splits the input into patches, assigns each to a GPU, and uses displaced patch parallelism to reuse pre-computed feature maps for context, achieving up to a 6.1x speedup with no quality loss....
