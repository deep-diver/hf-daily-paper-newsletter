summary: This paper presents Listwise Preference Optimization (LiPO), a framework for aligning language models with human feedback by treating ranking as a listwise problem. LiPO is an alternative to traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its specific method LiPO-Î» performs better than DPO and SLiC on two preference alignment tasks....
