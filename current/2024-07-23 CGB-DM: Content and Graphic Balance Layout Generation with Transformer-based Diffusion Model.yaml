summary: The paper proposes a new method called CGB-DM to improve the quality of layout generation in intelligent design. It balances the focus on content and graphic elements and introduces a graphic constraint to improve the alignment of geometric features. The method uses a transformer-based diffusion model as its backbone and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations....
