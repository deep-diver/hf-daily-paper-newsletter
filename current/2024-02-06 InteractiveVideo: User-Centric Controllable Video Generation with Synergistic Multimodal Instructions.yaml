summary: This paper presents a user-centric framework, InteractiveVideo, that allows users to create customized videos by employing various modalities (text, image, painting, etc.) to control the video generation process. The proposed Synergistic Multimodal Instruction mechanism facilitates a cooperative and responsive interaction between user inputs and the generative process, enabling iterative and precise manipulation of the video generation result to meet users' requirements....
