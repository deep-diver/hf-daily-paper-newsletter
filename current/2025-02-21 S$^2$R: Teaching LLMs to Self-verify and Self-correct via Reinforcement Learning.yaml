summary: The paper presents S^2R, a framework to improve LLM reasoning by teaching models to self-verify and self-correct during inference. S^2R initializes LLMs with iterative self-verification and self-correction behaviors through supervised fine-tuning and then strengthens these skills using reinforcement learning, resulting in significant accuracy improvements....
