summary: This paper introduces Caduceus, a family of bi-directional long-range DNA language models that are capable of understanding the complexities of DNA sequences. These models are capable of modeling long-range interactions, taking into account upstream and downstream regions, and accounting for the reverse complementarity of DNA. Caduceus outperforms previous models on downstream benchmarks, including a challenging variant effect prediction task....
