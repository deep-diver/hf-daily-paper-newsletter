summary: This paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The authors classify the video generation tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories, and introduce Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with input semantics and better preserve content respectively. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSR-VTT benchmark and human eva...
