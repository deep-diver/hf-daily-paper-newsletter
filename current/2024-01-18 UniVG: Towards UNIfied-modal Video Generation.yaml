summary: This paper proposes a Unified-modal Video Generation system that is capable of handling multiple video generation tasks across text and image modalities. The system classifies tasks into high-freedom and low-freedom categories and employs Multi-condition Cross Attention and Biased Gaussian Noise to generate videos that align with the semantics of the input conditions and better preserve their content. The method achieves the lowest Fréchet Video Distance on a public benchmark and performs well ...
