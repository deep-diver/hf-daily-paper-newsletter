summary: The authors present DreamGym, a unified framework that generates diverse experiences for large language model agents to learn effectively through reinforcement learning, without the need for expensive real-world interactions. DreamGym improves the training process by using a reasoning-based model to create consistent state transitions, an experience replay buffer, and adaptive task generation, leading to substantial performance improvements in various environments and agent backbones....
