summary: 'GameNGen is a game engine that uses a neural model for real-time interaction in a complex environment. It can simulate DOOM at 20 fps on a single TPU, with next frame prediction achieving a PSNR of 29.4. It''s trained in two phases: an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations ensure stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories....'
