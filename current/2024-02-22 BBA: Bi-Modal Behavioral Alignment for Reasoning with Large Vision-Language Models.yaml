summary: Introduces the Bi-Modal Behavioral Alignment (BBA) prompting method to improve
  performance of large vision-language models in complex multi-modal reasoning tasks
  by guiding them to create separate reasoning chains for visual and DSL representations,
  and aligning them to achieve cohesive integration of behaviors from different modalities,
  demonstrated in experiments on geometry problems, chess positional advantage prediction,
  and molecular property prediction, resulting in significant performance...
