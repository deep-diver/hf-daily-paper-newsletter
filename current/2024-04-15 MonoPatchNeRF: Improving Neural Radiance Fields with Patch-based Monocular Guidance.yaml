summary: This paper proposes a patch-based approach that uses monocular surface normal and relative depth predictions to improve the geometric accuracy of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), partially closing the performance gap between NeRF and traditional multiview stereo (MVS) methods. The approach also uses appearance regularization and density restrictions based on sparse structure-from-motion points to improve accuracy. Experiments show a significant improvement in performance on the ETH3D MVS benchmark...
