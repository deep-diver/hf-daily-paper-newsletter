summary: This paper presents IllumiNeRF, a method for 3D relighting that uses image diffusion models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to relight input images and reconstruct them into a 3D representation. This approach is simpler and more efficient than traditional inverse rendering methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on relighting benchmarks....
