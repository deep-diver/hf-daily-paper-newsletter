summary: The paper explores the use of reinforcement learning for dexterous robot manipulation on humanoids, addressing challenges such as long-horizon contact-rich tasks, sample efficiency, and sim-to-real performance. It introduces techniques like an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward design scheme, a divide-and-conquer distillation process, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations, showing successful results on three humanoid dexterous manipulation tasks....
