summary: This paper introduces Agile But Safe (ABS), a learning-based control framework
  for quadrupedal robots. ABS enables fast and safe locomotion by combining an agile
  policy for navigating obstacles and a recovery policy for preventing failures. This
  is achieved using a learned network that guides the recovery policy and keeps the
  robot safe in a closed loop. The training process involves learning the agile policy,
  the reach-avoid value network, the recovery policy, and an exteroception representatio...
