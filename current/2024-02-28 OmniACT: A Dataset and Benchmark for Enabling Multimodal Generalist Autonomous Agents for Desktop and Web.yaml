summary: This paper introduces OmniACT, a dataset and benchmark for assessing the
  ability of virtual agents to generate executable programs to automate computer tasks,
  including tasks that extend beyond traditional web automation. The benchmark provides
  a platform to evaluate the progress of language model agents in automating computer
  tasks and motivates future work towards building multimodal models that bridge language
  models and the visual grounding of computer screens....
