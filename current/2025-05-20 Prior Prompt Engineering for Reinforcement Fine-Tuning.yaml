summary: The study explores the impact of prior prompt engineering (pPE) on reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) of language models (LMs). By translating five inference-time prompt engineering (iPE) strategies into pPE approaches, the research finds that pPE-trained models outperform iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach yielding the largest performance gain and best results on various benchmarks....
