summary: This paper presents MIDI, a new approach for creating 3D scenes from a single image. Unlike other methods that require multiple steps or complex processes, MIDI uses a multi-instance attention mechanism to capture interactions and spatial coherence between objects. The method models object completion during 3D generation and supervises interactions between 3D instances using limited scene-level data. MIDI achieves state-of-the-art performance in image-to-scene generation....
