summary: This study proposes two new methods to enhance the accuracy of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel coordinates on GUIs, particularly for high-resolution displays. The first method, RULER tokens, acts as explicit coordinate markers, while the second, Interleaved MRoPE, ensures equal representation of width and height dimensions in spatial encoding, resulting in improved GUI automation across various resolutions and platforms....
