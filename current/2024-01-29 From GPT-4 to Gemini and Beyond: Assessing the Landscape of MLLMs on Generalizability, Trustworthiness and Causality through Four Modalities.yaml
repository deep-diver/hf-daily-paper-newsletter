summary: This paper examines the abilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
  in handling generalization, trustworthiness, and causal reasoning with respect to
  text, code, image, and video, using 230 manually designed cases. They evaluate the
  closed-source GPT-4 and Gemini, and 6 open-source LLMs and MLLMs, ultimately aiming
  to improve the transparency of MLLMs and enhance the reliability of downstream applications....
