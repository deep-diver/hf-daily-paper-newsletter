summary: This research presents a method to improve learning efficiency in autoregressive models by enabling them to act and explore using their internal representations. The proposed approach, called 'internal RL', allows the model to generate actions from a higher-order, non-causal sequence model, which in turn controls the residual stream activations of the base autoregressive model. This technique helps the model learn from sparse rewards and perform hierarchical reinforcement learning on complex tas...
