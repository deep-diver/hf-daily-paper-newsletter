summary: Large AI models often struggle to learn complex tasks quickly, especially when rewards are rare, because they act one tiny step at a time. A new method allows these models to learn much faster by having an internal "boss brain" create and use bigger, more meaningful action shortcuts, helping them explore efficiently and succeed even with very few rewards....
