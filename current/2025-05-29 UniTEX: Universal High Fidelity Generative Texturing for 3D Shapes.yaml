summary: The authors propose UniTEX, a new framework for creating high-quality 3D textures by operating directly in a unified 3D space, avoiding the challenges of UV mapping. UniTEX uses Texture Functions and a transformer-based model to predict textures from images and geometry inputs, resulting in superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing methods....
