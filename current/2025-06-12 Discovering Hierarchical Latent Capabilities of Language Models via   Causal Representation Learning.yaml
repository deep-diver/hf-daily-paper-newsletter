summary: The study presents a framework for evaluating language models by treating benchmark performance as a linear transformation of latent capability factors, which helps to control for complex confounding effects and reduce computational costs. The researchers apply this method to a large dataset of models and identify a three-node causal structure, revealing that general problem-solving skills lead to better instruction-following, which in turn improves mathematical reasoning ability....
