summary: The authors present a new method called RICE that improves region-based visual understanding and OCR capabilities, specifically addressing the limitations of current vision-language contrastive models in dense prediction tasks. RICE uses a large-scale candidate region dataset, a Region Transformer layer, and a unified region cluster discrimination loss to enhance object and OCR learning, outperforming previous methods in various tasks and being publicly available for use....
