summary: The authors present MetaSynth, a method that generates diverse synthetic data using meta-prompting and LLM agents, which helps adapt LLMs to specific domains, like Finance and Biomedicine, without compromising their capabilities in general tasks. MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine, compared to models trained on data generated using a template prompt....
