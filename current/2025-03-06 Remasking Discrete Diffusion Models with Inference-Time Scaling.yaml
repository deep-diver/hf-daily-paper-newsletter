summary: The remasking diffusion model (ReMDM) sampler is proposed to overcome the limitation of modern masked discrete diffusion that cannot update generated tokens after creation. ReMDM provides a form of inference-time compute scaling to discrete diffusion models, allowing for improved natural language and image outputs, and better controllability in scientific domains like molecule design....
