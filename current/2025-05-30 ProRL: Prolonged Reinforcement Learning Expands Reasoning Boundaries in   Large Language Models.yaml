summary: The study presents ProRL, a new training method for language models that uses reinforcement learning to discover reasoning strategies beyond what base models can achieve. The researchers found that RL-trained models consistently outperformed base models in various evaluations, and that the improvements in reasoning abilities were linked to the base model's competence and the duration of training....
