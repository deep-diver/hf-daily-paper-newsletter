summary: The paper presents 4D LangSplat, a method that learns 4D language fields from text generated from object-wise video captions using MLLMs to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently, and introduces a status deformable network to model continuous changes over time....
