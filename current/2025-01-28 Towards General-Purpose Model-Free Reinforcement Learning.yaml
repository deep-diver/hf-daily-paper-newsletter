summary: The paper proposes a unifying model-free deep RL algorithm, MR.Q, that uses model-based representations to approximate value function linearity. By leveraging this approach, MR.Q achieves competitive performance on various RL benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters, promoting the development of general-purpose model-free deep RL algorithms....
