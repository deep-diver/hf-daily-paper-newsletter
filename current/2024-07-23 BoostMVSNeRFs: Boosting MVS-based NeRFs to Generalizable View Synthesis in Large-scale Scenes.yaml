summary: This paper proposes BoostMVSNeRFs, a method to improve the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. It addresses limitations such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views by selecting and combining multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. BoostMVSNeRFs is end-to-end trainable and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Experiments on large-scale datasets show significant improvements ...
