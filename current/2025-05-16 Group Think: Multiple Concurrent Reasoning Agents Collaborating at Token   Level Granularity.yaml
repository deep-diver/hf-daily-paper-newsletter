summary: The authors present Group Think, a new approach that employs a single large language model to act as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, allowing them to collaborate at the token level and reduce latency compared to turn-based collaboration. This method enables more efficient use of computational resources and can be applied to existing language models for edge inference....
