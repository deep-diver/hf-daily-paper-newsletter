summary: This paper presents a new state-of-the-art algorithm for exact 3times3 matrix multiplication over general non-commutative rings, achieving a rank-23 scheme with only 58 scalar additions. This improves the previous best additive complexity of 60 additions without a change of basis. The result was discovered through an automated search combining ternary-restricted flip-graph exploration with greedy intersection reduction for common subexpression elimination. The resulting scheme uses only coeffici...
