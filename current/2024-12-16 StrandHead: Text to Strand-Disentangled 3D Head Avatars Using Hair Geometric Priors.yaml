summary: This paper introduces StrandHead, a new method for creating 3D head avatars that can generate realistic hair strands from text prompts. It uses a series of reliable priors to ensure stable optimization and text-aligned performance. The generated 3D hair can be used in physical simulations and other applications, and the code will be available at https://xiaokunsun.github.io/StrandHead.github.io....
