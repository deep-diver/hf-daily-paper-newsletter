summary: The paper discusses the generalization of synthetic image detectors in the face of new and better image generation models. Results suggest that no single detector is universal, but an ensemble could be. Experiments on real-world data show that the task is more challenging than defined by large-scale datasets, indicating a gap between experimentation and actual practice. The paper also observes a race equilibrium effect where better generators lead to better detectors and vice versa, suggesting a...
