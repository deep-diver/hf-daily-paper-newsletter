summary: The paper introduces pix2gestalt, a framework for zero-shot amodal segmentation. It uses large-scale diffusion models to learn to reconstruct whole objects in challenging cases, including those that break natural and physical rules. It uses a synthetically curated dataset for training and outperforms supervised baselines on established benchmarks....
