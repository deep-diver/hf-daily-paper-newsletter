summary: The paper introduces pix2gestalt, a framework for zero-shot amodal segmentation.
  It uses large-scale diffusion models to learn to reconstruct whole objects in challenging
  cases, including those that break natural and physical rules. It uses a synthetically
  curated dataset for training and outperforms supervised baselines on established
  benchmarks....
