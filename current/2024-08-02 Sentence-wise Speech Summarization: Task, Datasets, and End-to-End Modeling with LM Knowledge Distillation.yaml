summary: 'This paper proposes a new method called Sen-SSum for generating summaries from spoken documents sentence by sentence. They created two datasets for this purpose, Mega-SSum and CSJ-SSum. They evaluated two types of models: cascade models and end-to-end models. End-to-end models are easier to develop but perform worse. So they introduced knowledge distillation using pseudo-summaries from cascade models, which improved the performance of the end-to-end models....'
