summary: The authors present Fara-7B, a new computer use agent model that can understand and interact with computers using only screenshots and predicted coordinates. They trained Fara-7B using FaraGen, a synthetic data generation system, and it outperforms other similar-sized models and competes with larger ones, demonstrating the power of large-scale data generation for efficient agentic models. The model and a new benchmark are made publicly available....
