summary: The researchers developed DMOSpeech 2, which optimizes all components of a text-to-speech system, including duration prediction, using reinforcement learning. They also introduced a new method called teacher-guided sampling, which improves output diversity and efficiency, resulting in better performance compared to previous systems....
