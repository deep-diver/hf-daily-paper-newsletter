summary: The study presents ReForm, a method that improves the translation of natural language math problems into formal statements by incorporating self-reflection and iterative refinement, addressing the limitations of current Large Language Models. To train this reflective model, the study introduces PBSO, which ensures accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, leading to significant improvements over baseline models and demonstrating the inherent difficulty of autoformalization....
