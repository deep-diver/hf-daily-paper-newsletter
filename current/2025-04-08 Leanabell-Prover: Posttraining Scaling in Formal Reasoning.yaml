summary: This study explores posttraining scaling in formal reasoning by training ATP models with a hybrid dataset, including numerous statement-proof pairs and data aimed at emulating human reasoning. The research also investigates reinforcement learning using outcome rewards from the Lean 4 compiler, successfully improving existing provers and achieving state-of-the-art performance, such as a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F....
