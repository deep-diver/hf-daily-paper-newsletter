summary: 'The paper introduces a new method called Template-based Data Generation (TDG) to generate high-quality mathematical problems and solutions using large language models (LLMs). This method is used to create TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM, a dataset of over 7 million grade school math problems that can be used to train, fine-tune, and evaluate LLMs in mathematical reasoning. The dataset and code are publicly available....'
