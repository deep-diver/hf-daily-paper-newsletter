summary: 'This study explores what aspect of a target representation is crucial for generation: global semantic information or spatial structure. Through a large-scale analysis and experiments, the researchers found that spatial structure, not global performance, significantly impacts generation performance. They then introduced a simple method, iREPA, which improves the convergence speed of representation alignment, demonstrating the importance of spatial information in generative model training....'
