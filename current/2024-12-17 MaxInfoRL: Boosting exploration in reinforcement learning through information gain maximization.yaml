summary: This paper proposes a new framework called MaxInfoRL for balancing intrinsic and extrinsic exploration in reinforcement learning. It steers exploration towards informative transitions by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about the underlying task. The approach achieves sublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits and outperforms other methods in hard exploration problems and complex visual control tasks....
