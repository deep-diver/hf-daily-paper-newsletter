link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.06772
summary: The study introduces ReasonFlux, a model that improves LLM reasoning through thought templates, achieving state-of-the-art math reasoning capabilities. Using a library of thought templates, hierarchical reinforcement learning, and a new inference scaling system, ReasonFlux-32B outperforms other models like OpenAI o1-preview and DeepSeek V3, especially on the MATH and AIME benchmarks....
