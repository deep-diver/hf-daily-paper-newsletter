summary: This study presents MesaTask, a framework that uses spatial reasoning to create realistic tabletop scenes based on task descriptions, addressing the challenge of generating task-relevant scenes for robot training. The framework, enhanced with DPO algorithms, outperforms baselines in generating plausible scenes that align with given tasks, using a large-scale dataset of over 10,000 synthetic tabletop scenes....
