link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.05282
summary: The authors present a new method called Rectified Point Flow that combines point cloud registration and shape assembly into a single problem. This approach learns the correct positions of points in a cloud without needing symmetry labels and outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks by leveraging shared geometric priors....
