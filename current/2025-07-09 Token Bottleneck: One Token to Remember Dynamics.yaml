summary: The study presents a new method called Token Bottleneck (ToBo) for creating concise and time-aware visual representations of dynamic scenes. ToBo uses a self-supervised learning pipeline to predict subsequent scenes using minimal patches, encouraging the vision backbone to embed temporal dependencies, and demonstrating superior performance in various sequential tasks and real-world environments....
