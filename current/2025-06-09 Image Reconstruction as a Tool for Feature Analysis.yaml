summary: This study presents a new method to understand how vision encoders represent features by reconstructing images. They tested two model families and found that image-based task trained encoders retain more information than those trained on non-image tasks. Additionally, they discovered that color encoding in these models is controlled by orthogonal rotations, not spatial transformations....
