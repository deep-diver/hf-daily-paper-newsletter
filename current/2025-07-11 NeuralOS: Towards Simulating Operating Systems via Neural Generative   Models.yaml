summary: The study presents NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates operating system GUIs by using an RNN to track computer state and a neural renderer to generate screen images, trained on a large dataset of Ubuntu XFCE interactions. Experiments demonstrate its ability to render realistic GUI sequences and capture mouse interactions, suggesting potential for future adaptive, generative neural interfaces in human-computer interaction systems....
