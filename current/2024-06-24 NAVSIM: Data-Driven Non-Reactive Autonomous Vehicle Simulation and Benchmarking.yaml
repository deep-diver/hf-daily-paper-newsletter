summary: This paper introduces NAVSIM, a middle ground between real and simulated data for evaluating autonomous driving policies. By using large datasets and a non-reactive simulator, NAVSIM allows for large-scale real-world benchmarking and unrolls bird's eye view abstractions of test scenes for a short simulation horizon. This approach enables open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM was used in a competition at C...
