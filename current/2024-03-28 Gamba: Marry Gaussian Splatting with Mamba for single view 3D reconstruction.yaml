summary: This paper introduces Gamba, a fast and efficient 3D reconstruction model that creates 3D assets from single images without lengthy optimization processes or large memory usage. It uses a large number of 3D Gaussians and a Mamba-based sequential network for efficient and context-dependent reasoning, and achieves competitive results on the OmniObject3D dataset....
