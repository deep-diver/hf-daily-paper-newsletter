summary: This paper explores the integration of NeRFs into MLLMs to create LLaNA, the first NeRF-language assistant capable of tasks like NeRF captioning and Q&A. It extracts information from NeRF's MLP weights without rendering images or creating 3D data structures, and it uses a dataset with text annotations for NeRF-language tasks. Results show that processing NeRF weights outperforms extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs....
