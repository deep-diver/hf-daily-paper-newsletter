summary: The paper proposes RoboDual, a dual-system for robotic manipulation that combines the strengths of generalist and specialist policies. It uses a diffusion transformer-based specialist policy for multi-step action rollouts, conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. RoboDual achieves better performance in real-world settings and on the CALVIN benchmark, with a higher control frequency and fewer trainable param...
