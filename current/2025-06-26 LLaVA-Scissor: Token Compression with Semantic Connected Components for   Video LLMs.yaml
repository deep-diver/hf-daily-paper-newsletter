summary: The authors propose a new method called LLaVA-Scissor to compress video data for large language models without the need for additional training. Unlike previous methods, LLaVA-Scissor divides video data into distinct semantic regions, ensuring comprehensive coverage while minimizing redundancy. This approach significantly improves token compression, particularly in low retention scenarios, and outperforms existing methods in various video understanding benchmarks....
