summary: The authors present a new method for unsupervised video instance segmentation that uses real video data only, unlike previous methods that relied on synthetic data. They establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks using deep motion priors, and then use these keymasks to train a segmentation model with a new Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach and Temporal DropLoss, resulting in a model that outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks....
