summary: This paper proposes a novel method for customized text-to-music generation, which can capture the concept from a two-minute reference music and generate a new piece of music conforming to the concept. The method involves fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-music model using the reference music and a Pivotal Parameters Tuning method to address overfitting issues. The paper also introduces a new dataset and evaluation protocol for the new task and presents a concept enhancement strategy to distinguis...
