summary: This paper proposes a new method for pre-training vision models on web-scale image-text data that eliminates the need for pairwise similarity computations in contrastive loss, achieving a remarkable 2.7 times acceleration in training speed compared to contrastive learning on web-scale data. The proposed method maintains high representation quality and is available at <https://github.com/apple/corenet>....
