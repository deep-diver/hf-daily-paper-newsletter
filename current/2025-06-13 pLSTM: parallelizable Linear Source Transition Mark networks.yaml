summary: The authors propose pLSTM, a new type of recurrent neural network that can handle complex data structures like images and molecular graphs by using parallelizable gates on a general DAG. They demonstrate its effectiveness on various tasks and datasets, outperforming Transformers on a synthetic computer vision task....
