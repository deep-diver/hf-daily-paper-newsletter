summary: The research presents a new method called Preference Hijacking (Phi) that can manipulate the output preferences of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using specially crafted images, without altering the models themselves. This technique, which works during inference and is hard to detect, can be used to influence MLLM responses towards any desired preference, as demonstrated by experimental results across various tasks....
