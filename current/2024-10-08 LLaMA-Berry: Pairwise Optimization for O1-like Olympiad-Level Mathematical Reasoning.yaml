summary: LLaMA-Berry is a framework that improves the mathematical reasoning ability of large language models. It uses a pairwise reward model to find better solutions by evaluating different paths globally. This framework has been tested and shown to perform better than existing methods, especially on complex Olympiad-level benchmarks....
