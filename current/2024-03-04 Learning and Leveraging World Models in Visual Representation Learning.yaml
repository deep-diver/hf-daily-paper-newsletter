summary: This paper presents Image World Models (IWMs), a self-supervised approach that predicts global photometric transformations in latent space, which goes beyond masked image modeling. The study shows that IWMs can be adapted through finetuning to solve diverse tasks and can control the abstraction level of the learned representations, matching or surpassing the performance of previous self-supervised methods....
