summary: The study examines the effect of raising inference-time compute in reasoning models (OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini) on their resistance to adversarial attacks. Results indicate that increased inference-time compute improves robustness against various attacks, often leading to zero attack success rate as compute grows. The research also introduces new attacks targeting reasoning models and areas where compute doesn't boost reliability, discussing reasons and potential improvements....
