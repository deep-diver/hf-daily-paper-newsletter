summary: The study presents Mathesis, a pipeline that uses artificial intelligence to convert natural language math problems into formal statements and then proves them. The system, which includes an autoformalizer trained with reinforcement learning, outperforms existing methods on complex math problems, demonstrating its potential for practical applications in formal theorem proving....
