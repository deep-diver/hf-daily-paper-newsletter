summary: The paper proposes a new model called FINECAPTION for compositional image captioning that can recognize arbitrary masks and process high-resolution images at different granularity levels. The model is evaluated on a new dataset called COMPOSITIONCAP, and empirical results show its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art models. The study also highlights areas for improvement in VLM design and training....
