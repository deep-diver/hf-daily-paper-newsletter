summary: A new hybrid digital-analog algorithm for training neural networks is introduced, which is equivalent to natural gradient descent in a certain parameter regime and avoids costly linear system solves. The training occurs in a hybrid digital-analog loop and exploits the thermodynamic properties of an analog system at equilibrium, requiring an analog thermodynamic computer. The algorithm is demonstrated to be superior to state-of-the-art digital first- and second-order training methods on classific...
