summary: This paper introduces a new task called open-vocabulary audio-visual semantic segmentation, which aims to recognize all sounding objects in videos, even those that have never been seen or heard during training. The authors propose a framework called OV-AVSS, which consists of a universal sound source localization module and an open-vocabulary classification module. The framework is evaluated on a new dataset called AVSBench-OV and achieves strong segmentation and zero-shot generalization ability...
