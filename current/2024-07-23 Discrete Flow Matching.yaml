summary: We present Discrete Flow Matching, a new method for generating discrete data like language. It uses a general family of probability paths, learned posteriors, and specific probability paths defined with different schedulers. Our approach is non-autoregressive and can generate high-quality discrete data. By scaling up the model, we improve generative perplexity compared to previous methods and reach 6.7% Pass@1 and 13.4% Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7% Pass@1 and 20.6% Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding...
