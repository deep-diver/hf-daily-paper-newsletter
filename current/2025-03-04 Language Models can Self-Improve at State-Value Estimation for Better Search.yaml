summary: The paper presents a self-supervised method called self-taught lookahead that uses state-transition dynamics to train a value model for language model-controlled search. The method significantly improves performance and reduces costs compared to previous methods, making it a viable alternative to using a frontier LLM like gpt-4o as the value model....
