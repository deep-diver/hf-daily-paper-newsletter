summary: This study challenges the traditional narrow-wide-narrow design of Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and proposes a new wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP block design. The new design inverts the conventional approach by using skip connections at expanded dimensions and narrow bottlenecks, leading to superior performance and more efficient training and inference implementations....
