summary: This study proposes a new encoder, ARC-Encoder, that compresses context into continuous representations for use in large language models, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. The encoder can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, making it a flexible and portable solution for various LLM usage scenarios....
