summary: The authors propose RankNovo, a new framework that enhances peptide sequencing by combining multiple sequencing models and using a novel reranking approach. They also introduce two new metrics to improve peptide sequencing accuracy and demonstrate RankNovo's superior performance and robustness in extensive experiments....
