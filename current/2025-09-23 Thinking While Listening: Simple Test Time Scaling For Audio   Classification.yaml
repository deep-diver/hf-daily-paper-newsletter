summary: 'The authors present a new method to improve audio classification by allowing neural models to ''think'' while listening, similar to how large language models reason. They propose two approaches: incorporating thinking into existing pipelines and designing a new architecture from scratch, both of which enhance classification accuracy. They test this with two open-source reasoning models and find that a simpler method, retraining only the embedding matrix of a smaller model, can outperform larger te...'
