summary: This paper introduces TA-TiTok, an efficient image tokenizer that can use either discrete or continuous 1-dimensional tokens, and MaskGen, a family of text-to-image generative models trained on open data. The goal is to make these models more accessible and democratize the field of text-to-image masked generative models....
