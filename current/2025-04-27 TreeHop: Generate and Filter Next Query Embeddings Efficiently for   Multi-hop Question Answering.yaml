summary: The proposed TreeHop framework efficiently addresses the challenges of multi-hop question answering in RAG systems by replacing LLM-based query rewriting with embedding-level operations, resulting in a significant reduction of computational costs and query latency, while maintaining comparable performance to advanced RAG methods....
