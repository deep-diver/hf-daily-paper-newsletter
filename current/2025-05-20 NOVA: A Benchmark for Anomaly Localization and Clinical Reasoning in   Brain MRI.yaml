summary: NOVA is a new benchmark for testing models' ability to detect and locate rare brain abnormalities in MRI scans, using 281 simulated scans with diverse acquisition protocols. The benchmark evaluates models' performance in anomaly localization, visual captioning, and diagnostic reasoning, revealing significant performance gaps in existing vision-language models....
