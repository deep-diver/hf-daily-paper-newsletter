summary: This paper introduces a method called ReGAL (Refactoring for Generalizable Abstraction Learning) to help large language models learn reusable functions from existing programs and improve their accuracy when predicting new programs, especially in diverse domains. It was tested on three datasets and showed significant improvements over previous models. The abstractions learned by ReGAL capture commonly used subroutines and environment dynamics, making predictions easier....
