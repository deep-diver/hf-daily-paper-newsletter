summary: The authors propose ChronoEdit, a framework that uses video generation to ensure physical consistency in image editing and world simulation tasks. By treating input and edited images as video frames and employing temporal reasoning, ChronoEdit generates plausible editing trajectories, outperforming existing methods in visual quality and physical realism....
