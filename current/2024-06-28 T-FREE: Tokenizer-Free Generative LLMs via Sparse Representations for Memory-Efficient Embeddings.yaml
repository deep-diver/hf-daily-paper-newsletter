summary: T-FREE is a new method for encoding information in Large Language Models that doesn't use tokenizers. It uses sparse activation patterns over character triplets and doesn't need a reference corpus. This method is more efficient and can work better with underrepresented languages, and it can also compress the embedding layers....
