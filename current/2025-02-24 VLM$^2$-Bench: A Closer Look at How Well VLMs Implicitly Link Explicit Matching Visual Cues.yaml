summary: The researchers present VLM^2-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of vision-language models (VLMs) to visually link matching cues. The evaluation across various models reveals a significant performance gap, leading to recommendations for improving models' visual capabilities, establishing clearer principles for language-based reasoning, and shifting training paradigms to enhance models' ability to independently structure and infer visual relationships....
