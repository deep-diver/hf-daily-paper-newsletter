summary: This paper introduces GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The benchmark reveals that LLMs have noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question and their performance declines as the number of clauses in a question increases. The authors hypothesize that this decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their t...
