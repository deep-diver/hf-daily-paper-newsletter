summary: This paper proposes Trajectory Stitching (T-Stitch), a technique to accelerate sampling in pre-trained diffusion models. T-Stitch uses a smaller diffusion model in the initial sampling steps and switches to a larger one at a later stage. This leads to faster sampling with little or no generational degradation. T-Stitch is training-free and can be used with existing fast sampling techniques. It has been tested on various architectures and has shown to be generally applicable....
