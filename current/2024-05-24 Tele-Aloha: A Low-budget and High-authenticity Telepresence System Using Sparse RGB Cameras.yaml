summary: Tele-Aloha is a low-cost telepresence system that uses four sparse RGB cameras, a consumer-grade GPU, and an autostereoscopic screen to achieve high-resolution, real-time, low-latency, and robust communication. It uses a novel view synthesis algorithm and weighted blending mechanism to refine images into a final resolution of 2K, providing a strong three-dimensional sense without the need for a head-mounted display device....
