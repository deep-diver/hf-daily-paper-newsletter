summary: TAPIP3D is a new method for long-term 3D point tracking in videos, which stabilizes videos by using depth and camera motion info to lift 2D features into 3D space, allowing for more accurate tracking over time. It uses a Local Pair Attention mechanism to manage 3D point distribution irregularities and outperforms other 3D tracking methods, even improving 2D tracking accuracy with accurate depth info....
