summary: The paper presents a new method called ProPhy to improve physical consistency in video generation, especially for large-scale or complex dynamics. ProPhy uses a two-stage system to learn detailed physics-based video representations and incorporates physical reasoning capabilities from vision-language models, resulting in more realistic and physically coherent videos....
