summary: The paper proposes an algorithm called GemFilter that uses early layers of a Large Language Model (LLM) to filter and compress input tokens, which significantly reduces the context length for subsequent processing. This method improves speed and memory efficiency compared to existing techniques, and it's simple, training-free, and broadly applicable across different LLMs. It also provides interpretability by allowing humans to inspect the selected input sequence. The code for GemFilter is availa...
