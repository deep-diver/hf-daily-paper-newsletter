summary: This research addresses the challenge of Vision-Language Models struggling with physics-driven reasoning in videos by proposing a method to interpret physical-world context cues. They introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for physics-related comprehension tasks, and MASS, a model-agnostic technique that enhances VLMs with spatial-temporal signals, outperforming prior state-of-the-art models by 8.7% and 6.0%....
