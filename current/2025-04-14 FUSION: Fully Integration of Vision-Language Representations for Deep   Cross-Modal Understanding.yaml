summary: This paper introduces FUSION, a family of multimodal large language models that integrate vision and language throughout the entire processing pipeline, unlike existing methods. The approach involves Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding for pixel-level integration, Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding for fine-grained semantic integration, and Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss for guiding feature mapping. FUSION models were trained at two scales, with FUSION 3B outperforming Cambrian-1 ...
