summary: This paper presents a new training framework called Fuyou that enables efficient training of huge models on a low-end server with a low-end GPU and limited CPU memory capacity. The key idea is to add SSD-CPU communication as an optimization dimension and co-optimize computation and data swapping to maximize GPU utilization. The experimental results show that Fuyou can fine-tune a 175B GPT-3 model on a consumer GPU RTX 4090 with high GPU utilization, while ZeRO-Infinity fails to do so. Additional...
