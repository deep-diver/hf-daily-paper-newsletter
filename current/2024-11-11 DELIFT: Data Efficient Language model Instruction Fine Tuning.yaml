summary: DELIFT is a new algorithm that optimizes data selection during fine-tuning of large language models. It uses a pairwise utility metric to measure the informational value of data samples and selects diverse and optimal subsets for all stages of fine-tuning, reducing data size by up to 70% without compromising performance....
