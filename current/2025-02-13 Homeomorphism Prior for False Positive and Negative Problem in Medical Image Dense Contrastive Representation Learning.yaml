summary: The paper introduces GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning, which embeds the homeomorphism prior to dense contrastive representation learning (DCRL) to enable reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense contrast. It proposes deformable homeomorphism learning (DHL) to model the homeomorphism of medical images and learn to estimate a deformable mapping to predict pixels' correspondence under topological preservation, reducing the searching space of pairing and driving an im...
