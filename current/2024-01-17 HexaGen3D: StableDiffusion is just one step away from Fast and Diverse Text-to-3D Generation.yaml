summary: HexaGen3D is a novel approach that utilizes large, pretrained 2D diffusion models to generate high-quality 3D assets from textual prompts. It fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image model to predict 6 orthographic projections and corresponding latent triplanes, that are then decoded to generate a textured mesh. HexaGen3D offers better quality-to-latency trade-offs, with inference time of 7 seconds, and demonstrates strong generalization to new objects or compositions....
