summary: The study presents AbGen, a new benchmark with 1,500 expert-annotated examples for evaluating large language models' ability to design ablation studies for scientific research. The authors find that leading LLMs, like DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, lag behind human experts in creating accurate and relevant study designs and introduce AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark, to improve LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks....
