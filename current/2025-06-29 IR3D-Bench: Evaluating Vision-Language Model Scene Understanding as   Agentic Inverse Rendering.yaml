summary: The authors present a new benchmark, IR3D-Bench, which tests how well vision-language models can understand scenes by making them actively recreate 3D structures from images using tools, rather than just recognizing them. This 'understanding-by-creating' method evaluates the models' ability to generate accurate 3D representations, focusing on their tool-using capacity and geometric precision....
