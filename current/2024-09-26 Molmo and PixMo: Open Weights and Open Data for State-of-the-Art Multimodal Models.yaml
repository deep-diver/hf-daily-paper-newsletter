summary: Molmo and PixMo are new open-weight and open-data multimodal models that outperform other models in their class and even compare favorably against proprietary systems like GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5. The success of these models relies on a new, highly detailed image caption dataset collected from human annotators, a diverse dataset mixture for fine-tuning, careful model architecture choices, and a well-tuned training pipeline. All of the model weights, data, and source code will be relea...
