summary: The paper presents a new framework called DoGe that helps vision-language models learn more effectively in data-scarce environments. DoGe does this by focusing on problem context, decoupling the learning process, and creating a diverse training data pipeline, which allows the models to generalize better and outperform baseline methods in various benchmarks....
