summary: The authors propose a new neural network architecture called Atlas that uses Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) to improve long context image modeling. They demonstrate significant improvements in compute-performance tradeoff compared to other models, including ConvNext-B, FasterViT, and LongViT, while achieving similar or higher accuracy....
