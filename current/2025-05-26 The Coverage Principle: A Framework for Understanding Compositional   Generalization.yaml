summary: The coverage principle is a framework that explains why language models sometimes fail at compositional generalization, by showing that they rely on pattern matching and cannot generalize beyond certain fragments. The principle also categorizes three ways neural networks can generalize and highlights the need for new architectural or training ideas to achieve systematic compositionality....
