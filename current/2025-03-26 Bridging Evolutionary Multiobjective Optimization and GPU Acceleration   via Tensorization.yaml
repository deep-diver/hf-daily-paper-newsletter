summary: The paper proposes a method to enhance evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms by parallelizing them on GPUs using a tensorization approach. This method transforms EMO algorithms into concise tensor representations, allowing for automatic utilization of GPU computing, resulting in speedups of up to 1113x compared to CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands....
