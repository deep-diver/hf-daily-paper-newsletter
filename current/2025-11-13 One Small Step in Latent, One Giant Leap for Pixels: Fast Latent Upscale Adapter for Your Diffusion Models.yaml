summary: This research proposes a new method called Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA) to improve the resolution of images generated by diffusion models. LUA works by enhancing the model's latent code before the final decoding step, allowing for high-resolution images without the need for additional training or complex modifications, and demonstrates faster processing and comparable quality to existing methods....
