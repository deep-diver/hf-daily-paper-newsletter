summary: The study explores using object-centric representations (OCR) in robotic manipulation, which breaks down visual input into distinct entities. The results show that OCR-based policies generalize better than dense and global representations in various manipulation tasks, even without specific training, highlighting OCR's potential for improving robotic vision in real-world, changing environments....
