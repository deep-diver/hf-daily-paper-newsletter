summary: LoGoPlanner is a new navigation framework for mobile robots that improves upon traditional modular pipelines and previous end-to-end methods. It uses visual-geometry backbone to provide implicit state estimation for accurate localization, reconstructs scene geometry for reliable obstacle avoidance, and conditions the policy on implicit geometry to reduce error propagation. This results in a 27.3% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and envi...
