summary: This paper introduces a system called BASS that uses batched speculative decoding to improve the speed and efficiency of generating multiple language model responses. BASS achieves state-of-the-art latency and a 2.15X speed-up over regular decoding, and generates higher quality sequences within a given time budget....
