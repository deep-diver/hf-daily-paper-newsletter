summary: The paper introduces Neural Directional Encoding (NDE), a method for rendering specular objects in neural radiance fields (NeRF). NDE improves the ability to model high-frequency angular signals and addresses interreflection effects. It outperforms the state of the art on view synthesis of specular objects and allows for fast inference with small networks....
