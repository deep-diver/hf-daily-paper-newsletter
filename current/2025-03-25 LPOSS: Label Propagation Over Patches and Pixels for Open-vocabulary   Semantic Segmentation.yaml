summary: The authors present a training-free method using Vision-Language Models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. They enhance initial per-patch predictions through label propagation, using a Vision Model for better intra-modal similarity and addressing resolution limitations with pixel-level propagation, achieving state-of-the-art results without the need for window-based processing....
