summary: The study presents demonstration-conditioned diffusion models (DemoDiff) for molecular design, which use a small set of molecule-score examples to guide the generation of molecules aligned with target properties. DemoDiff outperforms larger language models and domain-specific approaches in various design tasks, positioning it as a promising foundation model for in-context molecular design....
