summary: The authors propose Rep-MTL, a Multi-Task Learning approach that uses representation-level task saliency to improve interactions between task-specific optimization and shared representation learning. By balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing, Rep-MTL mitigates negative transfer and promotes complementary information sharing, resulting in competitive performance gains on various benchmarks....
