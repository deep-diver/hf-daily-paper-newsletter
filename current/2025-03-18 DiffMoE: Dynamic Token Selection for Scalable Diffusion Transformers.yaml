summary: The proposed method, DiffMoE, enhances diffusion models in image generation tasks by introducing a global token pool and a capacity predictor to dynamically allocate computational resources based on noise levels and sample complexity. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet benchmark and demonstrates its effectiveness in more challenging tasks such as text-to-image generation....
