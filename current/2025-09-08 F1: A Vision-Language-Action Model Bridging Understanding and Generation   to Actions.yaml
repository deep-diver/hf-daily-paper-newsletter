summary: The authors present F1, a pretrained Vision-Language-Action framework that incorporates visual foresight generation into its decision-making process. F1 utilizes a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture and a next-scale prediction mechanism to forecast future visual states, allowing it to generate actions that implicitly achieve visual goals. The model is trained on a large dataset of diverse tasks, resulting in improved performance and generalization ability compared to existing approaches....
