summary: The authors describe TalkingMachines, a system that creates real-time, audio-driven character animations using pretrained video generation models and an audio large language model, enabling natural conversations. They achieve this by adapting a pretrained model, enabling infinite video streaming, and designing a high-throughput inference pipeline with various engineering optimizations....
