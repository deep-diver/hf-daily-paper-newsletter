summary: The authors present a method to improve data efficiency in language model pretraining by modeling and inferring the latent thoughts behind text generation. This method involves treating web text as the condensed result of a detailed thought process, and through data-constrained continued pretraining for math, the authors demonstrate that synthetic data approaches and an EM algorithm for inference scaling and EM iterations significantly outperform baselines trained on raw data....
