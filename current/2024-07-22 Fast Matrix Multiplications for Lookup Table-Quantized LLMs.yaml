summary: This paper introduces FLUTE, a flexible lookup table engine for quantized large language models (LLMs) that optimizes memory usage and reduces the amount of memory movement. The engine uses offline restructuring of the quantized weight matrix and vectorization and duplication of the lookup table to mitigate shared memory bandwidth constraints. It can be 2-4x faster than existing GEMM kernels and is used to quantize LLaMA3 to various configurations, obtaining competitive quantization performance ...
