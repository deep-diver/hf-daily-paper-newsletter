summary: The authors present a new approach to tackling inequality proofs using large language models by dividing them into two subtasks and introducing a new dataset called IneqMath. They evaluate 29 models and find that even the best ones struggle with accuracy when their reasoning is closely examined, suggesting room for improvement in theorem-guided reasoning and self-refinement....
