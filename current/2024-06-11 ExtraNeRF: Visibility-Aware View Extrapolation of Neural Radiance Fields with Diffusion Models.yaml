summary: ExtraNeRF is a method that uses diffusion models and NeRFs to improve the range of views of a NeRF. It focuses on reconstructing unobserved regions and uses two diffusion models to enhance the reconstructed imagery. The method outperforms prior art and can extrapolate beyond a small number of input views....
