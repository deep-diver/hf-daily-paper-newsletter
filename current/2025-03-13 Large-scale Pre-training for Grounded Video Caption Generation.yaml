summary: The authors of this paper present a method to create a large-scale dataset for video caption generation that includes object grounding with dense bounding boxes. They pre-train a model on this dataset, named GROVE, and achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets, including a new iGround dataset with manually annotated captions and grounded bounding boxes....
