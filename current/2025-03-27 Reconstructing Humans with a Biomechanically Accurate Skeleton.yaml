summary: The authors propose a transformer-based model for 3D human reconstruction from single images using a biomechanically accurate skeleton. They tackle the data scarcity issue by creating pseudo ground truth parameters and refining them iteratively. Their model achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks and outperforms others in extreme poses and viewpoints, ensuring realistic joint rotations....
