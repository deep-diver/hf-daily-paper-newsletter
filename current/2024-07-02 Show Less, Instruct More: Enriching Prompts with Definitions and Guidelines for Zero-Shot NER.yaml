summary: The paper introduces SLIMER, an approach for named entity recognition (NER) that improves performance by providing definitions and guidelines to the model, allowing it to learn faster and better, especially when dealing with unseen named entities. It also performs comparably to state-of-the-art approaches in out-of-domain zero-shot NER while being trained on a reduced tag set....
