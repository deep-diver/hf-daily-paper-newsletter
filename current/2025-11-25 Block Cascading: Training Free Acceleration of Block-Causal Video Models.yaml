summary: This study presents a method called Block Cascading that improves the speed of block-causal video models without requiring additional training. By allowing blocks to be generated in parallel, the method significantly increases the speed of both small and large models, and also reduces the time it takes to switch between different parts of the video during interactive generation, all without sacrificing video quality....
