summary: The authors present a method called FFN Fusion that enhances the speed of large language models by optimizing Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. This technique allows for parallel computation, leading to a 1.71X speedup in inference latency and 35X lower per-token cost in the Llama-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-Base model compared to its original version, while maintaining benchmark performance....
