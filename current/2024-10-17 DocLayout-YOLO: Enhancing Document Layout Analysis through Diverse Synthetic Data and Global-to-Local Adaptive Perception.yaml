summary: DocLayout-YOLO is a new method for analyzing document layout that improves accuracy while maintaining speed advantages. It uses a large, diverse dataset called DocSynth-300K for pre-training and a Global-to-Local Controllable Receptive Module for model optimization. It also introduces a new benchmark called DocStructBench for testing performance across different document types. The method is fast and accurate, and the code, data, and models are available online....
