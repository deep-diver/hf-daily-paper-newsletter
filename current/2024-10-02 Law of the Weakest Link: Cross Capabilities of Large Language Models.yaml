summary: The paper introduces CrossEval, a benchmark for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cross-capabilities, which are the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise. The benchmark consists of 1,400 human-annotated prompts and 4,200 model responses, assessed by expert annotators. The findings reveal that current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest c...
