summary: 'The EVOREFUSE approach generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions that consistently trigger confident refusals across large language models (LLMs), improving user experience. It uses an evolutionary algorithm to explore instruction space, creating two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark for evaluating LLM refusals, and EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which helps reduce over-refusals in LLMs without compromising safety....'
