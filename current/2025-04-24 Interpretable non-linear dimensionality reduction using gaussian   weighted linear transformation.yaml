summary: The study presents a new method for reducing data dimensions that combines the strengths of linear and non-linear techniques, allowing for complex transformations while maintaining interpretability. This approach provides powerful dimensionality reduction and transparent insights into the transformed space, with tools to help users understand the geometric relationships preserved and modified during the process....
