summary: The authors present RealSyn, a scalable multimodal dataset designed for vision-language representation learning. RealSyn combines high-quality images and texts, both realistic and synthetic, extracted from unpaired multimodal interleaved documents using a proposed Real-World Data Extraction pipeline and a hierarchical retrieval method. The dataset is available in three scales and has been shown to improve performance on multiple downstream tasks....
