summary: The authors propose a new model called Latent Zoning Network (LZN) that integrates generative modeling, representation learning, and classification by using a shared Gaussian latent space. LZN has shown promising results in improving image generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in representation learning, and successfully performing joint generation and classification tasks....
