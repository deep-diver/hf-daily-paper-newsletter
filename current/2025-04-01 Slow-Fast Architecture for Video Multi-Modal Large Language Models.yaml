summary: The paper proposes a slow-fast architecture to improve video-based multi-modal large language models by balancing temporal resolution and spatial detail. This design employs two types of visual tokens--'fast' compressed features for a quick overview and 'slow' uncompressed features for instruction-aware detail extraction--and achieves state-of-the-art performance with just a 3% increase in computation....
