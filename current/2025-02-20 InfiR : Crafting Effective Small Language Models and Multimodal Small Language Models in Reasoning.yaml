summary: The paper discusses the creation of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) that can reason effectively but with lower computational demands and privacy concerns than Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). A new training pipeline is proposed to improve reasoning abilities and allow deployment on edge devices, achieving top-performance while reducing development costs....
