summary: The authors present a new benchmark called VCRBench to evaluate the video-based causal reasoning abilities of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs). The benchmark uses procedural videos of everyday activities with shuffled steps to test the models' ability to identify, reason, and sequence events for a specific goal. The study finds that LVLMs struggle with this task and introduces a modular approach called RRD to improve performance....
