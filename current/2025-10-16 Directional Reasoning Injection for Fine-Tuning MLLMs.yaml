summary: The authors propose a new method called DRIFT to improve the reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models without requiring resource-intensive training. This method transfers reasoning knowledge in the gradient space, which allows for efficient reasoning transfer while preserving the simplicity of standard supervised fine-tuning pipelines, and has been shown to consistently improve reasoning performance over existing methods....
