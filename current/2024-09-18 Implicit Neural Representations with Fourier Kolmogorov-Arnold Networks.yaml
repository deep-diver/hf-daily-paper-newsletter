summary: The paper introduces a new method called Fourier Kolmogorov Arnold network (FKAN) that uses learnable activation functions modeled as Fourier series to improve the representation of complex signals in implicit neural representations (INRs). This method outperforms existing INR models in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and intersection over union (IoU) for image and 3D occupancy volume representation tasks....
