summary: The authors propose a new strategy called Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD) for improving exploration in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs). EAD dynamically adjusts the sampling temperature during generation, promoting diversity at the start and preserving sample quality towards the end, resulting in more stable training and better performance compared to fixed-temperature sampling....
