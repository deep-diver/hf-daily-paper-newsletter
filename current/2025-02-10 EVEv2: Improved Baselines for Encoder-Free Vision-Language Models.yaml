summary: The authors present EVEv2.0, a new family of encoder-free vision-language models that outperform existing ones and rival mainstream encoder-based models. They demonstrate that properly decomposing and associating vision and language within a unified model reduces interference between modalities and that a well-designed training strategy enables effective optimization for encoder-free VLMs....
