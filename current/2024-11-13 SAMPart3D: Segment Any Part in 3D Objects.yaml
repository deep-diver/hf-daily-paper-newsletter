summary: The paper presents a new method for 3D part segmentation called SAMPart3D. This method uses a text-agnostic vision foundation model to distill a 3D feature extraction backbone and scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features to segment any 3D object into semantic parts at multiple granularities without requiring predefined part label sets. The method can scale to large unlabeled 3D datasets and handle complex, non-ordinary objects. It also addresses the lack of diversity and complexity of objects an...
