summary: This paper introduces two new methods, PositionID Prompting and PositionID Fine-Tuning, to help large language models (LLMs) better control the length of their generated text. The methods involve enhancing the model's ability to continuously monitor and manage text length during generation. Additionally, the paper introduces PositionID CP Prompting to enable LLMs to perform copy and paste operations accurately. The paper also develops two benchmarks for evaluating length control and copy-paste a...
