summary: This study explores how reinforcement learning improves language model planning by comparing policy gradient and Q-learning methods. The research reveals that while RL enhances generalization through exploration, it also faces challenges like diversity collapse in policy gradient, which Q-learning avoids. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the importance of reward design in Q-learning to prevent reward hacking....
