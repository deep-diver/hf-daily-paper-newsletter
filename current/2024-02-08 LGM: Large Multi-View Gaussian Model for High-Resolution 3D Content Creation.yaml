summary: This paper presents a novel framework called Large Multi-View Gaussian Model (LGM) for creating high-resolution 3D objects from text prompts or single-view images. LGM uses a unique method of multi-view Gaussian features and an asymmetric U-Net backbone to generate realistic and detailed 3D models in just 5 seconds, improving on current models' lower resolution output....
