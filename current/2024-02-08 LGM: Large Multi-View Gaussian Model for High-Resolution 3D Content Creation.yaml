summary: This paper presents a novel framework called Large Multi-View Gaussian Model
  (LGM) for creating high-resolution 3D objects from text prompts or single-view images.
  LGM uses a unique method of multi-view Gaussian features and an asymmetric U-Net
  backbone to generate realistic and detailed 3D models in just 5 seconds, improving
  on current models' lower resolution output....
