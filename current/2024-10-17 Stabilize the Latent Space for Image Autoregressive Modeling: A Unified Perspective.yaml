summary: This paper proposes a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image autoregressive modeling. The proposed tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation and outperforms Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), even exhibiting substantial improvement when scaling up model size....
