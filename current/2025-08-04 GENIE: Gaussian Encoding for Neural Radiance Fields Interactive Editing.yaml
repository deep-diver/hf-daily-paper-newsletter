summary: This study presents GENIE, a hybrid model that merges the high-quality rendering of NeRF with the editable structure of GS. GENIE uses trainable feature embeddings for Gaussians, enabling real-time, locality-aware editing and dynamic interaction, making it compatible with physical simulation....
