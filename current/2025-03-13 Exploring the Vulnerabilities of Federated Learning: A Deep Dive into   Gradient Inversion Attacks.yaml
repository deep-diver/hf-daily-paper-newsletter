summary: 'This study provides a comprehensive review and analysis of Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA) in Federated Learning (FL), categorizing them into three types: optimization-based (OP-GIA), generation-based (GEN-GIA), and analytics-based (ANA-GIA). The research reveals that OP-GIA is the most practical attack setting despite its unsatisfactory performance, while GEN-GIA has many dependencies and ANA-GIA is easily detectable, making them both impractical. A three-stage defense pipeline is proposed to ...'
