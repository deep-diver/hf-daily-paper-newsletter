summary: 'The authors present a new framework called CogVLA that improves the efficiency and performance of vision-language-action models by using instruction-driven routing and sparsification. This framework is inspired by human multimodal coordination and has three stages: Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing, and V-L-A Coupled Attention. CogVLA outperforms existing models in terms of success rates and reduces training costs and inference latency....'
