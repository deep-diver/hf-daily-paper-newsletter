summary: The paper presents OREAL, a new RL framework to enhance mathematical reasoning through binary outcome rewards, demonstrating that behavior cloning on positive trajectories from BoN sampling is enough for learning the optimal policy. Additionally, OREAL addresses challenges from sparse rewards by applying a token-level reward model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MATH-500 with a 7B model and 95.0 pass@1 accuracy with a 32B model....
