summary: This paper investigates the impact of model characteristics, such as number of parameters and training methods, on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in self-play conversational games. The study finds a positive correlation between the number of parameters and performance, but also notes a wide range of performance points within a given size bracket. Additionally, the paper highlights the importance of training parameters, such as fine-tuning data quality and method, in determining ...
