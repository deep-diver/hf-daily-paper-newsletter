summary: This paper introduces ROICtrl, a method for improving text-based visual generation models by allowing more control over the position and attributes of multiple instances in an image. It does this by using a new operation called ROI-Unpool, which works with an existing operation called ROI-Align to manipulate high-resolution feature maps for visual generation. ROICtrl is compatible with other methods for improving diffusion models and can be used to extend their applications to multi-instance gen...
