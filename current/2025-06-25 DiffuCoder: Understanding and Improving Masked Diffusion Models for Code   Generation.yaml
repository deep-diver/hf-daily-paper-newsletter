summary: This study explores and enhances the performance of masked diffusion models, specifically for code generation. The researchers trained a 7B model, DiffuCoder, and discovered its unique decoding behavior, which differs from traditional models. They also proposed a new sampling scheme called coupled-GRPO, which improved DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks and reduced the need for autoregressive causality during decoding....
