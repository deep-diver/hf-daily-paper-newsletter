summary: 'This study is the first large-scale analysis of test-time scaling strategies for large language models, covering eight models and four datasets. The main findings are: no single strategy works best for all cases, reasoning models perform differently based on problem difficulty and length, and optimal performance improves with more compute budget for a given model type. The research offers a guide to choosing the best test-time scaling strategy based on problem difficulty, model type, and compute...'
