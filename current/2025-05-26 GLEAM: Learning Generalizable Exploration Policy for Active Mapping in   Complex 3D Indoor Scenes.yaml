summary: The researchers created a new large-scale benchmark called GLEAM-Bench for testing active mapping in complex indoor environments, using 1,152 diverse 3D scenes. They then developed GLEAM, a unified exploration policy, which uses semantic representations, long-term goals, and randomized strategies to outperform existing methods in coverage and accuracy on unseen complex scenes....
