summary: This study presents a new method for creating accurate, physical simulations from real-world robot motion data, which is often hindered by obstructions, noise, and moving objects. The proposed approach combines realistic rendering with explicit object meshes, and uses an optimization pipeline to improve all scene components, enabling high-fidelity object mesh reconstruction, photorealistic views, and robot pose calibration....
