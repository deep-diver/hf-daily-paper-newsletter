summary: The authors present a solution to the challenge of generating long outputs in vision-language models. They build a dataset, LongWriter-V-22k, with long outputs for training, and propose IterDPO, a method that breaks long outputs into smaller segments for optimization due to the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs. The model trained with their method outperforms larger proprietary models on a long-generation benchmark....
