summary: This work presents a diverse inference approach for advanced reasoning tasks, combining multiple models and methods. Test-time simulations, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning with inference feedback improve generalization and performance on International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) combinatorics problems, Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) puzzles, and Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) questions....
