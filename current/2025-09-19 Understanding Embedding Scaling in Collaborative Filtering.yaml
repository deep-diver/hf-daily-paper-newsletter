summary: 'This study investigates the effects of scaling embedding dimensions in recommendation models and finds two new phenomena: double-peak and logarithmic performance curves. The researchers conduct large-scale experiments, analyze the causes of the double-peak phenomenon, and provide a theoretical analysis of noise robustness in collaborative filtering models, offering new insights into scaling recommendation models....'
