summary: The authors present FEAT, a novel Transformer model designed to create high-quality dynamic medical videos by addressing limitations in existing methods, such as insufficient channel interactions, high computational complexity, and coarse denoising guidance. FEAT uses a unified attention mechanism, a linear-complexity design, and a residual value guidance module, resulting in a model that performs as well as or better than state-of-the-art models with fewer parameters and better scalability....
