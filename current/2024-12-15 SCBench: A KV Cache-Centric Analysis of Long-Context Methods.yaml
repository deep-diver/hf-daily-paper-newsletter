summary: SCBench is a benchmark for evaluating long-context methods from a KV cache perspective. It covers four categories of long-context capabilities and evaluates eight categories long-context solutions. The findings show that sparse encoding with O(n) memory and sub-O(n^2) pre-filling computation perform robustly, and dynamic sparsity yields more expressive KV caches than static patterns....
