summary: The paper proposes a framework called ProtoGCD to tackle generalized category discovery, which involves clustering and discovering new categories using labeled old class samples. ProtoGCD addresses challenges in previous methods by using joint prototypes and unified learning objectives for both old and new classes, enabling unified modeling and avoiding biased representations....
