summary: This study compares various test-time scaling strategies for automated theorem proving and proposes two new methods, a dynamic CoT switching mechanism and diverse parallel-scaled RL with trainable prefixes, to reduce computational cost while maintaining performance. The proposed EconProver model achieves comparable performance to baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost....
