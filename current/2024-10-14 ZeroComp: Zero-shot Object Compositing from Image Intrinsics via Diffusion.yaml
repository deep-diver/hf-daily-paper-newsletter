summary: ZeroComp is a method that uses ControlNet and Stable Diffusion to create realistic 3D object composites by adjusting shading, without needing paired images of scenes with and without composite objects during training. It outperforms other methods in quantitative and human perception benchmarks, and even works on real and outdoor images when trained on synthetic indoor data....
