summary: We find that small, low-magnitude, low-frequency components in the initial noise of a denoising pipeline significantly enhance the denoising process, removing the need for guidance and improving inference throughput and memory. We propose a new method, NoiseRefine, that replaces guidance methods with a single refinement of the initial noise, enabling high-quality image generation without guidance within the same diffusion pipeline. Our method uses efficient noise-space learning and achieves stro...
