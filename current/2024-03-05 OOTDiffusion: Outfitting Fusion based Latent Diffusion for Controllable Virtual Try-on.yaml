summary: The paper proposes a new method called OOTDiffusion for virtual try-on, which
  can generate realistic and controllable outfitted images of people wearing different
  clothes. The method uses a pre-trained model and a novel architecture for the denoising
  process, and includes an outfitting UNet and a dropout technique to adjust the strength
  of garment features. The results on two datasets show that OOTDiffusion outperforms
  other methods in both fidelity and controllability....
