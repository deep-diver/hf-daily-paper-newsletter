summary: The paper proposes a new method called OOTDiffusion for virtual try-on, which can generate realistic and controllable outfitted images of people wearing different clothes. The method uses a pre-trained model and a novel architecture for the denoising process, and includes an outfitting UNet and a dropout technique to adjust the strength of garment features. The results on two datasets show that OOTDiffusion outperforms other methods in both fidelity and controllability....
