summary: The authors present TinyLLaVA, a framework for analyzing and designing small-scale Large Multimodal Models. Through experiments, they show that better quality data and training can lead to small LMMs performing as well as larger ones. They train a small LMM, TinyLLaVA-3.1B, which outperforms existing 7B models....
