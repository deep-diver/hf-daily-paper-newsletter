summary: The authors present EBT-Policy, a new energy-based architecture that effectively tackles key problems in robotics and real-world applications. EBT-Policy outperforms existing diffusion-based policies in both simulated and real-world tasks, requiring less computation and converging faster, while also demonstrating new capabilities like zero-shot recovery from failed actions....
