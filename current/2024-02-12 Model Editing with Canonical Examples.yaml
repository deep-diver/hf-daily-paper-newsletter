summary: The paper introduces a method called 'model editing with canonical examples' where a single learning example is provided per desired behavior, evaluation is done out-of-distribution, and the changes from an initial model are limited. The study shows that the method outperforms other fine-tuning methods and improves GPT-J-6B by an inference-time ensemble with changes from sense finetuning of a smaller Backpack....
