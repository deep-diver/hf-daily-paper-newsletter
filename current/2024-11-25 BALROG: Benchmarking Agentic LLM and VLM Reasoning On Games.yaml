summary: The paper presents BALROG, a new benchmark for evaluating the reasoning abilities of large language models and vision language models in complex, dynamic environments. The benchmark includes a range of games with varying levels of difficulty and measures performance using fine-grained metrics. The study finds that current models struggle with more challenging tasks and perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided....
