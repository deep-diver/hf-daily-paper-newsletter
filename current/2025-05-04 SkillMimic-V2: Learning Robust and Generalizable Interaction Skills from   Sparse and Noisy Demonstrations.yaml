summary: The study proposes two data augmentation techniques, Stitched Trajectory Graph and State Transition Field, to address the challenge of learning from sparse and noisy demonstrations in reinforcement learning. These techniques enable robust skill acquisition and significant generalization beyond reference demonstrations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various interaction tasks....
