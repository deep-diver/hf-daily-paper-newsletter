summary: The Convolutional Reconstruction Model (CRM) is a fast, high-fidelity feed-forward generative model that uses a convolutional U-Net and Flexicubes to create a high-resolution, textured 3D mesh from a single image in just 10 seconds, without any test-time optimization. The model leverages the strengths of convolutional layers for pixel-level alignment and strong bandwidth to generate a high-quality mesh from sparse 3D data....
