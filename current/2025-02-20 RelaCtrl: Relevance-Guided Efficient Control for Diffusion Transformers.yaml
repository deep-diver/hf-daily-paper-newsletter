title: 'RelaCtrl: Relevance-Guided Efficient Control for Diffusion Transformers'
thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.14377
summary: The paper introduces RelaCtrl, a framework that optimizes the integration of control signals into diffusion transformers by assessing the relevance of each layer to control information and tailoring the positioning, parameter scale, and modeling capacity of the control layers. Additionally, it replaces self-attention and FFN in copy blocks with a Two-Dimensional Shuffle Mixer for efficient implementation of token and channel mixers....
