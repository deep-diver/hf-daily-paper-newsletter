summary: This paper introduces FAN, a novel network architecture based on Fourier Analysis that can model and reason about periodic phenomena more accurately than traditional neural networks. FAN can replace multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in various models with fewer parameters and computational resources, and it performs well in tasks like symbolic formula representation, time series forecasting, and language modeling....
