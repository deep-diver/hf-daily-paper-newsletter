summary: 'We present FAM Diffusion, a method that enhances the performance of pre-existing diffusion models by introducing two modules: Frequency Modulation (FM) and Attention Modulation (AM). FM improves the global structure consistency, while AM addresses local texture inconsistencies. Our approach seamlessly integrates into any latent diffusion model without requiring additional training. It outperforms previous methods in addressing structural and local artifacts, and has negligible latency overheads....'
