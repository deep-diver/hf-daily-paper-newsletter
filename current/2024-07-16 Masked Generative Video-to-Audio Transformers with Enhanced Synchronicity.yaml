summary: The paper introduces MaskVAT, a video-to-audio generative model that combines a high-quality audio codec with a sequence-to-sequence masked generative model to achieve high audio quality, semantic matching, and temporal synchronization. The results show that MaskVAT is highly synchronized and competitive with the state of the art of non-codec generative audio models....
