summary: A method called Code Iteration (CodeIt) is introduced to improve language models on tasks that require human-level reasoning. CodeIt iterates between program sampling and hindsight relabeling, and learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the goal of an episode, CodeIt successfully addresses the sparsity of rewards in program synthesis and achieves inter-task generalization. CodeIt outperforms existing neural and symbolic baselines on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) e...
