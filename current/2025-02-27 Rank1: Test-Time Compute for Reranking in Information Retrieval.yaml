summary: The paper presents Rank1, a reranking model trained for utilizing test-time compute to enhance performance. Rank1 leverages a reasoning language model for distillation, improving the performance of a smaller model rapidly. The model is trained on a dataset of over 600,000 R1 reasoning traces, showcasing state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning datasets, strong out-of-distribution performance, and explainable reasoning chains. Quantized versions of Rank1 models also retain strong perfor...
