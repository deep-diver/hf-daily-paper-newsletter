summary: This work investigates techniques for improving code generation in low-resource programming languages using Large Language Models. The study compares classic fine-tuning, in-context learning with various prompts, and a pre-training objective for translation between high- and low-resource languages, using R and Racket as examples and six LLMs of different architectures and sizes....
