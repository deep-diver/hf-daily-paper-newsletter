summary: The authors present HyperVL, a multimodal large language model designed for on-device use, which overcomes the high computational and memory requirements of current models through an image-tiling strategy, a Visual Resolution Compressor, and Dual Consistency Learning. HyperVL outperforms similar-sized models in various benchmarks and reduces latency and power consumption on mobile devices, making it practical for on-device multimodal inference....
