summary: The researchers present a new method called Reservoir SWD (ReSWD) that improves the Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) by reducing its high variance, which leads to more stable gradients and faster convergence. They achieve this by incorporating Weighted Reservoir Sampling, and their method is shown to outperform standard SWD and other variance reduction techniques in various tasks, from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications like color correction and diffusion guidance....
