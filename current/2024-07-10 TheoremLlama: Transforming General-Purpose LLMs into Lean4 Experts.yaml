summary: This paper introduces TheoremLlama, a framework that trains a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert in formal theorem proving. It includes methods for generating aligned NL-FL datasets, training the LLM, and writing formal proofs. The framework achieves better results than GPT-4 on MiniF2F datasets and the authors have made their model and dataset publicly available....
