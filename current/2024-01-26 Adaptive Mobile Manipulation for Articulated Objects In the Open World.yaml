summary: A new robot system called Open-World Mobile Manipulation System is introduced that can safely and autonomously adapt to operate on articulated objects, like doors and drawers, in unstructured environments such as homes. The robot uses behavior cloning and online practice to learn from a small set of data and improve success rates from 50% to 95% in less than an hour of online learning for each object. The system costs around 20,000 USD and was tested with 20 articulated objects across 4 building...
