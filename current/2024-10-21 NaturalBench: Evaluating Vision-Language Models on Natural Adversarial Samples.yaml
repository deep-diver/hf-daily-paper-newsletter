summary: Despite recent progress, vision-language models still struggle with natural images and questions that humans can easily answer, known as natural adversarial samples. A new benchmark, NaturalBench, has been introduced to reliably evaluate these models, which are found to lag behind human performance by 50%-70%. NaturalBench is more challenging than previous benchmarks due to its vision-centric design and requires diverse visio-linguistic skills to solve, including understanding attribute bindings...
