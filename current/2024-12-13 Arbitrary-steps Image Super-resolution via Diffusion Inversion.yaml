summary: This study introduces a new image super-resolution technique called Diffusion Inversion, which uses large pre-trained models to improve image quality. The method involves a Partial noise Prediction strategy and a deep noise predictor to estimate noise maps for the forward diffusion process. This method offers flexible and efficient sampling, supporting an arbitrary number of steps, and even with one step, it performs as well as or better than current state-of-the-art approaches. The code and mod...
