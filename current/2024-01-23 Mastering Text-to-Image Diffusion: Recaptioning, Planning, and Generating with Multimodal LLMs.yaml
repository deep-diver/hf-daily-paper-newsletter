summary: This paper proposes a new text-to-image generation/editing framework called RPG that harnesses the chain-of-thought reasoning of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image diffusion models. RPG breaks down the process of generating complex images into simpler subregion generation tasks, and employs complementary regional diffusion for compositional generation. Experiments show that RPG outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in multi-category object composition an...
