summary: The authors present Fast-FoundationStereo, a new architecture that provides strong generalization for real-time stereo matching, overcoming the trade-off between speed and robustness in existing models. They use techniques like knowledge distillation, blockwise neural architecture search, and structured pruning to achieve this, resulting in a model that is 10 times faster than the previous state-of-the-art while maintaining similar accuracy....
