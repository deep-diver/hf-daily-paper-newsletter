summary: The study presents TempFlow-GRPO, a new framework for text-to-image generation that addresses the issue of inefficient reward-based optimization in existing models. By introducing a trajectory branching mechanism and a noise-aware weighting scheme, TempFlow-GRPO improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences and outperforms existing models in standard text-to-image benchmarks....
