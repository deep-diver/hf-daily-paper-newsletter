summary: This paper proposes BeyondScene, a framework that generates higher-resolution human-centric scenes with exceptional text-image correspondence and naturalness using existing pretrained diffusion models. BeyondScene employs a staged and hierarchical approach to generate a detailed base image and then seamlessly convert it to a higher-resolution output, surpassing existing methods in terms of correspondence with detailed text descriptions and naturalness....
