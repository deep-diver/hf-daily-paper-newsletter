summary: This paper proposes a method called GaussianPro which improves the quality
  of 3D Gaussian splatting, a technique used for real-time rendering, by using a progressive
  propagation strategy to guide the creation of new 3D Gaussians from the existing
  reconstructed geometry of the scene....
