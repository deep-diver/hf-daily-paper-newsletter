summary: The Psi-Sampler framework uses an SMC-based method with a new algorithm called pCNL to improve sampling efficiency in reward alignment tasks for score-based generative models. By initializing particles from the reward-aware posterior and using pCNL for high-dimensional posterior sampling, this method outperforms existing methods in various tasks like layout-to-image generation and aesthetic-preference generation....
