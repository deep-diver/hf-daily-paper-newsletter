summary: TikZero is designed to solve the issue of synthesizing figures from text captions with high precision and editability by using graphics programs in languages like TikZ, even when aligned training data is scarce. It uses unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images as data sources and enables zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference, outperforming baseline methods and matching or exceeding the performance of larger models....
