summary: The paper introduces a new framework and optimization strategy for high-resolution large multimodal models, focusing on reducing computational expenses and improving performance. The method, called SliME, uses a mixture of adapters to extract contextual information from the global view and introduces learnable query embeddings to reduce image tokens, selecting the most important tokens based on user questions. The training strategy is also optimized for balanced learning between global and local...
