summary: DITTO-2 is a new method that speeds up music generation by distilling a pre-trained diffusion model for fast sampling, performing inference-time optimization, and running a final multi-step sampling generation. It improves control adherence and generation quality while being faster than real-time, and can also be used to maximize text adherence in music generation....
