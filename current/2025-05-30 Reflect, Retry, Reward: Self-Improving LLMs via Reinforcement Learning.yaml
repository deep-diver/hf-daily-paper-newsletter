summary: This study presents a new method to enhance large language models by making them self-reflect and learn from mistakes using reinforcement learning. The model generates a self-reflective commentary after failing a task, and if it succeeds on the second attempt, the self-reflection is rewarded. This approach led to significant performance improvements across various tasks and model architectures, with smaller fine-tuned models even outperforming larger ones....
