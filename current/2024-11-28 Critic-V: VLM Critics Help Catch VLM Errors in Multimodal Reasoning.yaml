summary: Critic-V is a new method that helps vision-language models (VLMs) improve their accuracy and efficiency in complex reasoning tasks. It does this by using a critic model that provides constructive feedback to the reasoning process. The critic model is trained using preference data and offers natural language critiques instead of just numbers. This helps the reasoning process become more reliable and context-sensitive. Critic-V outperforms other methods on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, making it a promis...
