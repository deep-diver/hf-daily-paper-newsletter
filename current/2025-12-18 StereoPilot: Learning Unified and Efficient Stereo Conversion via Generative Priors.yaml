summary: This study presents a new method called StereoPilot that efficiently creates 3D videos by directly synthesizing the target view, avoiding the need for separate depth maps or complex multi-stage processes. The method is trained using a large-scale unified dataset called UniStereo, which covers both stereo formats, and it outperforms existing techniques in terms of visual quality and computational efficiency....
