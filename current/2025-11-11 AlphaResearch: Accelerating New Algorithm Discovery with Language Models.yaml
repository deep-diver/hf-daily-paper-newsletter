summary: The authors propose AlphaResearch, an agent that discovers new algorithms on open-ended problems by combining an execution-based verification environment with a simulated peer review process. AlphaResearch competes with human researchers and achieves a 2/8 win rate, with its solution to the 'packing circles' problem outperforming previous results....
