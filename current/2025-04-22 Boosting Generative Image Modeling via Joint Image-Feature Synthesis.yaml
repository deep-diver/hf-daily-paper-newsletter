summary: The study presents a new framework for image generation that combines low-level image details with high-level semantic features, improving both the quality and efficiency of the generative process. This approach simplifies training and introduces a new inference strategy that uses learned semantics to enhance image generation, resulting in better image quality and faster convergence....
