summary: Delta-IRIS, a new agent with a world model architecture, sets a new state of the art in the Crafter benchmark while being faster to train than previous attention-based approaches. The architecture uses a discrete autoencoder to encode stochastic deltas between time steps and an autoregressive transformer to predict future deltas by summarizing the current state of the world with continuous tokens. The code and models are available at https://github.com/vmicheli/delta-iris....
