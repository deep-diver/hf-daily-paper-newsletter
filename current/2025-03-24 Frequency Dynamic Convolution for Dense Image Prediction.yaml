summary: The paper presents Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDConv), an innovative method for image prediction that addresses the limitations of Dynamic Convolution by learning a fixed parameter budget in the Fourier domain, dividing it into frequency-based groups, and constructing frequency-diverse weights. The approach includes Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM) and Frequency Band Modulation (FBM) for enhanced adaptability and better performance than previous methods while maintaining a modest increase in ...
