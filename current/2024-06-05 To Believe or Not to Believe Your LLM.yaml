summary: The paper discusses uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) and introduces an information-theoretic metric to reliably detect when only epistemic uncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. This metric can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtained by special iterative prompting based on previous responses. The paper also conducts experiments demonstrating the advantage of the proposed formulation and sheds light on how probabil...
