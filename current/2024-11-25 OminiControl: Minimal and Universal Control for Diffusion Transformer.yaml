summary: The paper presents OminiControl, a simple and efficient method for integrating image conditions into pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. This framework uses a parameter reuse mechanism to encode image conditions with only a small amount of additional parameters and can handle a variety of image conditioning tasks. It outperforms existing methods in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation, and the authors release a training dataset called Subjects200K to advan...
