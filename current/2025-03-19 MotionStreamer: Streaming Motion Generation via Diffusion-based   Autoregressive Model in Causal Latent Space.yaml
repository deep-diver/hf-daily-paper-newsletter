summary: The authors present MotionStreamer, a new method for generating human motion in real-time, addressing the limitations of current approaches like diffusion models and GPT-based methods. MotionStreamer utilizes a continuous causal latent space in a probabilistic autoregressive model, reducing error accumulation and information loss, and outperforming existing methods in various applications like multi-round generation, long-term generation, and dynamic motion composition....
