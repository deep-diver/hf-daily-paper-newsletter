summary: The paper presents Adaptive Parallel Encoding (APE), which improves the efficiency and scalability of context-augmented generation by addressing issues in parallel encoding, such as misalignments in attention distribution. APE brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align parallel encoding with sequential encoding, leading to significant performance improvements and speedups in RAG and ICL tasks....
