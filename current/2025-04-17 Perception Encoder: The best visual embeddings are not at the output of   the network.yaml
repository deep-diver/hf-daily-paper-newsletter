summary: The authors propose a novel vision encoder called Perception Encoder (PE) that uses contrastive vision-language training for image and video understanding. They find that the most effective embeddings are found within the intermediate layers of the network, and introduce language and spatial alignment methods to extract them, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks....
