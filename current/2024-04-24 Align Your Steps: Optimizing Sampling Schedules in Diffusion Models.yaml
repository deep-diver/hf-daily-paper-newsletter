summary: This paper proposes a new approach to optimize the sampling schedules of diffusion models for high-quality outputs, called Align Your Steps. The method uses stochastic calculus to find optimal schedules specific to different solvers, trained models and datasets. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that the optimized schedules outperform previous hand-crafted schedules in almost all experiments, demonstrating the potential of schedule optimization....
