summary: The paper presents PhysDreamer, an approach that uses video generation models to endow static 3D objects with interactive dynamics by distilling object dynamics priors, enabling the synthesis of realistic object responses to novel interactions. This leads to more engaging and realistic virtual experiences by enabling static 3D objects to dynamically respond to interactive stimuli in a physically plausible manner....
