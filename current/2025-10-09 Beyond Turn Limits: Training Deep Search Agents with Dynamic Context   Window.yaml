summary: The authors present DeepMiner, a new framework that enhances deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents by generating complex training tasks and implementing a dynamic context window. DeepMiner-32B, developed using this framework, significantly outperforms previous open-source agents in various search agent benchmarks, including BrowseComp-en, while effectively managing long-horizon contexts....
