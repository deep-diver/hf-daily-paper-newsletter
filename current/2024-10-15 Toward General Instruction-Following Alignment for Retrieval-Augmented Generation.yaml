summary: The paper introduces VIF-RAG, an automated and scalable synthetic pipeline for instruction-following alignment in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It also introduces FollowRAG Benchmark, a test set for evaluating RAG systems' instruction-following abilities. The paper demonstrates that VIF-RAG improves the performance of RAG systems across a range of general instruction constraints....
