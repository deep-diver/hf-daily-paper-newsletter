summary: This paper presents a text-to-3D 360° scene generation pipeline that utilizes a 2D diffusion model and prompt self-refinement to create a high-quality panoramic image, which is then lifted into 3D Gaussians for real-time exploration. The pipeline constructs a spatially coherent structure by aligning the 2D monocular depth into a globally optimized point cloud and imposes semantic and geometric constraints to address invisible issues. The result is a globally consistent 3D scene within a 360° p...
