summary: This paper proposes a hybrid approach that maintains both a mesh and a Signed Distance Field representation for shape generation. It introduces MagicClay, an artist-friendly tool for sculpting meshes according to textual prompts while keeping other regions untouched. The framework balances consistency and regularizations in shape optimization, and the mesh representation allows for faster and higher resolution rendering of the SDF....
