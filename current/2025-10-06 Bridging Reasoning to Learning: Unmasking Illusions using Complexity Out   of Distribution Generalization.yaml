summary: The authors propose a new framework called Complexity Out of Distribution (Complexity OoD) generalization to define and measure reasoning in AI models. This framework helps distinguish between tasks that can be solved with simple processing and those that require more complex, step-by-step reasoning, and provides recommendations for improving reasoning abilities in AI models....
