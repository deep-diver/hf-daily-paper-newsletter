summary: The study introduces a method that uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning in an iterative manner to help large vision-language models (LVLMs) improve reasoning skills. This method, applied to the OpenVLThinker model, results in better performance on challenging multimodal reasoning tasks such as MathVista, MathVerse, and MathVision....
