summary: 'The study identifies and solves three main problems in creating long, controllable videos: inconsistent noise initialization, unaligned control signals, and limitations of single-modality guidance. The proposed LongVie framework addresses these issues through a unified noise initialization strategy, global control signal normalization, a multi-modal control framework, and a degradation-aware training strategy, resulting in high-quality, long videos with improved controllability and consistency....'
