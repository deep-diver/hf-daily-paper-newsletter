summary: The study creates a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks to assess the capabilities of state-of-the-art retrieval models, which struggle to provide high-quality results even for the best models. The research also examines the effect of using large language models (LLMs) for query expansion and rewriting, finding that while LLMs can help weaker models, the strongest model sees reduced performance with all rewriting techniques....
