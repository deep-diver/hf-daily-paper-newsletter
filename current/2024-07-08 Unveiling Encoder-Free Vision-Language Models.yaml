summary: This paper presents a simple yet effective training recipe for encoder-free vision-language models, which can be trained and forwarded efficiently. The model, called EVE, can rival encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks, and outperforms a counterpart model with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. The authors believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing a pure decoder-only architecture across moda...
