summary: The study presents evidence that large language models can develop new skills through reinforcement learning by combining existing ones, similar to human cognitive skill acquisition. The research introduces a new framework to investigate this, demonstrating that RL enables models to learn unseen compositions of functions and even transfer this ability to different tasks, whereas next-token training does not produce these results....
