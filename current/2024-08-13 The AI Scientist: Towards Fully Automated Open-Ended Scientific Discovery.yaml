summary: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for fully automated scientific discovery using frontier large language models. The AI Scientist generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, writes scientific papers, and runs a simulated review process for evaluation. It demonstrates versatility by applying to three subfields of machine learning and can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by an a...
