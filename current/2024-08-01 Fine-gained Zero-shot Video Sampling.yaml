summary: We present a new method called ZS^2 that generates high-quality video clips from existing image synthesis methods without any training or optimization. It uses dependency noise model and temporal momentum attention to ensure content consistency and animation coherence. This makes it good for tasks like conditional and context-specialized video generation and instruction-guided video editing. It's the best at zero-shot video generation and sometimes even better than trained methods....
