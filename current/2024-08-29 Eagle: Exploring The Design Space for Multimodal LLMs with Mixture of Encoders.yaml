summary: This study explores the design space for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using a mixture of vision encoders. It reveals several underlying principles and introduces a new approach called Pre-Alignment to enhance model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, outperforms other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks....
