summary: This research investigates the impact of low-bit quantization on Qwen3, an advanced open-source Large Language Model, by evaluating five post-training quantization techniques across various bit-widths and datasets. The study finds that while Qwen3 performs well at moderate bit-widths, it struggles with ultra-low precision, highlighting the need for further research to improve quantization methods for LLMs....
