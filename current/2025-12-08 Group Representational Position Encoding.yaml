summary: 'GRAPE is a unified framework for positional encoding that combines two mechanisms: Multiplicative GRAPE, which uses multiplicative rotations in SO(d), and Additive GRAPE, which uses additive logit biases from unipotent actions in GL. This framework provides a structured way to design positional geometry for long-context models, encompassing RoPE and ALiBi as special cases....'
