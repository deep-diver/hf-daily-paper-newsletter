summary: The researchers created a new system called MIND-V that can generate realistic and logical videos of robots performing complex tasks over long periods. MIND-V uses a three-part approach to plan tasks, translate instructions, and render videos, and it's trained to obey physical laws to ensure the generated actions are possible in the real world....
