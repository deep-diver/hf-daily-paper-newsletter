summary: The paper proposes a new metric called Attention-IoU to expose biases within a model's internal representations using attention maps, instead of just analyzing dataset distribution and model performance on subgroups. The Attention-IoU metric is validated on the Waterbirds dataset and then applied to the CelebA dataset to uncover correlations beyond accuracy disparities, revealing how biases are represented in the dataset, and identifying potential confounding variables....
