summary: This paper proposes a multi-agent classroom simulation framework called SimClass, which uses large language models (LLMs) to simulate classroom interaction patterns and improve user experience. The framework recognizes class roles and introduces a class control mechanism for automatic teaching. The authors conduct user experiments in two real-world courses and observe emergent group behaviors among agents, which can enhance the learning process....
