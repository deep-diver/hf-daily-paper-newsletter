summary: This study examines the performance of language models, specifically o1-mini and o3-mini, in mathematical reasoning using chain-of-thought. The results show that o3-mini (m) outperforms o1-mini without requiring longer reasoning chains, and that accuracy generally decreases with longer chains. The findings suggest that newer models use test-time compute more effectively and provide insights into the relationship between model capability and reasoning length....
