summary: The PathoHR pipeline enhances pathological images to improve breast cancer survival prediction, using a high-resolution ViT for patch-wise WSI representation, optimizing feature extraction with advanced similarity metrics, and demonstrating that smaller enhanced patches can achieve equivalent or superior prediction accuracy compared to raw larger patches, reducing computational overhead....
