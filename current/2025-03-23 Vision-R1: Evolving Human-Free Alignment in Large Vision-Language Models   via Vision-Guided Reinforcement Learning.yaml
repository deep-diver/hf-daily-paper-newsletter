summary: The paper introduces Vision-R1, a new reinforcement learning algorithm that trains large vision-language models using vision feedback instead of human-annotated data or reward models. Vision-R1 uses a criterion-driven reward function and a progressive rule refinement strategy to improve model performance and avoid reward hacking, achieving up to 50% improvement over a larger model....
