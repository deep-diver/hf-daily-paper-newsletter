summary: This paper proposes a new metric called 'capacity density' to evaluate the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on their effectiveness and efficiency. The paper also identifies an empirical law, the 'densing law', which states that the capacity density of LLMs is increasing exponentially over time, doubling approximately every three months. This law can guide future LLM development by emphasizing the importance of improving capacity density to achieve optimal results with minimal comput...
