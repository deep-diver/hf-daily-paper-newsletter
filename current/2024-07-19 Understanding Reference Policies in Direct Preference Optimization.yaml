summary: This paper explores the impact of reference policies in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a method used to improve large language models. The authors find that the strength of the KL-divergence constraint and the similarity between the reference policy and the model being fine-tuned can affect DPO's effectiveness. They also demonstrate that DPO outperforms related learning objectives without a reference policy, and that a stronger reference policy can lead to improved performance when it is ...
