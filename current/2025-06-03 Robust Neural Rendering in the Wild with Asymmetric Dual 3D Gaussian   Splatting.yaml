summary: The authors present a new framework called Asymmetric Dual 3DGS that creates more stable and consistent 3D reconstructions from challenging in-the-wild images by leveraging the randomness of visual artifacts. This method uses two parallel 3D Gaussian Splatting models with a consistency constraint and a divergent masking strategy to reduce shared error modes, and a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy to improve training efficiency....
