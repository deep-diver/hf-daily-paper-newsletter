summary: This paper presents Hash3D, a method that accelerates 3D generation without requiring training. It does this by efficiently reusing feature maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, reducing redundant computations and improving the smoothness of synthesized 3D objects. Hash3D can speed up 3D generation tasks by 1.3 to 4 times and significantly reduce the processing time for text-to-3D and image-to-3D conversions....
