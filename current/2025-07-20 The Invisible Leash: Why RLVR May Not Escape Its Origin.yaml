summary: This study explores the limitations of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) in enhancing AI's reasoning abilities, suggesting that it may not truly expand a model's reasoning boundary but instead amplifies high-reward outputs the base model already knows. The research identifies an entropy-reward tradeoff, where RLVR improves precision but may narrow exploration and overlook correct solutions, ultimately revealing potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons....
