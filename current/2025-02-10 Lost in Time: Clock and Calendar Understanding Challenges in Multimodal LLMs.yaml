summary: 'The paper explores the ability of multimodal large language models to understand time and date from visual representations such as analogue clocks and yearly calendars. The authors created a dataset with two parts: ClockQA for different types of clock styles and CalendarQA with questions about commonly known dates and computationally derived dates. The study reveals that, despite progress, accurately understanding time is still a challenge for these models....'
