summary: FoNE is a new method to represent numbers in Large Language Models as single tokens using only two embedding dimensions per digit, inspired by the models' internal learning of Fourier-like features. Compared to traditional subword and digit-wise embeddings, FoNE accelerates training and inference, reduces computational overhead, and achieves higher accuracy across numerical tasks like addition, subtraction, and multiplication....
