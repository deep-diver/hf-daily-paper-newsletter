summary: This study investigates the alignment of 3D and text latent spaces, discovering that projecting learned representations onto well-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces significantly improves the quality of alignment, leading to better performance on matching and retrieval tasks. The analysis of these shared subspaces reveals they roughly separate between semantic and geometric data representations....
