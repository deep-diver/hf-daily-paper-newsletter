summary: This paper introduces AudioSeal, a new technique for watermarking audio to detect AI-generated speech. It is the first technique specifically designed for localized detection, can detect watermarks up to the sample level, and has better imperceptibility than existing techniques. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of robustness to real-life audio manipulations and is faster than existing models, making it ideal for large-scale and real-time applications....
