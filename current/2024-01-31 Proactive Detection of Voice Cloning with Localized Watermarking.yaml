summary: This paper introduces AudioSeal, a new technique for watermarking audio to
  detect AI-generated speech. It is the first technique specifically designed for
  localized detection, can detect watermarks up to the sample level, and has better
  imperceptibility than existing techniques. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance
  in terms of robustness to real-life audio manipulations and is faster than existing
  models, making it ideal for large-scale and real-time applications....
