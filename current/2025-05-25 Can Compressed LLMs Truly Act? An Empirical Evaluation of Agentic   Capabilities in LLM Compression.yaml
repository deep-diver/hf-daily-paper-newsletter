summary: This research presents a new benchmark, ACBench, to evaluate the impact of compression on the agentic abilities of large language models. The study reveals that while 4-bit quantization minimally affects workflow generation and tool use, it significantly reduces real-world application accuracy, and introduces new methods for analyzing these tradeoffs....
