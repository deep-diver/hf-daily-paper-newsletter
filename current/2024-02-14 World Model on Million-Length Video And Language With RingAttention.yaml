summary: This paper describes the development of a large dataset of diverse videos and books, which uses the RingAttention technique to scalably train on long sequences. The resulting models have been optimized for training on millions-length multimodal sequences and can process long text documents and videos, setting new benchmarks in difficult retrieval tasks and long video understanding....
