summary: This research proposes a new pruning method called Optimal Brain Apoptosis (OBA) for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. Instead of approximations, OBA directly calculates the Hessian-vector product value for each parameter, allowing for a more precise pruning process and enhanced computational efficiency without compromising performance....
