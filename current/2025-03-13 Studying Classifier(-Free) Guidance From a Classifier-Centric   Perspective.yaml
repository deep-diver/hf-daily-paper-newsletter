summary: This study offers a new perspective on classifier-free guidance for conditional generation using denoising diffusion models, focusing on the role of the classifier. It shows that both classifier and classifier-free guidance push the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, and proposes a generic postprocessing step based on flow-matching to improve the pre-trained denoising diffusion model's distribution alignment with the real data distribution, particularly around decisi...
