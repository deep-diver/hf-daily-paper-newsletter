summary: This research explores semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation, where source and target domains have different feature representations and distributions. By conducting experiments on various methods, it uncovers that noise drawn from simple distributions can contain transferable knowledge, and knowledge transfer mainly comes from the transferability and discriminability of the source domain....
