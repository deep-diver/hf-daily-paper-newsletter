summary: Researchers have developed a new method to represent videos as Trajectory Fields, which map each pixel's continuous 3D movement over time. They also introduced a neural network, Trace Anything, that predicts these trajectories in one go, offering improved efficiency and new capabilities like motion forecasting, all while setting a new standard for trajectory field estimation....
