summary: The paper presents a new method called Motion2Motion that transfers animations between characters with different skeletal structures, using only one or a few example motions and a small set of bone correspondences. Motion2Motion is effective in both similar and dissimilar skeleton transfer scenarios, and its practical utility is demonstrated through successful integration in downstream applications and user interfaces....
