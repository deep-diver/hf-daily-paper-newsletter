summary: The paper introduces Denoising LM (DLM), a scaled error correction model trained with synthetic data to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. DLM uses text-to-speech (TTS) systems to generate noisy hypotheses, which are then paired with the original texts to train the model. DLM has several key ingredients, including up-scaled model and data, multi-speaker TTS systems, noise augmentation strategies, and new decoding techniques. With a Transformer-CTC ASR, DLM achieves state-of-the-...
