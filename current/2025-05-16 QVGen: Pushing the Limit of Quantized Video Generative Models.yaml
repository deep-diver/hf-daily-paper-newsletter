summary: The authors present QVGen, a new training framework for efficient video generation models that can run on low-bit quantization, addressing the high computational demands of current video diffusion models. They use a theoretical analysis and auxiliary modules to improve training, and a rank-decay strategy to eliminate inference overhead, resulting in significant performance improvements compared to existing methods....
