summary: 'The paper presents a new method called RobustSplat to improve 3D rendering by addressing the issue of artifacts caused by transient objects. It does this through two key designs: a strategy to delay Gaussian growth and a mask bootstrapping approach that uses lower-resolution feature similarity for initial transient mask estimation before moving to high-resolution supervision. This results in more accurate and robust 3D renderings, as shown in experiments on challenging datasets....'
