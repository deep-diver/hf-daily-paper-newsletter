summary: This paper presents a method for separating the different components of an image, such as surface reflectance and lighting effects, even in complex, real-world scenarios. By breaking down the problem into simpler sub-problems, they are able to estimate the lighting effects in images, which can be used for various image editing applications such as removing specular highlights and adjusting white balance....
