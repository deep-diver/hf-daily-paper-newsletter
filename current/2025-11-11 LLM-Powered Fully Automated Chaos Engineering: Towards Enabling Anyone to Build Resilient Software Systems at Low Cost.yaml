summary: The researchers present ChaosEater, a system that uses Large Language Models to automate the entire process of Chaos Engineering, making it easier and cheaper for anyone to build resilient software systems, specifically those built on Kubernetes. They tested ChaosEater on small and large-scale Kubernetes systems and found that it completes reasonable Chaos Engineering cycles with significantly lower time and cost, and its cycles are validated by both human engineers and LLMs....
