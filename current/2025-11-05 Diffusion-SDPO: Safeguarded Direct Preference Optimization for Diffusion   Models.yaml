summary: The study presents Diffusion-SDPO, a new method for improving the alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences. Diffusion-SDPO addresses the issue of increasing reconstruction error in both preferred and less-preferred outputs by adapting the loss function to preserve the quality of the preferred output while still improving the less-preferred one....
