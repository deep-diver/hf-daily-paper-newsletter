summary: This paper presents 3DGStream, a method for efficient streaming of photo-realistic
  Free-Viewpoint Videos of real-world dynamic scenes. It uses 3D Gaussians to represent
  the scene and a Neural Transformation Cache for fast on-the-fly per-frame reconstruction
  and real-time rendering. It also proposes an adaptive 3DG addition strategy for
  handling emerging objects in dynamic scenes....
