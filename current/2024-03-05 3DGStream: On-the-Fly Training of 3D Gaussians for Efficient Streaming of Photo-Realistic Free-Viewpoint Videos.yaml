summary: This paper presents 3DGStream, a method for efficient streaming of photo-realistic Free-Viewpoint Videos of real-world dynamic scenes. It uses 3D Gaussians to represent the scene and a Neural Transformation Cache for fast on-the-fly per-frame reconstruction and real-time rendering. It also proposes an adaptive 3DG addition strategy for handling emerging objects in dynamic scenes....
