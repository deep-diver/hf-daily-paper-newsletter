summary: This paper discusses a method for manipulating input speech to sound like it was recorded in a different scene, using a self-supervised learning model that takes advantage of recurring sound events and textures in natural videos. The model learns to transfer the sound properties of a given audio-visual conditional example to the input speech, and can be trained using unlabeled, in-the-wild videos. The authors provide video results on their project webpage....
