summary: This study presents Seed-Prover 1.5, a formal theorem-proving model that uses large-scale agentic reinforcement learning and an efficient test-time scaling workflow. It can solve a high percentage of undergraduate, graduate, and PhD-level problems, including 11 out of 12 problems from Putnam 2025 within 9 hours, by learning from experience and bridging the gap between natural and formal languages....
