summary: This paper presents BitNet b1.58, a 1-bit Large Language Model that matches
  the performance of full-precision LLMs while being more cost-effective. The 1.58-bit
  LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs, enabling
  a new computation paradigm and opening the door for specific hardware optimization....
