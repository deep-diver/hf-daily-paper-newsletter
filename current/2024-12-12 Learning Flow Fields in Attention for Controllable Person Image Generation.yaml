summary: The paper proposes a method called Learning Flow Fields in Attention (Leffa) to improve the quality of controllable person image generation. It achieves this by guiding the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training, reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. The method can be used to control appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), and it is model-agnostic, meaning it can be applied to other diffusio...
