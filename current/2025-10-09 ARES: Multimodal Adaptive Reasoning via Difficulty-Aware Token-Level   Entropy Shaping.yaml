summary: The authors present ARES, a framework that improves multimodal reasoning models by adjusting their exploration based on task difficulty. ARES uses high window-entropy tokens to identify important moments in reasoning and optimizes exploration through a two-stage training process, resulting in better performance and efficiency compared to existing models....
