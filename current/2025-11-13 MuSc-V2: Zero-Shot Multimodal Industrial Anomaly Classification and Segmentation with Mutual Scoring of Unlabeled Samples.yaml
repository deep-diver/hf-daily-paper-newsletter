summary: This study presents a new framework called MuSc-V2 for identifying and outlining defects in industrial products without using labeled samples. By leveraging the unique property that normal image patches are similar to each other, while anomalies are not, MuSc-V2 improves 3D representation, fuses 2D/3D neighborhood cues, and uses a mutual scoring mechanism to assign scores to samples within each modality. The framework achieves significant performance improvements on two datasets, outperforming p...
