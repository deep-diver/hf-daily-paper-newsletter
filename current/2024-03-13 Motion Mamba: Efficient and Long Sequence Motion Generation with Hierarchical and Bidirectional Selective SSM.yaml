summary: This paper proposes Motion Mamba, a simple and efficient approach for long-sequence and efficient motion generation using state space models (SSMs). The method utilizes a Hierarchical Temporal Mamba (HTM) block and a Bidirectional Spatial Mamba (BSM) block to process temporal and spatial data, respectively, resulting in improved motion modeling and real-time human motion generation....
