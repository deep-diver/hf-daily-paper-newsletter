summary: This paper studies how features change when a language model is fine-tuned for different text domains and merged with other models. They start with a simple Transformer model trained on a mix of text and Python code, then adapt it to two new domains (TinyStories and Lua programming) and merge these adapted models using spherical linear interpolation. This helps understand how features change in typical transfer learning scenarios with small models and sparse auto-encoders....
