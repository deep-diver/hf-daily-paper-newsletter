summary: This paper studies 3D super-resolution by leveraging video super-resolution (VSR) models, which provide higher spatial consistency and reference surrounding information. It proposes a simple yet practical approach to align LR images without fine-tuning or generating 'smooth' trajectory from the trained 3D models over LR images. The experimental results show that the simple algorithms can achieve state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark datasets....
