summary: The paper presents SplatDiff, a novel method for high-fidelity Novel View Synthesis that combines the strengths of splatting and diffusion. It addresses the issues of distorted geometry in splatting-based methods and texture hallucination in diffusion-based methods through an aligned synthesis strategy and a texture bridge module, respectively....
