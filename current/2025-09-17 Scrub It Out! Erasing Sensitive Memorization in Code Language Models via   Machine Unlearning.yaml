summary: This study explores a method called machine unlearning to remove sensitive information from Code Language Models (CLMs) without fully retraining them. The proposed CodeEraser technique effectively erases sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the overall integrity and functionality of the model, validated through experiments on three different CLMs....
