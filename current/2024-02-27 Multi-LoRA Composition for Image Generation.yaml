summary: This paper proposes two methods, LoRA Switch and LoRA Composite, for effectively
  composing multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models in text-to-image generation.
  The methods are evaluated on a new testbed called ComposLoRA, which features 480
  composition sets with diverse LoRA categories. The results show improved performance
  over the baseline, especially when using multiple LoRAs....
