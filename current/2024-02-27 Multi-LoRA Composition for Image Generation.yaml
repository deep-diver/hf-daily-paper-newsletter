summary: This paper proposes two methods, LoRA Switch and LoRA Composite, for effectively composing multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models in text-to-image generation. The methods are evaluated on a new testbed called ComposLoRA, which features 480 composition sets with diverse LoRA categories. The results show improved performance over the baseline, especially when using multiple LoRAs....
