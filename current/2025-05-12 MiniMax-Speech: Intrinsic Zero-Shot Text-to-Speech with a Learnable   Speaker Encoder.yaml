summary: The researchers have developed a high-quality, autoregressive Transformer-based TTS model called MiniMax-Speech, which features a learnable speaker encoder for extracting timbre features from reference audio without its transcription. This model can generate highly expressive speech with consistent timbre in a zero-shot manner, supports one-shot voice cloning, and offers various applications like voice emotion control and text to voice synthesis....
