summary: Researchers have developed a method that allows for the insertion of adapters into text-to-image foundation models, enabling complex downstream tasks to be performed while preserving the model's overall performance. This method, which involves optimizing the attention mechanism related to 2D feature maps, was tested on the task of meme video generation and achieved promising results. The code for this method will be made available to the public....
