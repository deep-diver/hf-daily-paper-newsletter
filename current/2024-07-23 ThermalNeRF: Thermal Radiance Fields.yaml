summary: This paper presents a unified framework for scene reconstruction using a multispectral radiance field to represent a scene viewed by both visible and infrared cameras, and demonstrates its effectiveness on real-world sets of RGB and LWIR photographs captured from a handheld thermal camera. The method is capable of thermal super-resolution and visually removing obstacles to reveal occluded objects in either the RGB or thermal channels. The code and dataset are available at https://yvette256.githu...
