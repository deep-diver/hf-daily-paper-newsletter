summary: This study proposes a new benchmark called VCode, which focuses on generating SVG code from images to enhance visual-centric coding. The researchers introduce an agentic framework called VCoder to improve the performance of VLMs in this task, resulting in a significant overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus model....
