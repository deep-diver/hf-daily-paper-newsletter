summary: The study examines the impact of enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLM judges for evaluation tasks. It finds that SFT-tuned judges underperform in reasoning-demanding samples. To overcome this, the researchers present JudgeLRM, a family of judge-wise, outcome-driven RL-trained LLMs, which outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models....
