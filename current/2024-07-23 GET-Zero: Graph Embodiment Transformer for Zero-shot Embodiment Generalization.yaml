summary: A new model called GET-Zero is introduced to create an embodiment-aware control policy that can adapt to new hardware without retraining. It uses a Graph Embodiment Transformer (GET) that leverages the embodiment graph connectivity as a learned structural bias in the attention mechanism. This model improves upon baseline methods by 20% and all code and video results can be found at https://get-zero-paper.github.io...
