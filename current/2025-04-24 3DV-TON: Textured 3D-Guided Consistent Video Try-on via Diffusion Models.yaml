summary: 3DV-TON is a new method for video try-on that generates high-quality and consistent results by using animated 3D meshes as guidance, avoiding motion coherence issues. It also introduces a strategy to prevent artifact propagation and a new high-resolution benchmark dataset, HR-VVT, for video try-on research....
