summary: The study presents a new method called EntroPIC that stabilizes entropy during the long-term training of large language models. By dynamically adjusting the influence of positive and negative samples, EntroPIC ensures efficient exploration and steady progress, preventing the model from collapsing into sub-optimal behaviors....
