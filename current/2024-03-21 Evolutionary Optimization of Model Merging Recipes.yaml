summary: This paper presents an evolutionary approach to automate the creation of powerful foundation models by discovering effective combinations of diverse open-source models, harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring extensive additional training data or compute. This approach enables cross-domain merging and has led to the generation of new state-of-the-art models....
