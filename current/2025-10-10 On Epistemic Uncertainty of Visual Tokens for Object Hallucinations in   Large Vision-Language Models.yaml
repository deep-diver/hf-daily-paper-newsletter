summary: This study identifies uncertain visual tokens in the early layers of a vision encoder as a major cause of object hallucinations in large vision-language models. The researchers propose a new method to reduce object hallucinations by using adversarial perturbations to detect and mask uncertain visual tokens, which significantly improves the accuracy of these models....
