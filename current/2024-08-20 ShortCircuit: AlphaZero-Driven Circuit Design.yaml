summary: We present ShortCircuit, a transformer-based model that uses a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning to generate efficient Boolean circuits from functional descriptions. Our model, which is inspired by AlphaZero, can handle large state spaces and sparse rewards, and it outperforms the current state-of-the-art logic synthesis tool, ABC, in terms of circuit size....
