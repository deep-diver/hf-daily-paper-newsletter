summary: The paper presents a method that uses pretrained text-to-image models as
  a prior to generate multi-view 3D images from real-world data. The method integrates
  3D volume-rendering and cross-frame-attention layers into a U-Net network and uses
  an autoregressive generation process to render 3D-consistent images at any viewpoint.
  The model is trained on real-world datasets and produces high-quality results with
  improved consistency compared to existing methods....
