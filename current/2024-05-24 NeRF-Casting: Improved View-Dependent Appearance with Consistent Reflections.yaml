summary: NeRF-Casting is a method that improves the rendering of shiny objects by casting reflection rays and tracing them through the NeRF representation to render feature vectors. It outperforms prior methods for view synthesis of scenes containing shiny objects and is the only existing NeRF method that can synthesize photorealistic specular appearance and reflections in real-world scenes, while requiring comparable optimization time to current state-of-the-art view synthesis models....
