summary: This paper proposes a new method called SAGS which improves upon 3D Gaussian Splatting by taking into account the 3D structure of a scene. This results in better rendering quality and reduced storage requirements. They also introduce a lightweight version of SAGS which further reduces the size of the scene representation without relying on compression strategies. Experiments show that SAGS outperforms other 3D-GS methods....
