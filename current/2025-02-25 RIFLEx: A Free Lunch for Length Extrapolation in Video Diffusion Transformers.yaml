summary: This work presents RIFLEx, a simple yet effective method to improve length extrapolation in video generation, without causing temporal repetition or motion deceleration. It identifies an intrinsic frequency in positional embeddings that affects extrapolation behavior and reduces it to maintain motion consistency, achieving high-quality 2times extrapolation without any additional modifications and enhancing quality for 3times extrapolation with minimal fine-tuning....
