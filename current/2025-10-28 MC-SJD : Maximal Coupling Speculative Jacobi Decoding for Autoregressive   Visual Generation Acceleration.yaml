summary: This study presents MC-SJD, a method to speed up autoregressive visual generation without sacrificing quality. MC-SJD improves upon the Speculative Jacobi Decoding technique by maximizing the probability of sampling identical draft tokens, leading to up to 4.2 times faster image generation and 13.3 times faster video generation....
