summary: TarFlow is a new architecture for Normalizing Flows (NFs), which are models for continuous inputs. It uses a stack of autoregressive Transformer blocks on image patches, alternating the autoregression direction between layers. TarFlow can directly model and generate pixels, and uses techniques like Gaussian noise augmentation and a post training denoising procedure to improve sample quality. It sets new state-of-the-art results on likelihood estimation for images, and generates samples with qual...
