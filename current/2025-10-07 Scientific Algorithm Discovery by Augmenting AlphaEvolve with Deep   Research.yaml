summary: The study presents DeepEvolve, an agent that combines algorithm evolution and deep research to discover scientific algorithms. DeepEvolve uses external knowledge, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging in a feedback loop to propose, refine, implement, and test new hypotheses, leading to executable and improved algorithms in various scientific domains....
