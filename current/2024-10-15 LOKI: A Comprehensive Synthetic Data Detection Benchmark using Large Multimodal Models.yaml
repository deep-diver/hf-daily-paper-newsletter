summary: LOKI is a benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models' ability to detect synthetic data across multiple modalities like video, image, 3D, text, and audio. It includes various types of questions and tasks to test the models' perception, knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. 22 open-source and 6 closed-source models were evaluated on LOKI, revealing their potential as synthetic data detectors and some limitations in their development....
