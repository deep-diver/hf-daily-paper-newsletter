summary: The authors have created a new dataset called MeViS, which has over 33,000 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, for the purpose of improving video understanding based on motion expressions. They tested various methods on this dataset and found that existing methods struggle with this task, so they developed a new approach called LMPM++, which outperforms previous methods in motion expression-guided video understanding....
