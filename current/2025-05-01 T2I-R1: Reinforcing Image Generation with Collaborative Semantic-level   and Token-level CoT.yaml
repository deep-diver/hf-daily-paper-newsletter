summary: The authors present T2I-R1, a new model that improves text-to-image generation by applying reasoning strategies used in large language models, specifically chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning, to the visual generation domain. They introduce a bi-level reasoning process with semantic-level and token-level chain-of-thought and an optimization method called BiCoT-GRPO, resulting in significant performance improvements over the baseline model and even outperforming the state-of-the-art model...
