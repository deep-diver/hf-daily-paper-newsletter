summary: EzAudio is a transformer-based text-to-audio diffusion model that improves previous models by simplifying the process of text-to-audio generation, enhancing convergence speed, and training stability, and making the training process easier and more efficient. It also introduces a classifier-free guidance rescaling method that simplifies EzAudio by achieving strong prompt alignment while preserving great audio quality when using larger CFG scores, eliminating the need to struggle with finding the ...
