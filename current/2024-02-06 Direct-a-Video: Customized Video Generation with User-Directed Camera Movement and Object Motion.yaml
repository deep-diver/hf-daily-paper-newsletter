summary: This paper presents Direct-a-Video, a system that enables users to independently control object motion and camera movement in video generation, allowing for customized video creation. The system utilizes spatial cross-attention modulation for object motion and introduces temporal cross-attention layers for camera movement, with both components operating independently and generalizing to open-domain scenarios....
