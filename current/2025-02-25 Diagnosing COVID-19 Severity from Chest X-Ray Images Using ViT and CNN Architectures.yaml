summary: This study examines the use of transfer learning and vision transformers to predict the severity of COVID-19 cases from chest x-rays. The project, which combined three datasets, found that a pretrained DenseNet161 model was the best for classification tasks, while a vision transformer (ViT) had the best results for regression tasks....
