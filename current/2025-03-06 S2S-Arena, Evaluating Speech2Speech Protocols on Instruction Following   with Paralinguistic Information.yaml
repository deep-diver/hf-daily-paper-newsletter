summary: This work presents S2S-Arena, a benchmark for evaluating speech2speech models' ability to follow instructions with paralinguistic information. The experiments reveal that a cascaded ASR, LLM, and TTS model performs better than a jointly trained model in speech2speech protocols, and excellent speech models can understand paralinguistic information in speech input but struggle to generate appropriate audio with such information....
