summary: The study examines how different hyperparameters affect the speed and quality of Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Results show a trade-off between speed and accuracy, with Chroma being faster but Faiss providing higher precision, and suggest that a balanced combination of hyperparameters can lead to highly accurate RAG systems, particularly beneficial for applications like clinical decision support in healthcare....
