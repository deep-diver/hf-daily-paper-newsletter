summary: This paper investigates the memorization of tabular data in Large Language Models (LLMs) during training and finds that they have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim, leading to overfitting. The paper also compares the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on seen and unseen datasets and finds that LLMs perform better on seen datasets. The in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs are also limited....
