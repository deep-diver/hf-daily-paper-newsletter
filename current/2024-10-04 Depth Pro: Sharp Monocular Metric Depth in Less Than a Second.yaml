summary: Depth Pro is a fast and accurate foundation model for monocular metric depth estimation. It uses a multi-scale vision transformer and combines real and synthetic datasets for training, resulting in high-resolution depth maps with sharpness and high-frequency details. It also includes a protocol for evaluating boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image. Depth Pro outperforms prior work along multiple dimensions and is available at ht...
