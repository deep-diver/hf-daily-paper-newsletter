summary: This paper presents a new approach for understanding the periodicity structure and semantics of motion datasets, independently of the morphology and skeletal structure of characters. The approach involves learning a shared phase manifold for multiple characters without any supervision, and aligning motions temporally by a phase variable. The paper demonstrates the manifold's capability in several applications, including motion retrieval, transfer and stylization....
