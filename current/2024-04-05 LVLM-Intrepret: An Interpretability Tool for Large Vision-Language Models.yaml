summary: This paper presents a novel interactive application for understanding the internal mechanisms of large vision-language models, specifically focusing on the role of image patches and the efficacy of the language model in grounding its output in the image. The application allows for systematic investigation of the model and can aid in identifying and addressing system limitations....
