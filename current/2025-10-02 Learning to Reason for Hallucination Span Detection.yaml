summary: This study explores the use of reasoning to improve the detection of unsupported content, or 'hallucinations,' generated by large language models. The researchers introduce RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that encourages reasoning with a span-level reward function, which outperforms pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning in detecting hallucinations in various tasks....
