summary: This study presents a new framework called Sparse-LaViDa that speeds up the sampling process of multimodal discrete diffusion models by eliminating unnecessary masked tokens during inference. The framework uses special tokens to maintain generation quality and a custom attention mask to ensure consistency between training and inference, resulting in up to 2x faster performance for tasks like text-to-image generation and image editing....
