summary: This paper introduces Learned Embedding Propagation (LEP) as a cost-efficient method for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific languages. LEP has lower training data size requirements and minimizes the impact on existing LLM knowledge by using an ad-hoc embedding propagation procedure to implant new language knowledge into existing instruct-tuned variants. The authors evaluated LEP on four Russian vocabulary adaptations for LLaMa-3-8B and Mistral-7B, demonstrating that it is competit...
