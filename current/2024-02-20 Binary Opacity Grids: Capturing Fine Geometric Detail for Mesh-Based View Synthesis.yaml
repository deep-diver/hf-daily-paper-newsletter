summary: While surface-based view synthesis algorithms are appealing due to their
  low computational requirements, they often struggle to reproduce thin structures.
  In contrast, more expensive methods that model the scene's geometry as a volumetric
  density field (e.g. NeRF) excel at reconstructing fine geometric detail. However,
  density fields often represent geometry in a "fuzzy" manner, which hinders exact
  localization of the surface. In this work, we modify density fields to encourage
  them to converge ...
