summary: This paper introduces a new efficient family of large language and vision models called Phantom, which improves learning capabilities within limited structures by temporarily increasing the latent hidden dimension during multi-head self-attention. Phantom outperforms numerous larger open- and closed-source LLVMs, making it a leading solution in the landscape of efficient LLVMs....
