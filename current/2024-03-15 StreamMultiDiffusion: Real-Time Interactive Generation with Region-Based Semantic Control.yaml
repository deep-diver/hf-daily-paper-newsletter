summary: The paper presents StreamMultiDiffusion, a real-time region-based text-to-image
  generation framework that achieves 10 times faster panorama generation and 1.57
  FPS in region-based text-to-image synthesis on a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU. The framework
  opens up a new paradigm for interactive image generation named semantic palette,
  where high-quality images are generated in real-time from given multiple hand-drawn
  regions....
