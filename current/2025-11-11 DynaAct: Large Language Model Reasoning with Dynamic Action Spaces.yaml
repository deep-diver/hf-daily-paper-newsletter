summary: The authors propose a new framework called DynaAct to automatically create a manageable action space for improving sequential decision-making in complex problems. By using large language models to estimate action spaces and a submodular function to evaluate and select candidate actions, DynaAct significantly enhances performance on various benchmarks without adding much computational cost....
