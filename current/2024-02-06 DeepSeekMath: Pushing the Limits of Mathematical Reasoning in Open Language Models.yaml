summary: This paper presents DeepSeekMath, a large language model for mathematical reasoning. It uses a pre-trained model with billions of parameters, trained on a combination of math-related and general web data. The model performs well on a math benchmark and the authors attribute its success to the use of carefully selected data and an optimization technique called GRPO....
