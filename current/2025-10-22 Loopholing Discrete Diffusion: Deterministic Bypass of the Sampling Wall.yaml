summary: The authors propose a new method called Loopholing that helps preserve information in discrete diffusion models, improving their performance and reducing generative perplexity by up to 61% compared to previous models. This leads to better text coherence and improved performance on reasoning tasks like arithmetic benchmarks, without relying on autoregressive models....
