summary: 'The study presents a one-stage method for generating high-quality X-ray security images without extra labor cost, which outperforms previous methods by 1.2% mAP and improves prohibited item detection performance. The method, called Xsyn, uses two strategies: Cross-Attention Refinement to refine bounding box annotations and Background Occlusion Modeling to enhance imaging complexity....'
