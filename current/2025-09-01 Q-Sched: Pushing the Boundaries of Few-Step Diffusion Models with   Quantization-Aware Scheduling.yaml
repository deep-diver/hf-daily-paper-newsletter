summary: The authors present a new method called Q-Sched that reduces the size of few-step diffusion models by 4 times while maintaining their quality. This is achieved by adjusting the sampling trajectory of the models and introducing a new loss function called JAQ, which optimizes the models without requiring full-precision inference. The result is a more efficient and effective way to generate high-quality images using fewer computational resources....
