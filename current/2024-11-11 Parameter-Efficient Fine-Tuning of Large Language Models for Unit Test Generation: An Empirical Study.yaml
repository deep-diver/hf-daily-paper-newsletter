summary: This paper explores using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for unit test generation with large language models (LLMs). It compares full fine-tuning and various PEFT methods across different model architectures and sizes, using benchmark datasets. The results show that PEFT methods can deliver performance comparable to full fine-tuning, making specialized fine-tuning more accessible and cost-effective. Prompt tuning is the most effective in terms of cost and resource utilization, wh...
