summary: The study explores how model architectures and pre-training objectives influence feature richness for domain generalization. The proposed method discovers latent domain structures, known as pseudo-domains, to capture domain-specific variations and enhances classifiers with these representations, achieving better generalization to unseen domains, particularly with features from diffusion models, as demonstrated on 5 datasets....
