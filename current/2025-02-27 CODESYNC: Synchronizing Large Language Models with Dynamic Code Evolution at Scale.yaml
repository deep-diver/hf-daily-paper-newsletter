summary: The research presents CODESYNC, a tool for updating large language models (LLMs) with current code knowledge, and CODESYNCBENCH, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to adapt to dynamic code evolution. They found that 14 state-of-the-art LLMs struggled with real-time code updates, even with advanced methods. Their code and dataset are publicly available....
