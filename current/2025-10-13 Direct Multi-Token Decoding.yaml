summary: The study proposes a new method called Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD) that generates multiple tokens using only the late layers of a transformer model, which could speed up the process and reduce the need for repeated traversals of earlier layers. Experiments with a fine-tuned DMTD model showed up to a 2x speedup with minimal performance loss, and it's expected to perform better with larger datasets....
