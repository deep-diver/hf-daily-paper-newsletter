summary: The study examines how to identify weaknesses in large language models (LLMs) as they become more advanced, focusing on a scenario where the LLM's capabilities surpass those of the testers. The researchers found that more capable models are better at finding vulnerabilities, but success rates drop when the model being tested is more capable. They also discovered that LLMs perform well on social science tasks, and created a formula to predict attack success based on the capability gap between the...
