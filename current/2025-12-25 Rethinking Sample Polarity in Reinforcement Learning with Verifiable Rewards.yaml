summary: Large AI models improve their reasoning by learning from both good and bad examples they generate, where good examples reinforce existing correct thought processes and bad ones encourage trying new solution paths. A new method called A3PO improves this learning by precisely adjusting how much impact individual parts of these good and bad examples have, leading to better performance on various reasoning challenges....
