summary: This paper presents GES, a new method to model 3D scenes using Generalized
  Exponential Function instead of Gaussians, resulting in fewer particles required,
  faster rendering, and improved accuracy in representing sharp edges. GES performs
  better than Gaussian Splatting in both theoretical and empirical analysis, and reduces
  memory footprint while maintaining visual quality....
