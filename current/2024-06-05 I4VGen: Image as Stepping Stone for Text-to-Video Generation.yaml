summary: 'I4VGen is a training-free and plug-and-play video diffusion inference framework that enhances text-to-video generation by leveraging robust image techniques. It decomposes the text-to-video generation into two stages: anchor image synthesis and anchor image-guided video synthesis. This inference strategy effectively mitigates the prevalent issue of non-zero terminal signal-to-noise ratio and improves overall video quality....'
