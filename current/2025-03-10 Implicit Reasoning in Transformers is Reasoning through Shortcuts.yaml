summary: This work investigates implicit reasoning in language models, finding that they can perform step-by-step reasoning and achieve high accuracy in both in-domain and out-of-domain tests, but only when trained on fixed-pattern data. However, models trained on unfixed-pattern data tend to overfit a specific pattern and fail to generalize, suggesting that language models acquire implicit reasoning through shortcut learning....
