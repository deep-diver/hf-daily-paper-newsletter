summary: The paper presents CodeMonkeys, a system for scaling test-time compute for solving real-world GitHub issues. CodeMonkeys allows models to iteratively edit a codebase by generating and running a testing script alongside their draft edit, and uses a voting method with model-generated tests for selecting between candidate edits. The system resolves 57.4% of issues from SWE-bench Verified using a budget of approximately 2300 USD....
