summary: This study investigates using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models for robotic control, aiming to create task-specific visual representations without fine-tuning the model. The researchers found that directly applying text-based conditions didn't work well due to a gap between the model's training data and robotic environments, so they developed ORCA, which uses adaptable task and visual prompts to generate better representations, ultimately outperforming previous methods in robotic contro...
