summary: We propose a new model, Visual State Space Duality (VSSD), that improves the performance of State Space Duality (SSD) in vision tasks by making it non-causal. This is achieved by discarding the magnitude of interactions between the hidden state and tokens while preserving their relative weights, and using multi-scan strategies to integrate scanning results. VSSD outperforms existing SSM-based models on various benchmarks including image classification, detection, and segmentation....
