summary: This study presents a new framework called Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG) that improves text-to-image generation by alternating between text-based thinking and image synthesis. The framework, trained using the Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL) method, outperforms existing models, resulting in better visual quality and fine-grained fidelity....
