summary: 'The paper presents a new model called AVESFormer, which is designed to be efficient and capable of real-time audio-visual segmentation. It addresses two key issues in previous models: attention dissipation and inefficient transformer decoder. The model uses an efficient prompt query generator and ELF decoder to improve performance and reduce computational burdens. Extensive experiments show that AVESFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art models and achieves an excellent trade-off between p...'
