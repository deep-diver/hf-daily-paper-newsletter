summary: This paper proposes a method to build and reuse a library of adapters for large language models (LLMs) to improve performance on new tasks. It introduces model-based clustering (MBC) to group tasks based on adapter similarity and a novel zero-shot routing mechanism called Arrow for dynamic selection of relevant adapters. Experiments show that MBC-based adapters and Arrow routing lead to superior generalization to new tasks....
