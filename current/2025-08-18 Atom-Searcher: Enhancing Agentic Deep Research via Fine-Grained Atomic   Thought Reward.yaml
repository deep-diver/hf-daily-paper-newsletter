summary: This study presents a new approach called Atomic Thought that breaks down reasoning into smaller parts for large language models, enabling them to better tackle complex tasks by using fine-grained rewards. The proposed Atom-Searcher framework, built on Atomic Thought, significantly improves the models' performance in agentic deep research, making their reasoning more interpretable and human-like....
