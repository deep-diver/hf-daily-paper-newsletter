summary: The authors present a framework called CharacterShot that allows designers to create dynamic 3D characters from a single image and a 2D pose sequence. They use a powerful 2D animation model, a dual-attention module, and a novel optimization technique to generate consistent and stable 4D character representations, and introduce a large-scale dataset to improve character-centric performance....
