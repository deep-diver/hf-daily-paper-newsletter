summary: This paper proposes VideoCrafter2, a method to overcome the limitations of high-quality video diffusion models by leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images. The authors analyze the connection between spatial and temporal modules in video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos, and observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling. They then finetune spatial modules with high-quality images to shift the distribution to higher quality...
