summary: This paper proposes a method to improve the performance of latent diffusion models by aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. This method allows for faster convergence of the models and ultimately leads to better image generation. An enhanced DiT baseline is also introduced to further improve the performance of the models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstr...
