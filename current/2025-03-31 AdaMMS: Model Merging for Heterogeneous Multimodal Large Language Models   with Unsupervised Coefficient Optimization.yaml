summary: The proposed AdaMMS method addresses the challenges of merging heterogeneous Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by introducing a novel model merging method tailored for them. Through mapping the models, adapting to asymmetry in weights, and employing an unsupervised hyper-parameter selection method, AdaMMS outperforms previous methods in various vision-language benchmarks....
