summary: This work improves latent consistency models for high-quality sampling with one or two steps, addressing challenges like impulsive outliers in latent data and the performance gap between latent consistency and diffusion models. The solutions include using Cauchy losses, a diffusion loss at early timesteps, optimal transport coupling, an adaptive scheduler, and Non-scaling LayerNorm....
