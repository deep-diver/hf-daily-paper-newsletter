summary: This study compares integer and floating-point quantization formats for AI hardware, revealing that while floating-point is better for coarse-grained quantization, integer formats, specifically MXINT8, outperform them in fine-grained quantization for 8-bit formats. The research also presents a method to minimize gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit integer training, enhancing the performance of MXINT8....
