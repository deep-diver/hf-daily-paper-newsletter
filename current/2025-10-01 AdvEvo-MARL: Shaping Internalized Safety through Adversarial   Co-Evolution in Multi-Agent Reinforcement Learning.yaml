summary: The study presents a new framework called AdvEvo-MARL that combines safety and task performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning systems. This framework uses adversarial learning to train agents to resist attacks while achieving their goals, resulting in lower attack success rates and improved task accuracy compared to existing methods, without needing additional guard agents or increasing system overhead....
