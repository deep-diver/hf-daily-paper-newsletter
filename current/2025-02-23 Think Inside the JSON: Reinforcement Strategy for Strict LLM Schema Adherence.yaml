summary: The study introduces a reinforcement learning approach named ThinkJSON to ensure strict adherence to schema in large language model generation, using a 1.5B parameter model and a novel pipeline combining synthetic reasoning dataset construction with custom reward functions under Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The model demonstrates robust performance in enforcing schema consistency and is more resource-efficient than previous approaches....
