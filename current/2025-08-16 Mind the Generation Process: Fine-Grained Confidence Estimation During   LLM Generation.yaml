summary: The authors present FineCE, a new method for accurate and detailed confidence scoring during text generation by large language models. They create a pipeline for generating training data that reflects the model's probabilistic distribution, then train a model to predict confidence scores for any text sequence. Additionally, they propose a strategy to improve confidence estimation using information from subsequent text and introduce strategies for optimal confidence estimation positions. FineCE o...
