summary: We propose a new method for creating 3D shapes and images from a small number of colored pictures. This method uses a special kind of computer model called a Signed Distance Function (SDF) and a radiance field. The model learns to create 3D shapes by using information from multiple pictures and making the SDF field as straight as possible. This helps the model to work better even when there is noise in the pictures. Our method, called SparseCraft, is the best at creating new images and 3D shapes...
