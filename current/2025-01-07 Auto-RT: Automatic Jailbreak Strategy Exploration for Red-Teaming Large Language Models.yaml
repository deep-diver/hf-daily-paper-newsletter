summary: Auto-RT is a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). It uses Early-terminated Exploration to focus on high-potential attack strategies and Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models to dynamically refine the search trajectory. This results in faster detection and higher success rates compared to existing methods....
