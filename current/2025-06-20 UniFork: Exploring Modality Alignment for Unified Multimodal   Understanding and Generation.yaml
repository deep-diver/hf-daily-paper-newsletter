summary: The authors analyze the modality alignment behaviors of unified multimodal models and discover that understanding tasks require increasing modality alignment while generation tasks require decreasing modality alignment. They then introduce a novel Y-shaped architecture called UniFork that shares shallow layers for cross-task representation learning and uses task-specific branches in deeper layers to balance shared learning and task specialization....
