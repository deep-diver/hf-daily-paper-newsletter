summary: A study that critically examines the assumption that RLVR enhances reasoning capabilities in LLMs beyond the base model, and finds that RL training boosts performance by biasing the model's output distribution towards rewarding paths, but results in a narrower reasoning capability boundary compared to base models, suggesting that most reasoning abilities manifested in RL-trained models are already obtained by base models....
