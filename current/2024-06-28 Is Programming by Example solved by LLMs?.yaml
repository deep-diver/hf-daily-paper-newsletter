summary: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve Programming-by-Examples (PBE) tasks, which involve generating algorithms from input-output examples. The authors find that pretrained models are not effective at PBE, but can be fine-tuned for higher performance if the test problems are in-distribution. The study also identifies ways in which LLMs still fall short in out-of-distribution generalization....
