summary: The paper presents Video-R1, a method to improve video reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by addressing challenges in applying RL training to video reasoning, such as lack of temporal modeling and scarcity of high-quality video-reasoning data. To tackle these, they propose the T-GRPO algorithm for utilizing temporal information and incorporating image-reasoning data, and build two datasets for training. Video-R1 demonstrates significant performance improvements on various vide...
