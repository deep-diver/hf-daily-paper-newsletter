summary: LLaVA-o1 is a new Vision-Language Model that can perform step-by-step reasoning on complex tasks. It uses a structured approach and a smaller dataset than other models, but still outperforms them on multimodal reasoning tasks. It also uses a new inference-time scaling method that helps it reason better....
