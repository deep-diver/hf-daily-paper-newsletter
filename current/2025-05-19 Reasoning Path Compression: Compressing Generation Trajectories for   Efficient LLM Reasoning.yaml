summary: The authors present a method called Reasoning Path Compression (RPC) that enhances the efficiency of language models in reasoning tasks. RPC reduces memory usage and improves generation speed by compressing the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths, allowing for practical deployment of reasoning LLMs with minimal accuracy loss....
