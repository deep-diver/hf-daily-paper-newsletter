summary: This study examines the reasoning processes of large language models (LLMs) and introduces a new method called RePro to improve their performance. RePro assesses and optimizes LLM reasoning by defining a surrogate objective function and utilizing a dual scoring mechanism, which is integrated into reinforcement learning pipelines to enhance reasoning performance and reduce suboptimal behaviors across various tasks and models....
