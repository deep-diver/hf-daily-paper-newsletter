summary: This study explores if inference-time techniques that improve reasoning in language models can also benefit vision-language models, focusing on those trained with reinforcement learning. The results indicate that while some decoding strategies enhance VLM performance, generation-based methods outperform verification-based ones, and the self-correction behavior from RL training doesn't provide significant improvements....
