summary: The authors propose a novel approach to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning and proof capabilities through counterexamples. They introduce a high-quality, university-level mathematical benchmark, CounterMATH, and a data engineering framework to improve model performance by providing counterexamples, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts....
