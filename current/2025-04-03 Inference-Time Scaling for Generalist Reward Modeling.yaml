summary: This work explores improving reward modeling for general queries by investigating inference-time scalability and using a pointwise generative reward modeling approach, combined with Self-Principled Critique Tuning for scalable behavior. The proposed method uses parallel sampling and a meta RM for effective scaling, outperforming existing methods and models without severe biases, and could potentially achieve better performance than training-time scaling....
