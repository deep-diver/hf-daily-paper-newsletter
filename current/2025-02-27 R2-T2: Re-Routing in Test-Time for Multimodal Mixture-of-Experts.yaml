summary: The abstract describes a novel method, R2-T2, to improve the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) by locally optimizing the vector of routing weights in test-time. This method involves moving the vector towards those of correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of the test sample, using three different R2-T2 strategies with varying optimization objectives and neighbor-search spaces....
