summary: LiveSpeech is a new text-to-speech method that allows for low-latency streaming by using a language model to predict audio tokens in real-time. This is achieved by using adaptive codebook loss weights and grouping codebooks for parallel processing. The method is competitive with state-of-the-art baselines in terms of content accuracy, speaker similarity, audio quality, and inference speed....
