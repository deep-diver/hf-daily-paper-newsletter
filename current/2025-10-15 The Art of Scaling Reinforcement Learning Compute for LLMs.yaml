summary: This study is the first large-scale systematic analysis of scaling reinforcement learning in large language models, involving over 400,000 GPU-hours. The researchers established a framework to analyze and predict RL scaling, identified factors affecting compute efficiency, and proposed a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, for stable and scalable RL training....
