summary: 'The authors present FlashVSR, a practical one-step streaming framework for real-time video super-resolution using diffusion models. They introduce three key innovations: a three-stage distillation pipeline, locality-constrained sparse attention, and a tiny conditional decoder, which together enable real-time performance, scalability, and high-quality reconstruction. They also release a large-scale dataset, VSR-120K, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with significant speedup over previ...'
