summary: The paper introduces a method to compute the optimal acceptance rate for Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) and measures the theoretical upper bound for its efficiency. It compares different draft sampling methods and finds that sampling without replacement outperforms sampling with replacement, while existing verification algorithms do not reach the theoretical upper bound....
