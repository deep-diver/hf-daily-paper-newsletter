summary: ColorBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate the color understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), including color perception, reasoning, and robustness. The benchmark reveals that larger models perform better but the performance gaps are small, indicating that color understanding has been neglected by existing VLMs. The findings also show that CoT reasoning improves color understanding accuracies and robustness, but color clues can mislead models in some tasks....
