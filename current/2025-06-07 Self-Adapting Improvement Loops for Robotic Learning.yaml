summary: The authors present a method called Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL) that allows robots to improve their task performance over time by learning from their own experiences and a large pre-trained video model. This approach is tested on various tasks and found to be effective in enhancing robot performance on new tasks without requiring extensive initial demonstrations or strict filtering of collected experiences....
