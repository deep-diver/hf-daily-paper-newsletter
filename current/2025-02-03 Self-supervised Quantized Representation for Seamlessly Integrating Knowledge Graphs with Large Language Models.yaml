summary: The framework learns and applies quantized codes for entities, compressing both structural and semantic KG knowledge into tokens that align with language sentences. This enables seamless integration with LLMs, outperforming unsupervised quantized methods and requiring fewer tokens per entity for tasks like KG link prediction and triple classification....
