summary: The authors present RL^V, a method that combines any 'value-free' reinforcement learning approach with a generative verifier, trained together using RL-generated data. This results in improved accuracy, efficient test-time compute scaling, and strong generalization capabilities for various tasks, without significant additional computational cost....
