summary: The framework presented generates aligned novel view images and geometry using a diffusion-based method, which is different from previous methods that need specific images or models. It uses predicted partial geometries and treats novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both images and geometry, with cross-modal attention distillation ensuring accurate alignment between generated images and geometry. Additionally, proximity-based mesh conditioning is used to integrate depth and normal cue...
