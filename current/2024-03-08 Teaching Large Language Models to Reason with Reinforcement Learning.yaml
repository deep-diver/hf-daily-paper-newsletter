summary: The paper investigates the performance of several algorithms for improving
  large language model reasoning capabilities using reinforcement learning from human
  feedback. They find that all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration
  performing best in most cases and requiring a similar amount of samples as PPO.
  They also discuss the trade-off between different metrics during fine-tuning and
  the implications of their findings for the future of LLM fine-tuning with reinforcement
  learning....
