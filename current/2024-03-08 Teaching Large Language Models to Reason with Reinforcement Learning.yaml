summary: The paper investigates the performance of several algorithms for improving large language model reasoning capabilities using reinforcement learning from human feedback. They find that all algorithms perform comparably, with Expert Iteration performing best in most cases and requiring a similar amount of samples as PPO. They also discuss the trade-off between different metrics during fine-tuning and the implications of their findings for the future of LLM fine-tuning with reinforcement learning....
