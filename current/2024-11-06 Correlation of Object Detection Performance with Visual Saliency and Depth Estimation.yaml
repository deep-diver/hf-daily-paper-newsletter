summary: 'This paper examines the connections between object detection accuracy and two fundamental visual tasks: depth prediction and visual saliency prediction. It finds that visual saliency shows stronger correlations with object detection accuracy compared to depth prediction, and these correlations vary across object categories, with larger objects showing higher correlation values. The paper suggests incorporating visual saliency features into object detection architectures could be more beneficial ...'
