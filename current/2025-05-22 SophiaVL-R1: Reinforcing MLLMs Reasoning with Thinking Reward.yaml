summary: The authors propose SophiaVL-R1, a new approach to improve reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models by adding reward signals for the thinking process. They introduce a thinking reward model, a method to assess its reliability, and an annealing training strategy, resulting in a model that outperforms others, including one with 10 times more parameters, on various benchmarks....
