summary: This study presents Chunk-GRPO, a new approach for generating text-to-image using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). By optimizing at the 'chunk' level (groups of consecutive steps) instead of individual steps, Chunk-GRPO better captures the temporal dynamics and improves advantage attribution, leading to better performance in both preference alignment and image quality....
