summary: The authors present TARS, a new method that reduces inaccuracies in multimodal large language models by treating hallucination-related preferences as flexible targets, rather than fixed ones. TARS improves the models' reliability by minimizing overfitting to superficial cues and preserving the connection to relevant visual information, demonstrating superior performance on various hallucination benchmarks....
