summary: This study explores how vision models can understand graphs as well as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) but in different ways. The researchers created a new benchmark to test models' ability to understand global graph properties, finding that vision models excel at tasks requiring holistic understanding and are better at scale-invariant reasoning, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction....
