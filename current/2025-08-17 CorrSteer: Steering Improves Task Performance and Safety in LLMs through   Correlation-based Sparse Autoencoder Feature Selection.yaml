summary: The authors present CorrSteer, a method that selects features from large language models using correlation between sample correctness and activation from generated tokens, which results in improved task performance and automation of the steering process. This approach has shown significant improvements in various benchmarks and reveals semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements....
