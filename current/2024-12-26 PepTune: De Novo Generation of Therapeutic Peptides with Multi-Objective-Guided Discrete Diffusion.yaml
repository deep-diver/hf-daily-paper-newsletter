summary: This paper introduces PepTune, a new method for creating peptides that can treat diseases. PepTune helps scientists make peptides that are good at binding to targets, going through cell membranes, and being soluble, among other things. It uses a type of computer program called a diffusion model, which helps find the best combinations of peptides that work well for different purposes. The method is tested on different types of diseases and shows promising results....
