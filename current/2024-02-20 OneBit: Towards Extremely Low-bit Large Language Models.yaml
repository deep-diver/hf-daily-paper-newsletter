summary: This paper presents a way to make large language models use very little storage
  space by representing their weight matrices using only 1-bit values. This is done
  through a method called 1-bit quantization-aware training, which includes new techniques
  for initialization and parameter representation. The results show that this approach
  works well and is fast to train....
