summary: This paper suggests that using multiple smaller vision models at different scales can be more effective than using a single larger model for tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and robotic manipulation. The authors demonstrate that features from larger models can be well approximated by those from multi-scale smaller models, and that pre-training smaller models with this approach can match or even exceed the performance of larger models....
