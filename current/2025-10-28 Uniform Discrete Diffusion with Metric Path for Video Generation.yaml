summary: The researchers developed a new framework called URSA that significantly improves discrete video generation methods, making them more efficient and comparable to continuous approaches. URSA uses two key designs, Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting, to enable high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation with fewer inference steps. It also includes an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy for versatile tasks, outperforming existing discrete ...
