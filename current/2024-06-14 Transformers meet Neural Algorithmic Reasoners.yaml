summary: We present a new method that improves the accuracy of language models by combining them with graph neural networks. This hybrid approach allows the models to understand and solve algorithmic tasks more effectively, especially when the tasks are specified in graph form. Our model, called TransNAR, performs significantly better than traditional language models on the CLRS-Text benchmark, both in and out of distribution....
