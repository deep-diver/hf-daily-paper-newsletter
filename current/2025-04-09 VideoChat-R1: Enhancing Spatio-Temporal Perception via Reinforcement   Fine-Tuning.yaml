summary: This study explores Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for video Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve their spatio-temporal perception. The developed VideoChat-R1 model, achieved through multi-task RFT on limited samples, outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatio-temporal perception tasks without compromising chat ability, and also shows improvements in general QA benchmarks....
