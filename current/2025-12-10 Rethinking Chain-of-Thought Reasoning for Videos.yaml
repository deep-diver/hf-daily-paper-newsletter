summary: This study explores whether shorter reasoning processes and fewer visual tokens can be as effective as longer, human-like reasoning chains and large numbers of visual tokens for video understanding in large language models. The researchers develop and test a new method that allows models to use compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning paths, resulting in faster and more efficient models that perform competitively on various benchmarks without relying on manual or supervised training...
