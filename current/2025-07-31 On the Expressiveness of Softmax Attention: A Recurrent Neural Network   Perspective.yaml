summary: This study shows that linear attention is a simplified version of softmax attention by presenting the recurrent form of softmax attention, which helps explain its higher expressiveness compared to other attention mechanisms. By understanding the components of softmax attention in the context of recurrent neural networks, the research provides insight into why linear attention typically underperforms in terms of accuracy....
