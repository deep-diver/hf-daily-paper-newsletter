summary: This study presents RAPTOR, a method for training a generalized neural-network policy to control various quadrotors. The policy, trained using a novel Meta-Imitation Learning algorithm, adapts quickly to new, unseen quadrotors through In-Context Learning, demonstrating strong performance in diverse conditions....
