summary: The paper addresses the limitation of MLLMs in handling visual text grounding, especially in text-rich document images. To bridge this gap, the authors propose TRIG, a novel task with a new instruction dataset, and a pipeline for creating manually annotated question-answer pairs as a benchmark and a large-scale training set. They also propose two methods to improve the grounding capability of MLLMs on text-rich images....
