summary: The paper proposes a method called VSTAR to improve the quality and dynamics of longer video synthesis generated by open-source text-to-video models. VSTAR uses a technique called Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), which involves generating a video synopsis and refining the temporal attention units of the model, to provide better control over the video's visual content and improve its dynamics....
