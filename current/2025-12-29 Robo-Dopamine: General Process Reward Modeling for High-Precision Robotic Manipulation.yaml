summary: Robots learning new skills often struggle because it's hard to precisely tell them if they're making progress, especially with complex tasks and only one viewpoint. A new system called Dopamine-Reward helps robots understand their actions better by using many camera angles and breaking down progress into clear, small steps. This approach allows robots to learn intricate manipulation tasks much faster and more reliably, leading to significant improvements in their success rate with minimal traini...
