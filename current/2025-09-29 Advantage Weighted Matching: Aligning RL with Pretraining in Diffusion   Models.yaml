summary: This study analyzes a new approach called Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM) for aligning reinforcement learning with pretraining in diffusion models. AWM reduces variance and speeds up convergence by giving more weight to high-reward samples and less to low-reward ones, using the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining, resulting in a significant improvement over existing methods....
