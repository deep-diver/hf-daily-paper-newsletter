summary: Many smart computer programs use a small AI to condense information for a bigger AI, but figuring out the best way to design that "condensing" AI used to be a guessing game. A clever way to measure how much useful information the small AI keeps now predicts how well the whole program will work, showing that making the condensing AI more powerful is far more effective than making the main AI bigger, resulting in systems that are both better and cheaper....
