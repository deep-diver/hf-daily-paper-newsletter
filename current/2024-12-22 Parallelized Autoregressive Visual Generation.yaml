summary: This paper proposes a method to speed up the generation of images and videos using autoregressive models by generating weakly dependent tokens in parallel and maintaining sequential generation for strongly dependent local tokens. It achieves a 3.6x speedup with comparable quality and up to 9.5x speedup with minimal quality degradation across both image and video generation tasks....
