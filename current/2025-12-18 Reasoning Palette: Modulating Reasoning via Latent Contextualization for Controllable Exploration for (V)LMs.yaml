summary: The authors present a new method called Reasoning Palette that enhances the reasoning abilities of large language models by introducing a stochastic latent variable, which helps generate diverse and high-level reasoning paths. This approach allows for more efficient exploration and improved performance in both inference-time tasks and reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by experiments on various reasoning benchmarks....
