summary: The authors present a new verifier called OPV that accurately and efficiently checks the reasoning process of long chains of thought by using summarized outcomes. They improve the verifier's performance through an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations, which reduces the need for expensive human annotations. Experiments show OPV's superior performance and ability to detect errors, outperforming larger models and improving the accuracy of policy models....
