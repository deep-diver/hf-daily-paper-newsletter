summary: The study trains a Taboo model, a language model that describes a secret word without explicitly stating it, to explore techniques for revealing hidden knowledge. The researchers evaluate both black-box and mechanistic interpretability approaches, finding both effective in uncovering the secret word. This work contributes to ensuring the safe and reliable deployment of language models by addressing the issue of secret knowledge....
