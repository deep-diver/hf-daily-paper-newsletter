summary: This research reveals that Group Relative REINFORCE, usually considered an on-policy algorithm, can actually be interpreted as an off-policy algorithm. The study offers new insights into adapting REINFORCE for off-policy settings, debunks some misconceptions about GRPO, and provides a theoretical foundation for data-weighting strategies used in off-policy reinforcement learning for language models....
