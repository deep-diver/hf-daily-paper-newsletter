summary: This paper proposes Self-Rewarding Language Models, where the language model itself provides its own rewards during training using LLM-as-a-Judge prompting. By doing so, the model improves its ability to provide high-quality rewards and instruction following abilities. Fine-tuning Llama 2 70B on three iterations of this approach shows promising results, outperforming many existing systems on the AlpacaEval 2.0 leaderboard. The study suggests the potential for models that can continually improve ...
