summary: This paper introduces a large text-to-speech model called BASE TTS, which is trained on 100K hours of speech data and converts text into speech using a 1-billion-parameter model. The model achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and shows 'emergent abilities' when trained with large amounts of data. The authors also share a specialized dataset to measure these abilities and provide audio samples of the model....
