summary: This research examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) perceive knowledge boundaries in multiple languages, using internal representation probes. The study reveals that LLMs' knowledge boundary perception is encoded in middle to middle-upper layers, follows a linear language structure, and can be improved through fine-tuning on bilingual question pairs. The authors also propose a training-free alignment method to transfer knowledge boundary perception ability across languages and construct a mu...
