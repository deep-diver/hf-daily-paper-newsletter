summary: The Klear-Reasoner model is introduced, which has strong reasoning abilities and carefully considers problems, outperforming many existing models. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the model's training process, including data preparation, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, and proposes a new Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization method to improve the model's exploration and learning efficiency....
