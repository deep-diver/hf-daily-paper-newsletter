summary: This paper suggests using larger kernel sizes in Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for better performance. They introduce a new type of ConvNet called UniRepLKNet that uses large kernels to capture more spatial information without needing as many layers. This new model performs better than previous ones and can be used for different tasks like image recognition, time-series forecasting, audio, point cloud, and video recognition. The paper also shows that larger kernel sizes can help reduc...
