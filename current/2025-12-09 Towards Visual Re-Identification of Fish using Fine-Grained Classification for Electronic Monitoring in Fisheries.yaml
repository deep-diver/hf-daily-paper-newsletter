summary: This study presents a refined deep learning model for automatically identifying fish in video data collected by Electronic Monitoring systems, which is more efficient than manual review. The proposed model, based on the Swin-T architecture, significantly improves fish re-identification metrics compared to a conventional model, with the main challenge being the distinction of similar-looking fish of the same species....
