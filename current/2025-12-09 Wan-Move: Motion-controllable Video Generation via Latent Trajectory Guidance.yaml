summary: The authors propose Wan-Move, a straightforward and efficient system for controlling motion in video generation models, by integrating motion-aware features into the model without changing its architecture. This approach enables high-quality, precise motion control, and the resulting videos are on par with commercial tools, as demonstrated by user studies and extensive experiments on a new benchmark dataset....
