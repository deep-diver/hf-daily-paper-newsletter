summary: The study proposes a framework called ProtoReasoning, which improves the reasoning ability of large language models by utilizing prototypical representations. This framework enhances performance on various tasks, including logical reasoning, planning, and mathematics, by learning from shared abstract reasoning patterns, leading to better generalization to new problems....
