summary: The study presents InsertAnywhere, a new framework for realistic video object insertion that handles scene geometry, occlusion, and lighting effects better than existing methods. It uses a 4D aware mask generation module and a diffusion-based video generation model, trained with a new synthetic dataset called ROSE++, to create visually coherent and geometrically plausible object insertions in various real-world scenarios....
