summary: The authors present a new framework called SynthAgent that enhances the quality of synthetic data for web agents by refining both tasks and trajectories. They generate diverse tasks by exploring web elements, refine tasks during trajectory collection to reduce errors, and conduct global trajectory refinement to minimize noise. The resulting high-quality synthetic data allows for better adaptation of open-source web agents to new websites, as demonstrated by experimental results....
