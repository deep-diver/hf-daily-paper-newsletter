summary: The paper introduces a method called LongAlign to improve the alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with long texts. It involves segment-level encoding and preference optimization, which helps overcome the limitations of existing encoding methods and enhances the alignment between the generated images and the input text. The method is tested on Stable Diffusion v1.5 and shows better alignment compared to other foundation models....
