summary: The paper evaluates the ability of 17 leading Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow threads of information through their context window. Surprisingly, many models can follow multiple threads simultaneously without significant loss in performance. However, the effective context limit for many models is shorter than the supported context length, with accuracy decreasing as the context window grows. Additionally, the study highlights that token counts from different tokenizers should not be direct...
