summary: The study presents Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), a system that creates customized problem-solving strategies at inference time based on past experiences. EGuR can adapt all strategy components, including prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic, to optimize problem-solving, resulting in up to 14% accuracy improvements and up to 111x reduction in computational costs across five challenging benchmarks....
