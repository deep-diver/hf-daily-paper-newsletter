summary: The authors present a new method called Phase-Preserving Diffusion (φ-PD) that maintains spatial structure during data corruption, making it suitable for tasks requiring geometric consistency. They also introduce Frequency-Selective Structured noise for controlling structural rigidity and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in various applications, including improving CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50%....
