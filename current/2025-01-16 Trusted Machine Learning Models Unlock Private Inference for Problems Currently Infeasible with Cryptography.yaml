summary: This paper proposes using capable machine learning models as trusted third parties to enable secure computations for applications that were previously infeasible with cryptographic methods, such as multi-party computations or zero-knowledge proofs. The approach, called Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs), aims to balance privacy and computational efficiency, and it has been shown to solve even some simple classic cryptographic problems....
