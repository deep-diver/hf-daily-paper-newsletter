summary: This study presents Vid2World, a method to utilize pre-trained video diffusion models for creating interactive world models, improving their ability to predict transitions in complex environments by enabling autoregressive generation and enhancing action controllability. The approach has been successfully tested in robot manipulation and game simulation domains....
