summary: This study introduces a new framework called DIJA that exploits safety weaknesses in diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs). DIJA constructs adversarial prompts that take advantage of the model's bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding, causing it to generate harmful content even when alignment mechanisms are in place. The method significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, highlighting the need for improved safety measures in dLLMs....
