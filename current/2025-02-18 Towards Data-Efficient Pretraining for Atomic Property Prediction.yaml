summary: A study challenges the notion that larger datasets are always better for atomic property prediction. It introduces the Chemical Similarity Index (CSI) to select the most relevant dataset for pretraining. The results show that pretraining on a smaller, focused dataset can outperform large-scale pretraining, even when the larger datasets contain relevant data....
