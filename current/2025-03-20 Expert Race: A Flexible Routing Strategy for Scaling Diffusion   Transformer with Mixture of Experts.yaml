summary: The proposed Race-DiT model enhances diffusion transformers using a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race, which dynamically assigns experts to critical tokens. Additionally, it incorporates per-layer regularization to tackle shallow layer learning challenges and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring efficient expert utilization and improved performance, as validated by experiments on ImageNet....
