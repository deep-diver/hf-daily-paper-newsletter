summary: This paper introduces a new model called the 2-Dimensional Autoregression (DnD) Transformer for generating higher quality images compared to traditional methods. The DnD-Transformer can even generate images with text and graphical elements in a self-supervised manner, demonstrating a spark of vision-language intelligence when trained solely on images....
