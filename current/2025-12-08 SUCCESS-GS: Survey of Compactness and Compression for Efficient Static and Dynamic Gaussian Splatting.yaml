summary: 'This study offers a comprehensive review of methods to efficiently represent 3D and 4D scenes using Gaussian Splatting, a technique that allows for real-time, high-quality 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The methods can be broadly categorized into two groups: Parameter Compression and Restructuring Compression, which help reduce memory and computational demands while maintaining reconstruction quality....'
