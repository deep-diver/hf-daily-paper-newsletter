summary: This research introduces a pipeline that uses automated test-case synthesis to improve code model training, addressing the challenge of reliable reward data/model in the code domain. The method generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data, creates preference pairs based on pass rates, and trains reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. This leads to significant improvements in model performance across various benchmarks for both large-scale and smaller models, demonstra...
