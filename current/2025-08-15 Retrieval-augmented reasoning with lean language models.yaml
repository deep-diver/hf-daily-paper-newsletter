summary: The authors present a new method for creating a lean language model that combines reasoning and retrieval augmented generation in a single architecture, aimed at resource-constrained or secure environments. This model, which can interpret complex queries using a lightweight backbone, significantly improves answer accuracy and consistency by fine-tuning it with domain-specific data, making it feasible for local deployment....
