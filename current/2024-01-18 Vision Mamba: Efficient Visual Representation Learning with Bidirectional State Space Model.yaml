summary: The paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim) for efficient and generic visual representation learning. Vim overcomes the computation and memory constraints for high-resolution images and outperforms well-established vision transformers on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks.
