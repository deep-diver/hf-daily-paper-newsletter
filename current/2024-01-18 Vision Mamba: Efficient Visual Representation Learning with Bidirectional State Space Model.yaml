summary: Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., Mamba, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance of visual representation learning on self-attention ...
