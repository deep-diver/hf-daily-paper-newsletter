summary: We propose a novel policy parameter generator, Make-An-Agent, that uses conditional diffusion models to generate control policies for agents based on just one demonstration of desired behaviors as a prompt. Our model demonstrates strong versatility, scalability, and generalization ability across various tasks and domains, including real-world robot locomotion tasks....
