summary: This paper proposes a new approach to designing state-space models (SSMs) for sequence modeling by considering them as meta-modules for online learning problems. By formulating precise online learning objectives, the paper introduces a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Experimental results show that the proposed models outperform existing SSMs on sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks....
