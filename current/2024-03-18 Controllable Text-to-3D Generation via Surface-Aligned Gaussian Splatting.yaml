summary: We present a new method called Multi-view ControlNet (MVControl) for controllable text-to-3D generation. MVControl is a neural network architecture that enhances existing pre-trained multi-view diffusion models by incorporating additional input conditions, such as edge, depth, normal, and scribble maps. We also propose an efficient multi-stage 3D generation pipeline that leverages recent advances in large reconstruction models and score distillation algorithms. Our method uses 3D Gaussians as th...
