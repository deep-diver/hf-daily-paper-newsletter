summary: Cycle3D is a new 3D generation framework that uses a 2D diffusion model and a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model together to create high-quality and consistent 3D images. It improves the quality of the images by using a 2D diffusion model to create high-quality textures and a reconstruction model to ensure that the images are consistent across different views. It also improves the diversity and texture consistency of the 3D generation process by controlling the generated content and injecting ...
