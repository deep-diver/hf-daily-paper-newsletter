summary: Optima is a framework that improves communication efficiency and task effectiveness in LLM-based multi-agent systems by training LLMs. It uses a reward function to balance task performance, token efficiency, and communication readability. Optima also uses RL algorithms and Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired techniques to improve performance. It shows consistent and substantial improvements over single-agent baselines and vanilla MAS based on Llama 3 8B, achieving up to 2.8x performance gain with l...
