summary: This study extends the concept of equivariant networks to account for time-based transformations, like moving images, in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The new flow equivariant RNNs outperform traditional RNNs in training speed, predicting future steps, and adapting to different speeds, marking a step towards more realistic sequence modeling....
