summary: This paper introduces Video-Infinity, a distributed inference pipeline that enables parallel processing across multiple GPUs for long-form video generation. It uses Clip parallelism and Dual-scope attention mechanisms to optimize communication and context sharing, and generate long videos up to 2,300 frames in 5 minutes, which is 100 times faster than prior methods....
