summary: 'The study presents a transparent and reproducible method for training multimodal reasoning models, called OpenMMReasoner, which consists of two stages: supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. By focusing on high-quality data and careful training design, the proposed recipe significantly outperforms existing baselines and paves the way for future research in large-scale multimodal reasoning....'
