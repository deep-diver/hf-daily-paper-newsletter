summary: This paper introduces Spider2-V, a benchmark for testing the ability of multimodal agents to automate data science and engineering workflows. The benchmark includes real-world tasks and evaluates the agents' performance in writing code and managing GUI in enterprise data software systems. The paper finds that existing state-of-the-art agents do not reliably automate full data workflows and underperform in tasks that require fine-grained, knowledge-intensive GUI actions and involve remote cloud-h...
