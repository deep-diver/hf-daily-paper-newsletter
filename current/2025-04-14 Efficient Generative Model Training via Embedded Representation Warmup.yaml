summary: The paper proposes a method called Embedded Representation Warmup (ERW) to improve the training efficiency and representation quality of diffusion models, which struggle with these aspects compared to self-supervised methods. ERW warms up the early layers of the diffusion model with high-quality, pretrained representations, accelerating convergence and boosting performance, as demonstrated by a 40 times speedup in training compared to the current state-of-the-art methods....
