summary: This study proposes a new method called LASER-D to improve the efficiency of large reasoning models in solving complex problems through reinforcement learning. LASER-D adjusts rewards dynamically based on the model's reasoning behavior and the difficulty of the problem, resulting in faster and more concise reasoning patterns with less redundancy....
