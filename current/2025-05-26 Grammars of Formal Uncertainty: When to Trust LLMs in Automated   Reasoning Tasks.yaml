summary: This study examines the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in generating formal specifications for automated reasoning tasks, which require deterministic guarantees. The researchers develop a probabilistic context-free grammar framework to better understand and quantify the uncertainty in LLM outputs, leading to a more reliable process for using LLMs in formalization tasks....
