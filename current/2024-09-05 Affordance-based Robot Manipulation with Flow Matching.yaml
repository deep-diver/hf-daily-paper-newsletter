summary: This paper proposes a framework for assistive robot manipulation that efficiently adapts large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks and effectively learns robot trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. The framework uses a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method and a supervised Flow Matching method to learn robot trajectories. The paper also introduces a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test the framework. The evalua...
