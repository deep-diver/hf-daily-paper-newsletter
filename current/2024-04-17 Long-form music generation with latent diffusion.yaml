summary: This paper presents a new generative model for long-form music generation that utilizes a diffusion-transformer operating on a highly downsampled continuous latent representation. The model produces music of up to 4m45s with coherent structure and obtains state-of-the-art generations according to audio quality and prompt alignment metrics....
