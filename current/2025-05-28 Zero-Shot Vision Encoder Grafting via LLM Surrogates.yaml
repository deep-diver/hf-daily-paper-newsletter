summary: The research presents a method to reduce the cost of training vision language models by using smaller 'surrogate models' that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target model. This zero-shot grafting process allows vision encoders trained on the surrogate to be directly transferred to the larger model, improving performance and reducing training costs by about 45%....
