summary: This paper introduces Glyph-ByT5, a customized text encoder that improves
  the accuracy of visual text rendering by being character-aware and aligned with
  glyphs. Glyph-ByT5 is created by fine-tuning the ByT5 encoder using a curated paired
  glyph-text dataset. It significantly improves text rendering accuracy and enables
  text paragraph rendering with automated multi-line layouts. Fine-tuning Glyph-ByT5
  with photorealistic images also improves scene text rendering in open-domain real
  images....
