summary: The paper proposes sliding tile attention (STA) as a hardware-friendly alternative to the full-attention mechanism used in state-of-the-art video generation models, which is computationally expensive. STA focuses on localized 3D windows within the input data, improving efficiency and reducing end-to-end latency without compromising quality....
