summary: We propose SeFAR, a semi-supervised learning framework for fine-grained action recognition. SeFAR uses dual-level temporal elements, temporal perturbation, and adaptive regulation to improve performance. Experiments show that SeFAR outperforms other methods on two fine-grained action recognition datasets and two coarse-grained action recognition datasets....
