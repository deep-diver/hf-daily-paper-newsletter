summary: This paper introduces HGRN2, an improvement on HGRN1, which is a language modeling method. HGRN2 uses a state expansion mechanism to increase expressiveness without adding extra parameters. Experiments show that HGRN2 performs well in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena tasks....
