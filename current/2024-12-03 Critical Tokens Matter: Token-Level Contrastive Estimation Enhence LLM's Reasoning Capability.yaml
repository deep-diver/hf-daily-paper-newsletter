summary: In this paper, we introduce cDPO, a novel approach that identifies and rewards critical tokens during the alignment process in Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. We use a contrastive estimation approach to identify critical tokens and extend the conventional DPO algorithms to token-level DPO for better alignment with critical token information. Our approach is evaluated on GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks with Llama-3 (8B and 70B) and deepseek-math (7B) models, demon...
