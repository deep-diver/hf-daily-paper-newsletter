summary: The researchers present Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes a lightweight visual projector for efficient multimodal transfer, without requiring retraining of the language or vision models. They propose a hybrid optimization strategy for visual-text alignment and an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation, resulting in a model with 38B parameters that delivers competitive performance on MMMU, MathVista, AIME, and MATH500 benchmarks....
