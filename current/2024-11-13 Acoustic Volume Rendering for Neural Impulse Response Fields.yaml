summary: The paper proposes a new method called Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR) to model acoustic impulse responses, which are essential for realistic audio synthesis in virtual and augmented reality. AVR uses frequency-domain volume rendering and spherical integration to fit IR measurements, resulting in accurate and realistic impulse response synthesis. The paper also introduces AcoustiX, a new acoustic simulation platform that provides more accurate IR simulations than existing simulators. The code fo...
