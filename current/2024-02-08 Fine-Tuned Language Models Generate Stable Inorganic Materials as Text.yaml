summary: This paper proposes fine-tuning large language models to generate stable inorganic materials as text, with around 90% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints. The models can be used for unconditional generation, infilling of partial structures, and text-conditional generation, and the ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale....
