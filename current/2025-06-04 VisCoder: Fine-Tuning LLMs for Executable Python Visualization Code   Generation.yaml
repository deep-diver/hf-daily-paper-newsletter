summary: Researchers created VisCode-200K, a large dataset with over 200K examples for training LLMs in generating executable Python visualization code, including 45K multi-turn correction dialogues. They fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on this dataset to develop VisCoder, which significantly outperforms open-source baselines and is close to proprietary models in generating accurate, executable visualization code....
