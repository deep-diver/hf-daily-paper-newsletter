summary: This paper introduces Elastic Cache, a novel approach that improves the efficiency of instruction-following large vision-language models by applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. It proposes an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches and enhances the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. Results show that Elastic Cache boosts efficiency and outperfo...
