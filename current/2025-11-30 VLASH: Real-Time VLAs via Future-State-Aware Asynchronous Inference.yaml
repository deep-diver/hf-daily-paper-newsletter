summary: The study presents VLASH, a new framework for Vision-Language-Action models that enables smooth, fast, and accurate real-time control without additional overhead or changes to the existing architecture. VLASH improves speed and reduces reaction latency compared to traditional methods and allows VLAs to perform high-precision tasks like playing ping-pong and whack-a-mole....
