summary: The paper introduces a new framework for evaluating and improving step-by-step visual reasoning in large language models (LLMs). It proposes a visual reasoning benchmark, a new metric for evaluating individual reasoning steps, and a new multimodal model called LlamaV-o1 trained using a multi-step curriculum learning approach. The paper also compares LlamaV-o1 to existing models and shows that it outperforms them while being faster during inference scaling. The benchmark, model, and code are publ...
