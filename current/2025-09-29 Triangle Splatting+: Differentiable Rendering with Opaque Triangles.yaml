summary: This study presents an improved method for reconstructing 3D scenes and generating new views, called Triangle Splatting+. It directly optimizes triangles, which are basic building blocks of computer graphics, within a differentiable framework, leading to high-quality visuals and faster training compared to previous methods, and enabling further applications like physics simulations and interactive explorations....
