summary: The paper proposes a dynamic strategy for compute allocation in diffusion transformers, which optimizes resource usage and allows a single flexible model to generate high-quality images with less compute for both class- and text-conditioned generation. This method can also be applied to video generation with up to 75% less compute without sacrificing performance....
