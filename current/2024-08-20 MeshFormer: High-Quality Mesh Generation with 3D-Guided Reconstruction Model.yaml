summary: MeshFormer is a 3D reconstruction model that uses an explicit 3D structure and projective bias to improve the efficiency and quality of generated meshes. It incorporates input normal maps and Signed Distance Function supervision to refine the learning of geometry and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained details. It can be integrated with 2D diffusion models for fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks....
