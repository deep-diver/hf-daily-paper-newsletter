summary: This study addresses the lack of explainability in hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models by introducing QuXAI, a framework that uses Q-MEDLEY to explain feature importance in these systems. The results demonstrate that Q-MEDLEY effectively identifies influential classical aspects and noise in HQML models, outperforming established XAI techniques in classical validation settings....
