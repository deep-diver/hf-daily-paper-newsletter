summary: The researchers created a new model called VL-Cogito that uses a special training method called Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (PCuRL) to improve its reasoning skills for complex multimodal tasks. This training method makes the model practice harder tasks over time and adjusts the difficulty level as needed, making it better at understanding and solving problems in various fields like math, science, and logic....
