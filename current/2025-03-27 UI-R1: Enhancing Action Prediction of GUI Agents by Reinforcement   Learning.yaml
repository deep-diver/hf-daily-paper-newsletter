summary: The paper proposes a method to improve the reasoning capabilities of multimodal language models for GUI action prediction tasks using rule-based reinforcement learning. The authors curated a dataset of 136 challenging tasks and introduced a unified rule-based action reward, resulting in a data-efficient model called UI-R1-3B that outperforms the base model on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks....
