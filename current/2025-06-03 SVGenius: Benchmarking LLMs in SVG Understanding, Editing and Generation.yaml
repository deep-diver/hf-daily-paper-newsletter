summary: 'The study presents SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models and multimodal LLMs in processing SVG files, which covers 2,377 queries across three dimensions: understanding, editing, and generation. The benchmark assesses 22 models across various categories and reveals that while proprietary models perform better than open-source ones, all models struggle with complexity, suggesting that reasoning-enhanced training is more effective than scaling for improving perfor...'
