summary: The paper examines the trend of scaling in sampling-based search, a method of using test-time compute to generate and verify multiple candidate responses. The study reveals that increased sampling leads to better verification accuracy, and introduces principles to enhance self-verification, including comparing responses for error detection and utilizing different model output styles for various contexts. The paper also finds that current models have weak verification capabilities and proposes a ...
