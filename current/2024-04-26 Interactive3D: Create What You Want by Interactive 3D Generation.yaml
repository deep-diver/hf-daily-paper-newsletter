summary: This paper presents Interactive3D, a framework that allows users to have precise control over 3D object generation through extensive 3D interaction capabilities, including adding/removing components, deformable/rigid dragging, geometric transformations, semantic editing, and interactive hash refinement. This improves the controllability and quality of 3D generation....
