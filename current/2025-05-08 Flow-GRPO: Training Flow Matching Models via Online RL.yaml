summary: The study presents a novel method called Flow-GRPO, which combines online reinforcement learning with flow matching models. This approach uses an ODE-to-SDE conversion for statistical sampling and a Denoising Reduction strategy to improve sampling efficiency, resulting in significant improvements in text-to-image tasks and human preference alignment without reward hacking....
