title: 'Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach'

summary: A novel language model architecture is proposed that scales test-time computation through implicit reasoning in latent space, using a recurrent block that unrolls to arbitrary depth at test-time. This model can improve performance on reasoning benchmarks without specialized training data, and can capture reasoning types not easily represented in words....
