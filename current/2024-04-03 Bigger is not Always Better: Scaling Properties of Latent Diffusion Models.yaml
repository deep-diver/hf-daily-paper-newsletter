summary: The paper finds that smaller latent diffusion models can generate high-quality results more efficiently than larger models under a given inference budget, challenging the belief that bigger models are always better. The study also demonstrates the generalizability of these findings across various diffusion samplers, tasks, and post-distilled models, and suggests new strategies for scaling latent diffusion models to enhance their generative capabilities within limited inference budgets....
