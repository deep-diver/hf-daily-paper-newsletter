summary: The paper investigates the design of visually-conditioned language models by compiling a suite of standardized evaluations and exploring key design axes. They develop a unified framework for VLM evaluation, optimized code for training, and resource contributions of checkpoints and models that outperform the current state-of-the-art VLM models....
