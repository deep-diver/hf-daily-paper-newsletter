summary: This paper proposes a new algorithm, Dataset Reset Policy Optimization (DR-PO), for fine-tuning generative models using Reinforcement Learning from Human Preference-based feedback. The algorithm integrates an offline preference dataset into the online policy training procedure by resetting the policy optimizer to the states in the offline dataset, resulting in improved performance compared to existing methods....
