summary: The study explores if complex LLMs can perform well without an explicit thinking process. It finds that a simple prompting method, NoThinking, outperforms the traditional thinking process in low-budget settings, and even becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. The paper also shows that a parallel scaling approach using NoThinking to generate N outputs and aggregating them can outperform various baselines with similar latency using Thinking....
