summary: This paper presents OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs, constructed using the Mixtral model and a novel prompting scheme. The dataset is open-source and commercially permissive, allowing for the use of open-source LLMs in math instruction tuning. The best model trained on the dataset achieves competitive scores on popular math reasoning benchmarks....
