summary: This study demonstrates that inference-time techniques like in-context learning can replicate the performance of computationally expensive fine-tuning methods for transformer models, using fewer resources. The research provides a theoretical foundation for deploying large language models more efficiently, with practical applications like retrieval-augmented generation....
