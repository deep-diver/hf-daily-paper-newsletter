summary: Track4Gen is a video generator that improves visual coherence by combining video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. It merges video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network and reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation....
