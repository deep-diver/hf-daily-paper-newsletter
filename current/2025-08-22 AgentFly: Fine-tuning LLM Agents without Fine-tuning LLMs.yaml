summary: The authors present a new method for creating adaptive Large Language Model (LLM) agents that learn from experiences without requiring expensive fine-tuning of the LLMs. This approach, called AgentFly, uses memory-based online reinforcement learning, allowing for efficient, continuous learning in real-time, and outperforms existing methods in various tasks and scenarios....
