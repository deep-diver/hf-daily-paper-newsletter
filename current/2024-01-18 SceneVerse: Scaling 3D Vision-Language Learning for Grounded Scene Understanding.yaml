summary: This paper presents SceneVerse, the first million-scale 3D vision-language dataset, and introduces Grounded Pre-training for Scenes (GPS), a unified pre-training framework for 3D vision-language learning. The dataset and framework address major challenges in 3D vision-language grounding by tackling complex 3D scenes, scarcity of data, and the need for a unified learning framework. GPS outperforms existing benchmarks and demonstrates potential for zero-shot transfer in 3D vision-language tasks. P...
