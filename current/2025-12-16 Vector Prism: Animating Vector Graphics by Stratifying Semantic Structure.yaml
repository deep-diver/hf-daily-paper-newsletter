summary: The paper proposes a framework to improve animation of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) using vision-language models (VLMs). By aggregating multiple weak part predictions, the framework recovers the semantic structure of SVGs, enabling VLMs to produce more coherent animations. Experiments show significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the importance of semantic recovery for robust SVG animation....
