summary: 'This paper introduces a new method called SceneVTG that uses a Multimodal Large Language Model and a conditional diffusion model to create high-quality text images in real-world scenarios. The method is designed to meet three key criteria: fidelity, reasonability, and utility. SceneVTG outperforms traditional rendering-based methods and recent diffusion-based methods in terms of fidelity and reasonability, and it provides superior utility for tasks involving text detection and text recognition. ...'
