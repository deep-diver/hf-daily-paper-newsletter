summary: The authors propose using human brain activity as a coordinate system to read and steer the states of large language models (LLMs), as an alternative to textual supervision. They construct a word-level brain atlas and extract latent axes to map LLM hidden states, demonstrating that this approach yields interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior, with promising results in various models and sanity checks....
