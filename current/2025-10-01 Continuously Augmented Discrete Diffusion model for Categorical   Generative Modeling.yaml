summary: The study presents a new framework called Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD) that improves upon traditional discrete diffusion models by introducing a continuous latent space. This enhancement allows for more informative and less corrupted masked tokens, leading to better generative quality in text, image, and code modeling....
