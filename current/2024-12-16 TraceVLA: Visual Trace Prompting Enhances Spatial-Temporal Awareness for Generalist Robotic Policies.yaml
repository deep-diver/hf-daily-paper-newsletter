summary: We present a new approach called visual trace prompting to improve the spatial-temporal awareness of large vision-language-action models for robotic learning. Our method involves encoding state-action trajectories visually, which helps the models better understand the spatial-temporal dynamics in interactive robotics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by developing a new model called TraceVLA, which outperforms existing models in various robot manipulation tasks and exhibits robus...
