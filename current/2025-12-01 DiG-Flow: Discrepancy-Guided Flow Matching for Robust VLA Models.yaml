summary: The study presents a new method called DiG-Flow to improve the performance of Vision-Language-Action models on robotic manipulation tasks. By using geometric regularization, DiG-Flow enhances model robustness and reduces errors in complex, multi-step tasks, making the models more reliable even with limited training data....
