summary: This study explores using large language models (LLMs) for optimizing assembly code performance through reinforcement learning. The researchers developed a framework that trains LLMs to improve execution performance while maintaining code accuracy, resulting in an average speedup of 1.47x compared to a standard compiler, demonstrating the potential of LLMs as effective assembly code optimizers....
