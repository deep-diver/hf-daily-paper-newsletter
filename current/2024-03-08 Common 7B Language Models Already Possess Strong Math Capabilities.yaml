summary: A language model with common pre-training already has strong mathematical abilities, but its reliability in generating correct answers needs to be improved. Scaling up the synthetic data can significantly enhance its reliability, as it proves to be nearly as effective as real data and shows no clear saturation when scaled up to approximately one million samples....
