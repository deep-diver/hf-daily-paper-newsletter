summary: The authors present MMaDA, a new type of multimodal diffusion model that uses a unified architecture, a mixed long chain-of-thought fine-tuning strategy, and a unified RL algorithm for improved performance in textual reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. Experiments show that MMaDA outperforms other models in these tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures....
