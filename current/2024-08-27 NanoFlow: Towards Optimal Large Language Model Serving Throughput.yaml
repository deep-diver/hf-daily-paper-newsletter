summary: NanoFlow is a serving framework that increases the speed of LLMs by using a device's resources more efficiently. It splits requests into smaller parts and uses different parts of the device at the same time to process them. This results in a 1.91x boost in throughput compared to existing systems, and it can be easily used with different models....
