summary: One4D is a unified framework for generating and reconstructing dynamic 4D content, such as synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps, from single images, full videos, or sparse frames. It uses a novel approach called Decoupled LoRA Control to generate high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps, contributing to general, high-quality 3D world modeling using video diffusion models....
