summary: The paper presents SRPO, a new framework for Vision-Language-Action models in robotic manipulation that eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by using the model's own successful trajectories as a self-reference. SRPO improves training efficiency by assigning progress-wise rewards to failed attempts, using latent world representations to measure behavioral progress, and achieving a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% on the LIBERO benchmark....
