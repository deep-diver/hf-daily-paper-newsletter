summary: Part123 is a new method for creating 3D models from a single image that includes separate parts. It uses a diffusion model to generate multiple images from the original one and then uses a powerful segmentation model to create segmentation masks. These masks are used to create a feature space that helps in creating a 3D model with separate parts. The method can generate high-quality 3D models with separate parts that can be used for various applications like feature-preserving reconstruction, pr...
