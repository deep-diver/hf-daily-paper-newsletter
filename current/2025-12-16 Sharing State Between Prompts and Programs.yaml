summary: The study proposes a new programming concept, shared program state, which allows natural language code to interact directly with program variables and objects, eliminating the need for manual work to enable interoperability between natural language code and formal languages. The researchers implemented this concept in the Nightjar programming system, which enables Python programs to contain natural code that shares the Python program state, achieving higher task accuracy and decreasing the lines...
