summary: This research addresses challenges in applying Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) by proposing DeepVideo-R1. DeepVideo-R1 uses a new method called Reg-GRPO, which predicts the advantage in GRPO directly, and a difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy, to improve video reasoning performance on various benchmarks....
