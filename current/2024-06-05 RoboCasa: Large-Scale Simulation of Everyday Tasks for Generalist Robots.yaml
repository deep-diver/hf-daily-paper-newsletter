summary: The paper proposes RoboCasa, a large-scale simulation framework for training generalist robots in everyday environments, using realistic physical simulation and generative AI tools to scale environments, tasks, and datasets for robot learning methods. It presents a set of 100 tasks for systematic evaluation and demonstrates the promise of harnessing simulation data in real-world tasks....
