summary: The study examines errors in large language models' tool usage and introduces CRITICTOOL, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating these models' ability to handle complex tool-use errors. The researchers use a novel strategy to create a diverse set of errors, reflecting real-world scenarios, and conduct experiments to validate the benchmark's effectiveness. They also analyze the tool reflection ability on various LLMs, providing new insights into the field of tool learning in large language mode...
