summary: The study presents HyCodePolicy, a framework that combines language, geometry, and perception to improve decision-making in embodied agents. It decomposes instructions into subgoals, generates executable programs, and uses vision-language models to monitor and repair the programs during task completion, resulting in more robust and efficient robot manipulation policies....
