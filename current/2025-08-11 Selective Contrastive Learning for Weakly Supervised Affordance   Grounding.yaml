summary: The authors propose a method for weakly supervised affordance grounding, which helps recognize object parts that allow certain actions without needing pixel-level annotations. This method uses selective prototypical and pixel contrastive objectives to adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at both the part and object levels, improving upon existing techniques that often focus on unrelated patterns....
