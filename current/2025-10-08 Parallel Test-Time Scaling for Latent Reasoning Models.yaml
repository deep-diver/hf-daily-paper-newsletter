summary: The study presents two new methods, Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive Gaussian Noise, for sampling in continuous vector spaces used in latent reasoning models, and introduces a Latent Reward Model for aggregating outcomes. Experiments show that these methods improve model performance and offer new directions for scalable inference in continuous spaces....
