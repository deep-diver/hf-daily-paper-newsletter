summary: This study identifies that expert failures in complex subtasks provide value, so the authors propose Exploring Expert Failures (EEF), which integrates beneficial actions from failed expert trajectories into the training dataset to improve agent tuning performance and solve unsolvable subtasks. EEF outperforms Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT) and GPT-4 in WebShop, achieving a 62% win rate and setting a new state-of-the-art as the first method to surpass a score of 0.81 in WebShop and exceed 8...
