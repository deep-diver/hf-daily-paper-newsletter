summary: The authors present a new method called Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS) that helps vision-language models better utilize visual evidence by transforming question-conditioned masked views into signals that shape perception. BiPS encourages models to focus on relevant visual details and avoid relying solely on textual information, leading to improved performance and generalization across various benchmarks....
