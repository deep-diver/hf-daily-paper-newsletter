summary: This study presents a new method called CLIPGaussians that allows for unified style transfer across various formats, including 2D images, videos, 3D objects, and 4D scenes. By working directly with Gaussian primitives and integrating into existing pipelines, CLIPGaussians enables joint optimization of color and geometry, maintains temporal coherence in videos, and preserves model size, all without requiring large generative models or retraining....
