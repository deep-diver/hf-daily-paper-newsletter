summary: The paper presents Typed-RAG, a type-aware multi-aspect decomposition framework for non-factoid question answering (NFQA), which classifies NFQs into different types and applies aspect-based decomposition to refine retrieval and generation strategies. The proposed method outperforms baselines in the Wiki-NFQA benchmark dataset, highlighting the importance of type-aware decomposition for effective retrieval and generation in NFQA....
