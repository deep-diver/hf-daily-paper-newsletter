summary: This paper presents SpotLight, a method for controlling the lighting in object relighting by specifying the desired shadows of the object. It shows that injecting only the shadow of the object into a pre-trained diffusion-based neural renderer enables it to accurately shade the object according to the desired light position, while harmonizing the object and its shadow within the target background image. SpotLight leverages existing neural rendering approaches and achieves controllable relighting...
