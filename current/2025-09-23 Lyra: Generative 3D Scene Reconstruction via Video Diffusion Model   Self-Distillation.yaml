summary: This study presents a method to create 3D scenes using a self-distillation framework that transfers knowledge from video diffusion models to an explicit 3D representation, allowing for 3D scene generation without needing real-world multi-view data. The proposed technique can generate both static and dynamic 3D scenes from text or single image prompts, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods....
