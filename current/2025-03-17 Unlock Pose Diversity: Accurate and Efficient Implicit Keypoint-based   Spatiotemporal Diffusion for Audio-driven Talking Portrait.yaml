summary: The paper presents KDTalker, a framework that combines unsupervised implicit 3D keypoints with a spatiotemporal diffusion model for audio-driven talking portrait generation. KDTalker addresses the limitations of keypoint-based methods in capturing fine facial details and the identity distortion and high computational costs of image-based approaches, resulting in temporally consistent, high-quality animations with improved lip synchronization accuracy and head pose diversity....
