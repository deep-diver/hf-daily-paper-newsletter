summary: This survey explores how large multimodal reasoning models, which learn from various types of data like vision and sound, can understand and reason about spaces, similar to human spatial abilities. The survey categorizes recent advancements in these models, provides open benchmarks for evaluation, and covers various spatial tasks, including 3D visual question answering and embodied AI, to establish a foundation for the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning....
