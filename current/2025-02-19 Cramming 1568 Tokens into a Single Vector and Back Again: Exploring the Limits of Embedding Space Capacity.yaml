summary: The paper investigates the limits of compression by optimizing per sample instead of using a model to compress sequences of tokens. It demonstrates that vectors with up to x1500 compression exist, revealing a gap between existing solutions and practical attainability, and that the limits are determined by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced rather than input length....
