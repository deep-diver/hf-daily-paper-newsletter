summary: This paper presents a machine-human pipeline for generating very long-term
  dialogues using LLM-based agent architectures and grounding them on personas and
  temporal event graphs. The pipeline is used to collect LoCoMo, a dataset of long-term
  conversations, and evaluate long-term memory in models using a comprehensive benchmark
  of tasks. Results show that LLMs have challenges understanding lengthy conversations
  and comprehending long-range dynamics within dialogues....
