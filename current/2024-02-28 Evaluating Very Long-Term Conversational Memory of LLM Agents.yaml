summary: This paper presents a machine-human pipeline for generating very long-term dialogues using LLM-based agent architectures and grounding them on personas and temporal event graphs. The pipeline is used to collect LoCoMo, a dataset of long-term conversations, and evaluate long-term memory in models using a comprehensive benchmark of tasks. Results show that LLMs have challenges understanding lengthy conversations and comprehending long-range dynamics within dialogues....
