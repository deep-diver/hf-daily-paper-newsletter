summary: This study presents a new evaluation method, CoT-Pass@K, which checks both the reasoning path and final answer to measure the reasoning ability of Large Language Models. The study confirms that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can effectively incentivize correct reasoning, and this ability generalizes well, as demonstrated by the improved performance of RLVR models using the new evaluation metric....
