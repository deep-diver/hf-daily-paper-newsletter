summary: The paper presents a method to improve automatic speech recognition in unseen accents and domains without needing target ground truth data. The method uses two ASR models trained on real and pseudo-labeled data to create a correction vector that reduces errors in the pseudo-labeled target model, resulting in a significant improvement in recognition accuracy....
