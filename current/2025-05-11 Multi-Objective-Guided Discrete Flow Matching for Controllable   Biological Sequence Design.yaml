summary: The study presents MOG-DFM, a new method for designing biological sequences that balances multiple conflicting criteria, which improves upon existing discrete flow matching models by enabling multi-objective optimization and maintaining discrete distributions. The method is demonstrated to effectively generate optimized peptide binders and designed DNA sequences with specific properties....
