summary: The paper offers a detailed look at Discrete Diffusion Language and Multimodal Models, which generate text and process multiple data types faster and more controllably than traditional models by using a parallel decoding method. The authors cover the history, math, and types of these models, as well as techniques for training and applications in language, vision, and biology, predicting future research directions....
