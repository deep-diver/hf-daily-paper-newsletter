summary: The paper presents Reflect-DiT, a method for improving text-to-image generation using inference-time scaling and in-context reflection. Reflect-DiT allows diffusion transformers to refine generations based on previously generated images and textual feedback, outperforming best-of-N sampling with 20 samples per prompt on the GenEval benchmark....
