summary: MotionPro is a new tool that improves the control of motion in image-to-video generation by using localized trajectories and motion masks, making it possible to precisely regulate fine-grained movements and distinguish between object and camera movement. The authors also created a new benchmark, MC-Bench, for evaluating these capabilities and demonstrated MotionPro's effectiveness through extensive experiments....
