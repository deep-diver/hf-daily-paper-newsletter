summary: The authors analyze the memory decay mechanism of Mamba, a state-space model, and propose a new framework called MemMamba. MemMamba improves long-range memory retention in Mamba by summarizing state information and using cross-layer and cross-token attention, resulting in better performance and efficiency on long-sequence tasks compared to existing methods....
