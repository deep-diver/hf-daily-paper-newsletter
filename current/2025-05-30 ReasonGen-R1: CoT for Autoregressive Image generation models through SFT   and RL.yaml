summary: The authors present a new method called ReasonGen-R1 that combines text-based reasoning and reinforcement learning to improve image generation models. They train the model using a new dataset of text prompts and refine it using a technique called Group Relative Policy Optimization, resulting in better image quality compared to existing methods....
