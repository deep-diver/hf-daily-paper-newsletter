summary: Taipan is a new type of language model that combines the efficiency of Mamba with the performance of Transformers. It uses Selective Attention Layers (SALs) to identify important tokens and improve their representations using an attention module. This approach allows Taipan to make accurate predictions for very long sentences while still being efficient with memory and computational resources. Experiments show that Taipan performs well on different scales and tasks, making it a promising solutio...
