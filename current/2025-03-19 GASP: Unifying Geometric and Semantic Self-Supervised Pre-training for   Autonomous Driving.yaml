summary: The proposed GASP method is a self-supervised pre-training approach for autonomous driving that learns a unified representation of the environment and its changes over time by predicting general and ego occupancy, along with distilled features from a vision foundation model. GASP is validated on various autonomous driving benchmarks, showing significant improvements in semantic occupancy forecasting, online mapping, and ego trajectory prediction....
