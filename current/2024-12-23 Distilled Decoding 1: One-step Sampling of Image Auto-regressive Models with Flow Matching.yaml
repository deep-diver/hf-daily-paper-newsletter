summary: We propose Distilled Decoding (DD), a method to adapt pre-trained auto-regressive models to generate outputs in just one or two steps, significantly improving generation speed without sacrificing quality. This is achieved by creating a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained model, which is then distilled into a network for few-step generation. DD doesn't require the training data of the original model, making it more practical. We evaluate ...
