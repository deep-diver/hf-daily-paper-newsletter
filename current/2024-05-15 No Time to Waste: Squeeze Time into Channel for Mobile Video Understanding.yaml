summary: This paper introduces a lightweight video recognition network called SqueezeTime for mobile video understanding. It squeezes the time axis of a video sequence into the channel dimension and uses a Channel-Time Learning Block to capture temporal dynamics and enhance inter-temporal object modeling. SqueezeTime is faster and more accurate than previous methods on various video recognition and action detection benchmarks....
