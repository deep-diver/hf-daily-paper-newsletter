summary: This paper presents a curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training that uses distribution-level learnability and the Upper Confidence Bound principle to optimize learning efficiency. The framework adaptively schedules training across distributions, improving convergence speed and final performance, as demonstrated on logic reasoning datasets....
