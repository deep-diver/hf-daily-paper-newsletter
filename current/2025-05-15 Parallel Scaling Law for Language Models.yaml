summary: The study presents a new method called parallel scaling (ParScale) that improves inference efficiency in language models by increasing parallel computation during training and inference, without significantly increasing parameters or memory usage. ParScale can reduce memory and latency increase compared to traditional parameter scaling, and can also enhance existing pre-trained models with minimal additional training, making powerful models more accessible in low-resource scenarios....
