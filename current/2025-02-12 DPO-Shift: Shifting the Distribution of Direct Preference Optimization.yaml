summary: This work presents a method to shift the distribution of chosen probability in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to address the issue of likelihood displacement. The method demonstrates a trade-off between improving the chosen probability and sacrificing the reward margin, and it outperforms DPO on downstream tasks like MT-Bench and a win rate experiment....
