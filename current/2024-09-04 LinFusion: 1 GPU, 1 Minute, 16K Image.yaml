summary: This paper introduces LinFusion, a novel linear attention mechanism that aims to address the challenges of generating high-resolution visual content in diffusion models. By leveraging pre-trained models and distilling their knowledge, LinFusion achieves performance on par with or superior to the original StableDiffusion, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. It delivers satisfactory zero-shot cross-resolution generation performance, generating high-resolution images like 16K r...
