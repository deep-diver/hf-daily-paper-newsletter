summary: This paper introduces a new method called Outcome-Refining Process Supervision for code generation. It uses concrete execution signals to guide reasoning steps and maintains multiple solution trajectories simultaneously. Experiments show that even small models can solve complex programming tasks with high accuracy and efficiency. The method is more reliable than traditional reward models and achieves significant improvements across 5 models and 3 datasets. The results suggest that providing stru...
