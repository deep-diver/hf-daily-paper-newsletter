summary: The paper discusses a problem where multimodal LLMs struggle to maintain focus on visual information during reasoning, leading to text-over-relied outputs. The authors propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a method that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens, improving the model's attention to visual components and achieving state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks....
