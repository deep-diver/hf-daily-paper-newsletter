summary: The paper introduces VISTA, a video augmentation framework that synthesizes long-duration and high-resolution video instruction-following pairs from existing video-caption datasets. VISTA improves the performance of large multimodal models on long-video understanding tasks by an average of 3.3% across four benchmarks. It also introduces HRVideoBench, a high-resolution video understanding benchmark, on which the models achieve a 6.5% performance gain....
