summary: This paper explores the impact of using natural language as a guide for monocular depth estimation and finds that current methods perform best with scene-level descriptions and worse with object-centric accuracy. The paper also reveals that these methods are not robust to certain types of attacks and decline in performance with distribution shift. Insights are offered to improve future research in this area....
