summary: Researchers developed Camera Depth Models (CDMs) to enhance depth perception in robots using depth cameras, overcoming challenges like limited accuracy and noise. The resulting CDMs provide nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, enabling robots to generalize seamlessly from simulation to real-world tasks with minimal performance degradation....
