summary: Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO) is an algorithmic framework that improves the training of diffusion-based policies in continuous control and robot learning tasks using the policy gradient method from reinforcement learning. DPPO outperforms other methods for diffusion-based policies and also PG fine-tuning of other policy parameterizations in common benchmarks due to its unique synergies between RL fine-tuning and the diffusion parameterization, leading to structured exploration, sta...
