summary: The study presents a new method called Chain-of-Agents (CoA) that allows language models to solve complex problems using multiple agents within a single model, similar to a multi-agent system. The authors develop a training framework to teach the model this ability and create a type of model called an Agent Foundation Model (AFM), which outperforms existing models in various tasks and is fully open-source for future research....
