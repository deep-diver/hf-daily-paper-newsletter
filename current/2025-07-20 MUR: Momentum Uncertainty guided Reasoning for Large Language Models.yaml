summary: The authors propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), a method to optimize reasoning efficiency in large language models by dynamically allocating thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps. MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy across various benchmarks and model sizes, without requiring additional training....
