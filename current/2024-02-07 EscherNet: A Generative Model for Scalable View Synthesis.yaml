summary: EscherNet is a new model for generating 3D images from multiple reference views. It's scalable and efficient, able to produce over 100 target views simultaneously on a single consumer-grade GPU. It also combines single- and multi-image 3D reconstruction into a single framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks....
