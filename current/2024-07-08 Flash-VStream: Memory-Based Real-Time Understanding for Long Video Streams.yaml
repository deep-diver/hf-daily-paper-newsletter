summary: This paper introduces Flash-VStream, a video-language model that simulates human memory to process extremely long video streams in real-time and respond to user queries simultaneously. It achieves significant reductions in inference latency and VRAM consumption, and outperforms existing models on a new question answering benchmark for online video streaming understanding. The code, models, and datasets are available at the provided URL....
