summary: The authors present LOVE-R1, a model that improves long video understanding by adaptively zooming in on video clips. This model uses a multi-step reasoning process to first view densely sampled frames at a small resolution and then zoom in on frames of interest at a larger resolution, allowing it to better balance temporal understanding and spatial details. Experiments show that LOVE-R1 outperforms a baseline model by an average of 3.1% points across four long video understanding benchmarks....
