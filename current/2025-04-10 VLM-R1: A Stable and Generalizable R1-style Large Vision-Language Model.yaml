summary: The authors propose VLM-R1, a framework that applies reinforcement learning to improve the visual reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. Through experiments and ablation studies, they discover notable insights, such as reward hacking in object detection and the impact of training data quality, which contribute to a better understanding of how reinforcement learning enhances vision-language models....
