summary: The study presents a method to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by allowing them to interact with external environments beyond just language, such as symbolic operators or simulators. The new approach, called ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL), enables LLMs to perform better on tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning, outperforming vocabulary-constrained action baselines....
