summary: The authors present a new method called d^2Cache to improve the speed of diffusion-based language models without compromising their performance. This method uses a two-stage strategy to select and update tokens, allowing for more efficient use of memory and enabling quasi left-to-right generation, which results in faster inference and better generation quality....
