summary: The paper presents a novel pipeline for non-contact sound recovery using event-based cameras, which captures high-frequency signals. It utilizes spatial-temporal information from the event stream, a large training set, and a network that leverages event sparsity and Mamba for temporal information modeling. An imaging system using a laser matrix is also designed to capture event signals caused by sound waves....
