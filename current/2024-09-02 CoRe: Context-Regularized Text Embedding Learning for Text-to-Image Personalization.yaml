summary: The paper proposes a new method for text-to-image personalization called CoRe, which aims to improve the balance between identity preservation and text alignment. CoRe enhances the learning of text embeddings by regularizing context tokens in the prompt, and can be applied to arbitrary prompts without requiring the generation of corresponding images. Experiments show that CoRe outperforms baseline methods in both identity preservation and text alignment....
