summary: This paper presents ConsistI2V, a method to improve visual consistency in image-to-video generation. It uses spatiotemporal attention and noise initialization from the first frame, improving layout, spatial, and motion consistency. Tests on I2V-Bench show that ConsistI2V outperforms other methods....
