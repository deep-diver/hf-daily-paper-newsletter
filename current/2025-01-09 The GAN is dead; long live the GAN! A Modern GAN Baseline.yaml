summary: This paper proposes a new approach to training GANs that addresses issues of mode dropping and non-convergence, and provides a modern GAN baseline. The approach involves using a well-behaved regularized relativistic GAN loss and replacing outdated backbones with modern architectures. The result is a minimalist baseline called R3GAN, which outperforms StyleGAN2 and compares favorably against state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models on various datasets....
