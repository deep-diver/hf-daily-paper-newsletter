summary: The study presents a new method called Gaussian Quant (GQ) that simplifies the process of creating a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) without the need for training. This technique generates random Gaussian noise as a codebook, compares it to the posterior mean, and ensures a small quantization error by meeting a specific constraint. Additionally, the study introduces a heuristic called target divergence constraint (TDC) to improve the training of Gaussian VAEs for GQ, resulting ...
