summary: Researchers created a unified visual encoder called M3Ret for medical image retrieval, which can handle various modalities like X-rays, ultrasounds, videos, and CT scans. By using a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset and self-supervised learning techniques, M3Ret outperforms existing methods and demonstrates strong cross-modal alignment and generalizability to unseen modalities like MRI....
