summary: The paper proposes using GPS tags from photo metadata as a control signal for image generation. They train GPS-to-image models and use them for tasks like generating images based on GPS and text, capturing the unique appearance of different neighborhoods and landmarks. They also extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models, and their evaluations show that GPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based on location, improving estimated 3D structure....
