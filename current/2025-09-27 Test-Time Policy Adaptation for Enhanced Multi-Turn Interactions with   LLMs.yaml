summary: The authors present a new approach called T2PAM that uses user feedback during interactions to improve LLMs' performance in extended conversations. They also introduce ROSA, a lightweight algorithm that implements T2PAM, enabling efficient updates towards an optimal policy with minimal computational overhead, resulting in significantly better task performance....
