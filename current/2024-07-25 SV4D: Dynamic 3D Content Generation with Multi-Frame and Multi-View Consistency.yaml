summary: This paper introduces Stable Video 4D (SV4D), a model that uses a unified diffusion method to generate dynamic 3D objects with consistent multi-frame and multi-view consistency. It can generate new views for each video frame and optimize an implicit 4D representation without the need for cumbersome optimization used in most prior works. SV4D has been trained on a dynamic 3D object dataset and has been shown to outperform prior works in novel-view video synthesis and 4D generation....
