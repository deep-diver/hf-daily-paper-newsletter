summary: The paper presents Harmony, a new framework that solves the problem of synchronized audio-visual content generation in AI by addressing issues like correspondence drift, inefficient attention mechanisms, and intra-modal bias. It introduces a training paradigm, a module for efficient temporal alignment, and a synchronization-enhanced CFG to ensure better audio-visual synchronization, outperforming existing methods in experiments....
