summary: The authors present a new method to improve the realism of video generation for objects like humans and animals by incorporating structure-preserving motion from an autoregressive video model into a diffusion model. Their approach, SAM2VideoX, outperforms previous models in benchmarks and human evaluations by using innovative techniques to capture and align global and local motion patterns....
