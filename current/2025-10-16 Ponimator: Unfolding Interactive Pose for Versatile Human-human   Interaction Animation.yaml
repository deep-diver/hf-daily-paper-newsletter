summary: The researchers created a framework called Ponimator, which uses close-proximity human poses to generate various types of human-human interaction animations, such as image-based and text-to-interaction animations. They trained it using motion-capture interaction datasets and employed two conditional diffusion models to create realistic and dynamic animations, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility in various applications....
