summary: This study presents a novel deep learning model, WAY, which improves the estimation of ship destinations by using global AIS data and a new method that handles long port-to-port trajectories as a nested sequence structure. The model's architecture includes a trajectory representation layer and Channel-Aggregative Sequential Processing (CASP) blocks, which help process the data and provide long-term destination estimates. Additionally, the researchers introduce a new Gradient Dropout technique to...
