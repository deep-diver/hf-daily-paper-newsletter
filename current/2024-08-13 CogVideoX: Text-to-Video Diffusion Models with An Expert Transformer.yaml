summary: CogVideoX is a large-scale diffusion transformer model that generates videos based on text prompts. It uses a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos and an expert transformer with adaptive LayerNorm to improve text-video alignment. The model is trained progressively and has an effective text-video data processing pipeline. It performs well on both machine metrics and human evaluations, and its weights are publicly available....
