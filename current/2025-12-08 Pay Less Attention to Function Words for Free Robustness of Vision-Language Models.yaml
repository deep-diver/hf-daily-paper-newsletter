summary: The authors observe that function words can make vision-language models vulnerable to attacks and propose a method called Function-word De-Attention (FDA) to reduce this impact. FDA calculates the original and function-word cross-attention within attention heads and subtracts the latter from the former, resulting in more aligned and robust models. Experiments show that FDA significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining or slightly improving performance on various tasks, datasets, a...
