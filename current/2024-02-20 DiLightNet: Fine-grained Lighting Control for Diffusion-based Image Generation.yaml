summary: 'This method allows for fine-grained control over lighting during text-driven image generation by using radiance hints and a refined diffusion model called DiLightNet. It involves three stages: generating a provisional image, refining the foreground object with the target lighting, and resynthesizing the background to match the lighting on the foreground....'
