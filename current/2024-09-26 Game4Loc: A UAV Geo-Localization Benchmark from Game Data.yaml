summary: This paper introduces a new method for geo-localizing UAVs using game data. The method involves creating a large-range contiguous area UAV geo-localization dataset named GTA-UAV, which includes multiple flight altitudes, attitudes, scenes, and targets. The paper also introduces a more practical UAV geo-localization task and a weight-based contrastive learning approach for constructing drone-view and satellite-view pairs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for UAV ge...
