summary: The authors present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an efficient 8B parameter model for multimodal large language models, which overcomes training and inference challenges through improvements in model architecture, data strategy, and training method. This model outperforms larger proprietary and open-source models, such as GPT-4o-latest and Qwen2.5-VL 72B, while using significantly less GPU memory and inference time....
