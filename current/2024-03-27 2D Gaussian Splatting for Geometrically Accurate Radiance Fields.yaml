summary: The paper introduces 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), a new way to model and reconstruct the appearance and shape of real-world scenes from multiple images. By using 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks instead of 3D Gaussians, 2DGS provides more accurate and consistent surface representation. 2DGS also utilizes a differentiable renderer that allows for fast and noise-free geometry reconstruction while maintaining high appearance quality and real-time rendering....
