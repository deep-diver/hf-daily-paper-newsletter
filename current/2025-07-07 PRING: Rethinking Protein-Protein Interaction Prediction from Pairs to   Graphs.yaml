summary: The authors present PRING, a new benchmark for predicting protein-protein interactions that evaluates models based on their ability to reconstruct biologically meaningful networks, rather than just isolated pairs. PRING includes a large, high-quality dataset and two evaluation paradigms, and experiments show that current models have limitations in recovering the structural and functional properties of PPI networks....
