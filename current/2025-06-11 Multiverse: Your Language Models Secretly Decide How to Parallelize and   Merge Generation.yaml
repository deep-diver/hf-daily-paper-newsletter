summary: 'The authors present Multiverse, a generative model that allows for parallel generation by utilizing a MapReduce paradigm, which consists of three stages: task decomposition, parallel subtask execution, and result synthesis. Multiverse achieves performance comparable to leading autoregressive language models by efficiently utilizing parallel reasoning steps and enabling dynamic switching between sequential and parallel generation, resulting in up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes....'
