summary: The authors present SWE-smith, a new method for creating large-scale training data for software engineering language models. By using SWE-smith, they generated a dataset of 50,000 instances, which is much larger than previous datasets, and trained a model that achieved state-of-the-art results on a software engineering benchmark. They have open-sourced SWE-smith to make it easier for other researchers to work on language models for automated software engineering....
