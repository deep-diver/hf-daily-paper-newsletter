summary: The authors present a new watermarking method called Lexical Bias Watermarking (LBW) that is specifically designed for autoregressive image generation models, which create images by predicting tokens sequentially. LBW embeds watermarks directly into the token maps, making it resistant to regeneration attacks and secure against white-box attacks, by randomly selecting a green list of tokens for each image and analyzing the token distribution for watermark detection....
