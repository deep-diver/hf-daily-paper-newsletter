summary: Lumina-mGPT is a multimodal autoregressive model that can generate photorealistic images from text descriptions and perform various vision and language tasks. It uses a pretrained decoder-only transformer and is trained on massive interleaved text-image sequences. The model is then fine-tuned on high-quality image-text pairs to improve its image synthesis capabilities. It also has the ability to perform visual recognition tasks and multiturn visual question answering....
