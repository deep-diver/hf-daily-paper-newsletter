summary: GenPRM is a new generative process reward model that improves upon existing PRMs by incorporating explicit Chain-of-Thought reasoning and code verification, and addressing the challenges of limited process supervision and generalization, dependence on scalar value prediction, and inability to scale test-time compute. The model outperforms prior PRMs and demonstrates strong abilities as a critic model for policy model refinement....
