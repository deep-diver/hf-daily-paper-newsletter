summary: This study investigates and enhances the 3D spatial relationship understanding of ViT-based models. It finds that better 3D equivariance leads to improved performance on various downstream tasks, and proposes a finetuning strategy based on 3D correspondences that significantly boosts the 3D correspondence understanding of existing vision models....
