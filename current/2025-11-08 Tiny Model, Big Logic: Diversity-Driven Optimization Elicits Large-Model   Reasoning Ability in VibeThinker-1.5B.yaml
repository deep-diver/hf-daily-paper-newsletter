summary: Researchers developed VibeThinker-1.5B, a small 1.5B-parameter model, using a new method called Spectrum-to-Signal Principle. This model, trained for only $7,800, demonstrates reasoning abilities on par with or better than larger, more expensive models, suggesting that small models can be just as capable as large ones....
