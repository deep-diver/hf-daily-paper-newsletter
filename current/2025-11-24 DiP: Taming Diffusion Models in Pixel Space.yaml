summary: 'The authors present DiP, a new method for efficient pixel space diffusion that resolves the trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency. DiP separates the generation process into two stages: a main stage that uses a special transformer to quickly create the overall structure, and a secondary stage that uses a lightweight model to add detailed features, resulting in faster inference speeds and high-quality generation without relying on a VAE....'
