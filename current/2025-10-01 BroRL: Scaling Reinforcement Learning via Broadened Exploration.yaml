summary: This study proposes a new method called BroRL that improves reinforcement learning by increasing the number of simulations per example, which leads to better performance without the diminishing returns seen in previous methods. The method is based on a mathematical analysis that ensures correct answers are more likely as the number of simulations increases, and experimental results show that it outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks....
