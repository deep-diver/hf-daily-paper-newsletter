summary: This study presents MaskGRPO, a new method that effectively uses rewards to optimize multimodal reinforcement learning in discrete diffusion models. MaskGRPO improves the process by enabling effective importance sampling and adapting to different modalities, resulting in more stable and efficient updates, stronger reasoning performance, and better generation quality....
