summary: This paper introduces FLAMe, a family of large language models trained on a diverse collection of quality assessment tasks. FLAMe improves generalization to a wide variety of held-out tasks, outperforming LLMs trained on proprietary data like GPT-4 and Claude-3 on many tasks. FLAMe can also serve as a powerful starting point for further downstream fine-tuning, with competitive performance on RewardBench. Additionally, a more computationally efficient approach using tail-patch fine-tuning strateg...
