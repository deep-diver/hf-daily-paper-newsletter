summary: A new method called Tiny Recursive Model (TRM) has been developed, which uses a single small neural network with only 2 layers to solve challenging problems like Sudoku and Maze more effectively than a previous approach called Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). TRM, with just 7 million parameters, outperforms most large language models on ARC-AGI tasks while using significantly fewer parameters....
