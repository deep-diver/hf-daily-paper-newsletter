summary: This study explores the issue of diminishing exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) due to the loss of valuable, low-probability tokens, which the authors call 'reasoning sparks'. To tackle this problem, they propose Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg), a method that creates a less-noisy proxy distribution to protect these reasoning sparks, enabling stable training and leading to improved performance on math benchmarks....
