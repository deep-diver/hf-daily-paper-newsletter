summary: VisuLogic is a new benchmark for testing the visual reasoning skills of advanced multimodal models, which are models that can understand and process information from both text and images. This benchmark consists of 1,000 human-verified problems across six categories, such as quantitative shifts, spatial relations, and attribute comparisons. The results of testing leading models on this benchmark show that they struggle with visual reasoning, scoring below 30% accuracy, while humans achieve 51.4%...
