summary: The study addresses the issue of 'dominant modality bias' in vision-language models, where they rely too much on one modality for predictions. The researchers propose a new framework, BalGrad, to mitigate this bias, including techniques like inter-modality gradient reweighting and inter-task gradient projection. Experiments on various datasets confirm that BalGrad effectively reduces over-reliance on specific modalities....
