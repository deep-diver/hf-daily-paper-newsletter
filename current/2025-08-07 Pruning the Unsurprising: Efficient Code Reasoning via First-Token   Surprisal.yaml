summary: The authors present a new method called ASAP for compressing Chain-of-Thought reasoning in Large Reasoning Models, which improves efficiency and reduces costs in code generation tasks. ASAP first uses anchor-guided pruning to keep the main structure of the reasoning process and then removes unnecessary steps based on a new metric, resulting in faster and cheaper model training and inference without sacrificing accuracy....
