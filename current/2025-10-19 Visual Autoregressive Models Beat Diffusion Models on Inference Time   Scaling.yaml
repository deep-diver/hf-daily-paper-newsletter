summary: The study finds that visual autoregressive models, with their discrete and sequential nature, are more effective than diffusion models for image generation when using search strategies. The researchers demonstrate that a smaller autoregressive model can outperform a larger diffusion model, offering insights into the importance of model architecture in inference-time optimization for visual generation....
