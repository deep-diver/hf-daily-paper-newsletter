summary: This study presents ReflectDrive, a new framework for autonomous driving that uses a reflection mechanism and discrete diffusion to generate safe trajectories. By discretizing the driving space and utilizing pre-trained models, ReflectDrive can plan and correct paths without expensive gradient calculations, improving safety and efficiency in complex real-world environments....
