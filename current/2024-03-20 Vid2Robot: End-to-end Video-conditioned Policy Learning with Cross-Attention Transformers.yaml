summary: This paper proposes Vid2Robot, a novel end-to-end video-based learning framework for robots that can directly produce robot actions given a video demonstration of a manipulation task and current visual observations. The model uses cross-attention mechanisms and auxiliary contrastive losses to improve policy performance and has been tested on real-world robots, resulting in a 20% improvement in performance compared to other video-conditioned policies....
