summary: The paper introduces MAVIS, a new way to train large language models to better solve math problems in visual contexts. They do this by creating new datasets and training stages that focus on improving the model's visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and mathematical reasoning skills. The paper also provides data and models for others to use....
