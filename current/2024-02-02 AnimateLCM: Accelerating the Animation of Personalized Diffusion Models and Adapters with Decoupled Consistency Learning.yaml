summary: We present AnimateLCM, a method to accelerate the animation of personalized diffusion models and adapters with decoupled consistency learning, improving training efficiency and quality, and enabling adaptive use of plug-and-play adapters while maintaining sampling speed. The proposed strategy achieves top-performing results in image-conditioned and layout-conditioned video generation tasks. Code and weights will be made public; more details available at <https://github.com/G-U-N/AnimateLCM>....
