summary: We present AnimateLCM, a method to accelerate the animation of personalized
  diffusion models and adapters with decoupled consistency learning, improving training
  efficiency and quality, and enabling adaptive use of plug-and-play adapters while
  maintaining sampling speed. The proposed strategy achieves top-performing results
  in image-conditioned and layout-conditioned video generation tasks. Code and weights
  will be made public; more details available at <https://github.com/G-U-N/AnimateLCM>....
