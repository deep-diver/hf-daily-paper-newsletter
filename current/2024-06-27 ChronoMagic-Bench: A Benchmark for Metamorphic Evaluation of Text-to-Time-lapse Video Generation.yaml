summary: We propose a new benchmark called ChronoMagic-Bench to evaluate text-to-video models' ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark includes 1,649 prompts and real-world videos, categorized into four major types, and we introduce two new automatic metrics to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence. Based on the benchmark, we conduct manual evaluations of ten representative models, revealing their stre...
