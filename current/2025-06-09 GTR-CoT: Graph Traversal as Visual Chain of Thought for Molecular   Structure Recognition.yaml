summary: The study presents GTR-Mol-VLM, a new framework for converting molecular images into machine-readable formats, which uses a unique mechanism to mimic human reasoning in parsing complex molecular structures and addresses inconsistencies in annotations. The framework outperforms other models in evaluations, especially in recognizing functional group abbreviations, and is expected to advance cheminformatics and AI for Science....
