summary: This paper proposes a modular approach to building large language models (LLMs) by breaking them down into smaller, functional modules called 'bricks'. The modular approach allows for more efficient and scalable foundation models, and the paper discusses the construction, utilization, and limitations of these configurable foundation models. The paper also presents four brick-oriented operations for dynamic configuration of LLMs based on instructions to handle complex tasks. The paper highlights ...
