summary: This study explores the potential of Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) in improving visual intelligence by pretraining on spatiotemporal data, which helps them understand structure and dynamics. The research shows that VDMs adapt more efficiently to various visual tasks compared to language models, suggesting that video pretraining could lead to more advanced visual foundation models....
