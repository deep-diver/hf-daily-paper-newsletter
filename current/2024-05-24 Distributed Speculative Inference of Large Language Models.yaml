summary: Distributed Speculative Inference (DSI) is a new algorithm that speeds up the inference of large language models (LLMs) and is faster than traditional autoregressive inference and other speculative inference methods. It works on frozen LLMs without any training or architectural modifications and can support LLMs that cannot be accelerated with other methods....
