summary: The authors present a new method called CodePlot-CoT that uses visual aids to improve mathematical reasoning in AI models. They created a large dataset of math problems with visual reasoning and developed a code-to-image converter to generate precise visual thought for solving these problems. The resulting model outperforms existing ones by up to 21% and the authors make their datasets and models publicly available for future research....
