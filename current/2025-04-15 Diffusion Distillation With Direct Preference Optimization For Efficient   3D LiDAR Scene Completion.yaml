summary: This research presents Distillation-DPO, a novel framework that combines diffusion distillation and direct preference optimization to improve 3D LiDAR scene completion. By generating paired completion scenes with different initial noises, constructing winning and losing sample pairs based on LiDAR scene evaluation metrics, and optimizing the student model using the difference in score functions between the teacher and student models, Distillation-DPO achieves higher-quality scene completion and ...
