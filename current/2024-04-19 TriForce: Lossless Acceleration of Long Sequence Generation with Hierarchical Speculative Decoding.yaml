summary: This paper proposes TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that improves the efficiency of long sequence generation with large language models by using a smaller model to reduce the latency of drafting. TriForce achieves impressive speedups and scalability, and outperforms other compression methods in handling long contexts while maintaining high generation quality....
