summary: A new recommendation model called Wukong, based on stacked factorization machines and a synergistic upscaling strategy, is proposed to establish a scaling law in the domain of recommendation. Wukong consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in quality and holds the scaling law across two orders of magnitude in model complexity....
