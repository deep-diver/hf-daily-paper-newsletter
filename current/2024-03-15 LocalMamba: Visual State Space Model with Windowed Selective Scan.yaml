summary: The paper introduces a new method called LocalMamba that improves the performance of Vision Mamba (ViM) by dividing images into distinct windows to capture local dependencies while maintaining a global perspective. They also propose a dynamic method to search for the optimal scan choices for each layer. Extensive experiments show their approach is more effective in capturing image representations....
