summary: The paper introduces a new method called LocalMamba that improves the performance
  of Vision Mamba (ViM) by dividing images into distinct windows to capture local
  dependencies while maintaining a global perspective. They also propose a dynamic
  method to search for the optimal scan choices for each layer. Extensive experiments
  show their approach is more effective in capturing image representations....
