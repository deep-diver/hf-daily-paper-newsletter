summary: We present a new method for making text-to-image models, called Diffusion Transformers (DiT), understand and focus on specific areas of an image. This is done by creating noisy bits of the image that represent each specific area, and then placing these bits back into the image at each step to make sure the model pays attention to the right spots. Our method works better than previous ones on two different image datasets....
