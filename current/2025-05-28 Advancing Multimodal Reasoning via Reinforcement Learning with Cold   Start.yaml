summary: The study explores improving multimodal reasoning in large language models by combining supervised fine-tuning with structured chain-of-thought patterns and reinforcement learning. The two-stage approach significantly outperforms single-method models, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source multimodal language models at different scales....
