summary: This paper presents SliceGPT, a new method for compressing large language models by replacing weight matrices with smaller ones, reducing computation and memory demands while maintaining performance. The method can remove up to 25% of the model parameters and run faster on less powerful GPUs, with a new insight on computational invariance in transformer networks that can inspire future advances in compression....
