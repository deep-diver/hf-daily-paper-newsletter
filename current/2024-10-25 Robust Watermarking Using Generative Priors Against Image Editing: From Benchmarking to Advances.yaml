summary: 'This paper presents a new watermarking method called VINE that is more robust against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. It uses two innovations: analyzing frequency characteristics of image editing and using a large-scale pretrained diffusion model for more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. The method outperforms existing methods in both image quality and robustness....'
