summary: This study examines the effectiveness of token-wise entropy and model-as-judge (MASJ) in estimating uncertainty for multiple-choice question-answering tasks using three LLMs (Phi-4, Mistral, and Qwen). Results show that response entropy predicts model error in knowledge-heavy domains like biology, while MASJ performs similarly to a random error predictor. The study also reveals that data-uncertainty related entropy should be considered in uncertainty estimates frameworks, and MASU requires impro...
