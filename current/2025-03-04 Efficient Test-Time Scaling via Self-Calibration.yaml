summary: This work proposes a solution to improve the efficiency of test-time scaling in large language models by using model confidence of responses, as traditional methods like Best-of-N and Self-Consistency with majority voting can waste computation. The proposed Self-Calibration distills confidence from Self-Consistency into the model itself, enabling reliable confidence estimation with one forward pass, and then using confidence-based methods like Early-Stopping for Best-of-N and Self-Consistency wi...
