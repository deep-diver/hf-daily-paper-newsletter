summary: This study demonstrates a new method to use video diffusion models for point tracking without prior training. By placing a colored marker at the point of interest and regenerating the video, the model can trace the point's trajectory even through occlusions, outperforming other zero-shot methods and competing with specialized self-supervised models....
