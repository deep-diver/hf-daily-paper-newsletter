summary: This paper proposes a new method called CLOC (Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training) to improve the localization capability of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training). CLOC uses region-text contrastive loss and modules to generate image embeddings that can be easily transformed into region representations. The method is designed to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale and can be used to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks....
