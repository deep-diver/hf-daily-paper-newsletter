summary: This paper proposes RAPL, a method for learning visual rewards for visuomotor robot policies from less human preference feedback by aligning pre-trained vision encoders with the end-user's visual representation and constructing a dense visual reward via feature matching in the aligned representation space. RAPL is validated through simulation and hardware experiments, demonstrating efficient use of preference data and generalization across robot embodiments....
