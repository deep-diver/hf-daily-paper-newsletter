summary: The authors present a new method, START, to improve multimodal large language models' understanding of charts by focusing on both their visual layout and data details. They introduce two new tasks, chart-element grounding and chart-to-code generation, and create a novel dataset, START-Dataset, to train models in these tasks. The proposed method outperforms existing models and demonstrates consistent improvements across different model sizes and benchmarks....
