summary: The paper presents MusicHiFi, a high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder that converts low-resolution mel-spectrograms to high-quality audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio, and upmixes to stereophonic audio using a cascade of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The approach yields better audio quality, faster inference speed, and better spatialization control compared to previous work....
