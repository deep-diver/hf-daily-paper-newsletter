summary: The researchers created RecTok to improve high-dimensional visual tokenizers by focusing on the forward flow in flow matching, making it semantically rich and distilling information from vision foundation models into this flow. RecTok outperforms previous methods in image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance, achieving state-of-the-art results and improving with increased latent dimensionality....
