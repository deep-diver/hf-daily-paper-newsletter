summary: This paper explores the integration of quantum machine learning and variational quantum circuits to augment the efficacy of diffusion-based image generation models. The authors introduce two quantum diffusion models and benchmark them against classical models, showing superior performance in terms of FID, SSIM, and PSNR. They also introduce a single sampling architecture that combines the diffusion procedure into a single step, enabling fast one-step image generation....
