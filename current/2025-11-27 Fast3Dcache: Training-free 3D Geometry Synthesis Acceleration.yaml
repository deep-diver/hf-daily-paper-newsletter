summary: The researchers present a method called Fast3Dcache that speeds up the generation of 3D shapes using diffusion models without sacrificing quality. This is achieved by introducing two new techniques, Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint and Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion, which help maintain the accuracy of the generated shapes while significantly reducing computation time and resources....
