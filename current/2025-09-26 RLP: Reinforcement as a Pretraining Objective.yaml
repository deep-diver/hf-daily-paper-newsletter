summary: This study proposes RLP, a new pretraining objective that brings reinforcement learning's exploration aspect to the pretraining phase of large reasoning models. RLP encourages models to think independently before predicting the next token, which significantly improves performance on reasoning-heavy tasks and demonstrates scalability across different architectures and model sizes....
