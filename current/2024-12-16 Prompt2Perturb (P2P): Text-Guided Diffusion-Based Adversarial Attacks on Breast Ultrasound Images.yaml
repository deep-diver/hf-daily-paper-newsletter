summary: We present Prompt2Perturb (P2P), a new approach to generating adversarial attacks on breast ultrasound images using text instructions. Our method uses learnable prompts and optimizes early reverse diffusion steps to create subtle, yet effective, perturbations that remain imperceptible while guiding the model towards targeted outcomes. P2P outperforms existing attack techniques and generates more natural-looking images....
