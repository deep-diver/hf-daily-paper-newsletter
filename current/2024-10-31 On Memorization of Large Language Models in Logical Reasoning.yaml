summary: This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) solve logical reasoning problems by memorizing them or by actual reasoning. The study uses a benchmark based on Knights and Knaves puzzles and finds that fine-tuning LLMs leads to heavy memorization of training puzzles, but also improves their generalization performance. The study suggests that LLMs exhibit a complex interplay between memorization and genuine reasoning abilities, and provides insights into how LLMs switch between reaso...
