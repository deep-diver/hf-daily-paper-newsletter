summary: The paper presents an iterative self-training approach using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for improving code generation by training a reranker model to select the best solution from multiple sampled outputs. The proposed method, evaluated on the MultiPL-E dataset, outperforms a larger model in generation quality and speed while achieving performance comparable to GPT-4....
