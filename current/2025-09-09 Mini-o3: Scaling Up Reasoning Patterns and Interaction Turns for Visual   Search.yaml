summary: This study presents Mini-o3, a system that significantly improves visual search performance by scaling up tool-based interactions and executing deep, multi-turn reasoning. The system's success is attributed to a new dataset of complex visual search problems, an iterative data collection pipeline, and an over-turn masking strategy that enables efficient training and scalable inference, resulting in rich reasoning patterns and improved accuracy....
