summary: This study presents a new sparse attention method called MoGA that efficiently matches tokens without relying on blockwise estimation, enabling effective long-range interactions in video generation. The researchers use MoGA to create an efficient model that can generate high-quality, long videos at a rapid frame rate, which is validated through various experiments....
