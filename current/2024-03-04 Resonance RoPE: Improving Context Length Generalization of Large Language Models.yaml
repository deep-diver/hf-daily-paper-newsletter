summary: This paper proposes a method called Resonance RoPE to improve the performance of large language models on longer sequences, specifically addressing challenges in train-short-test-long scenarios. The method refines the interpolation of RoPE features for out-of-distribution token positions and shows improved results on both synthetic tasks and downstream long-text applications....
