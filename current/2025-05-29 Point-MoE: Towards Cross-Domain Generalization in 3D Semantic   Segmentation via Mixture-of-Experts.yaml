summary: The authors present Point-MoE, a new architecture for 3D perception that can handle diverse sources of 3D data without needing domain labels. This approach improves cross-domain generalization in 3D semantic segmentation, outperforming other multi-domain methods and offering a scalable solution for 3D understanding....
