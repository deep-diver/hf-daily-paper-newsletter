summary: This study proposes a benchmark called ENACT to assess embodied cognition in modern vision-language models, which are typically trained without considering physical interaction. ENACT evaluates models' abilities in tasks like affordance recognition and action-effect reasoning through a visual question answering format, revealing a performance gap between models and humans, especially in long-horizon tasks....
