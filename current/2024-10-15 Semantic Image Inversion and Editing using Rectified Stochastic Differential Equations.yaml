summary: This paper proposes a new method for inverting and editing images using rectified flow models, which offer a promising alternative to diffusion models. The method uses dynamic optimal control and proves that the resulting vector field is equivalent to a rectified stochastic differential equation. The method outperforms prior works in zero-shot inversion and editing, and large-scale human evaluations confirm user preference....
