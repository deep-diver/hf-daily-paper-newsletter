summary: The abstract introduces U-MATH, a new benchmark for evaluating mathematical skills in language models, which consists of 1,100 unpublished open-ended university-level problems. The benchmark is balanced across six core subjects and includes 20% multimodal problems. The evaluation of various language models on U-MATH reveals that they struggle with both text-based and visual problems, achieving a maximum accuracy of only 63% and 45% respectively. The solution assessment is also challenging for la...
