summary: The study presents a novel decoding strategy, phi-Decoding, to balance exploration and exploitation in auto-regressive generation. It approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering, then samples from the joint distribution to select optimal steps for exploitation, and includes in-width and in-depth pruning strategies for adaptive computation allocation, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency across seven benchmarks....
