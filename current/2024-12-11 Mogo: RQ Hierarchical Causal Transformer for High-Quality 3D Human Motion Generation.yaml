summary: The paper introduces Mogo, a new architecture for generating high-quality 3D human motions. It uses a hierarchical residual vector quantization variational autoencoder and a hierarchical causal transformer to generate continuous and cyclic motion sequences up to 13 seconds, outperforming existing models in terms of quality and out-of-distribution generation....
