summary: We find that instruction-response pairs are not necessary for instruction following, as pretrained models have an instruction-response mapping that can be revealed by teaching the model the desired distribution of responses. We also find that it's not necessary to teach the desired distribution of responses, as instruction-response training on narrow-domain data still leads to broad instruction-following behavior. We hypothesize that simple changes to a language model's distribution can yield in...
