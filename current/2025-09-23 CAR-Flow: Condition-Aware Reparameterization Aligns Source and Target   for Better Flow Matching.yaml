summary: The study presents CAR-Flow, a new method for condition-aware reparameterization that aligns source and target distributions to improve flow matching in conditional generative modeling. By shifting these distributions, CAR-Flow reduces the complexity of the model, leading to faster training and better performance, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in FID score on ImageNet-256 data....
