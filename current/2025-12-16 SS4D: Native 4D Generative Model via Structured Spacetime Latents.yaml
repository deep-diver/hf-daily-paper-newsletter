summary: The authors propose a new method called SS4D that creates realistic moving 3D objects from single-view videos, directly training on 4D data for better detail, smooth transitions, and structural integrity. They tackle the lack of 4D training data by using a pre-existing 2D-to-3D model, ensure smooth motion with special layers that consider multiple frames, and compress the data for efficient processing, all while designing a training strategy to handle occlusions....
