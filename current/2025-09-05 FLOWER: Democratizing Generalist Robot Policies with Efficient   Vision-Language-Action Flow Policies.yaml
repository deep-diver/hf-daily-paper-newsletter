summary: Researchers have created an efficient Vision-Language-Action policy called FLOWER, which uses less computational power and resources compared to current methods. FLOWER performs well across various tasks and robotic embodiments, even setting a new state-of-the-art on a benchmark, and its code and pretrained weights are available for use....
