summary: This study explores a new approach called test-time interaction scaling, which enhances agents' ability to interact with their environment by allowing more exploration, backtracking, and dynamic re-planning within a single action sequence. The proposed method, TTI, significantly improves web agent performance on various benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of this new scaling dimension to create more adaptive and effective agents....
