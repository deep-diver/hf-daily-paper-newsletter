summary: PIIP is a novel network architecture that uses pretrained models to process multi-scale images and integrates information from different spatial scales for visual perception and multimodal understanding. It achieves superior performance compared to single-branch and existing multi-resolution approaches with lower computational cost, and can improve the performance of large-scale vision foundation models like InternViT-6B by 1%-2% on detection and segmentation with only 40%-60% of the original co...
