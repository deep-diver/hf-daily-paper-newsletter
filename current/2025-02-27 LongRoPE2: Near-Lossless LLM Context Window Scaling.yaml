summary: 'LongRoPE2 is a new method that increases the context window of pre-trained large language models, improving their performance on longer sequences while maintaining their performance on shorter sequences. This is accomplished through three key contributions: a hypothesis on the insufficient training in higher RoPE dimensions, an effective RoPE rescaling algorithm, and a mixed context window training approach. Experiments show that LongRoPE2 achieves a 128K effective context length with LLaMA3-8B ...'
