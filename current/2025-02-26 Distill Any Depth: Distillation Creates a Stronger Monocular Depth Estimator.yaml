summary: This research analyzes the impact of various depth normalization strategies on distillation for monocular depth estimation (MDE). The proposed Cross-Context Distillation method uses global and local depth cues to improve pseudo-label quality and a multi-teacher distillation framework to enhance depth prediction accuracy, outperforming existing methods....
