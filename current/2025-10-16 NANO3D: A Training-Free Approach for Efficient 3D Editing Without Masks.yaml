summary: The authors present Nano3D, a new method for efficient 3D object editing without masks, which improves upon existing techniques by providing better consistency and visual quality. Nano3D does not require training and is based on a framework that integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS and introduces Voxel/Slat-Merge strategies, resulting in high-quality edits that preserve the structure of unedited areas. The authors also create the largest 3D editing dataset, Nano3D-Edit-100k, to support further resea...
