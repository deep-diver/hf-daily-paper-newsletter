summary: This research presents a new method called Low-Rank Clone (LRC) to create efficient small language models (SLMs) that perform as well as larger models, while using significantly fewer training tokens. LRC achieves this by compressing weights and aligning activations, resulting in over 1,000 times faster training compared to state-of-the-art models....
