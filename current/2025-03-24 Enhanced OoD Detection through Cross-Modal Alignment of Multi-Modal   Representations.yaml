summary: This study explores the potential of multi-modal fine-tuning (MMFT) for out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) and provides a solution for better utilizing pretrained textual information by aligning similar semantics from different modalities more closely in the hyperspherical representation space, achieving state-of-the-art OoDD performance....
