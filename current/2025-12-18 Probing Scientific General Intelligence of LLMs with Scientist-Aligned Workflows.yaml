summary: 'The authors propose a new way to measure a machine''s ability to perform scientific tasks, called SGI, by creating a benchmark with four tasks: deep research, idea generation, experiments, and reasoning. They find that current large language models struggle with these tasks, especially in generating feasible ideas and accurately executing experiments, and introduce a new method to improve hypothesis generation....'
