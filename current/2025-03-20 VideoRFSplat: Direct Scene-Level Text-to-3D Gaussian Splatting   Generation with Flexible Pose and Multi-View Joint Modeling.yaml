summary: VideoRFSplat is a text-to-3D model that generates realistic 3D models for scenes using a video generation model. It proposes a dual-stream architecture to jointly model multi-view images and camera poses, and an asynchronous sampling strategy to improve cross-modal consistency and reduce ambiguity....
