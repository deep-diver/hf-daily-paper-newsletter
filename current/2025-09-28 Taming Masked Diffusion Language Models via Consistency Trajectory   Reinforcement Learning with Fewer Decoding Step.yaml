summary: This study explores and improves decoding strategies and reinforcement learning algorithms for masked diffusion language models (MDLMs), which offer benefits like parallel decoding and fewer inference steps compared to autoregressive language models. The research introduces EOS Early Rejection, Ascending Step-Size decoding scheduler, and Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization to optimize MDLMs' performance, reduce optimization errors, and achieve competitive results with fewer...
