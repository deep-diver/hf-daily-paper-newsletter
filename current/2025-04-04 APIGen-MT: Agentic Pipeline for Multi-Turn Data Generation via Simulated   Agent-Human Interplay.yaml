summary: 'The authors present APIGen-MT, a method to generate high-quality data for training AI agents in multi-turn interactions. This data is created through a two-phase process: first, a committee of LLM reviewers and feedback loops generate task blueprints with ground-truth actions; second, these blueprints are transformed into complete interaction trajectories with simulated human-agent interplay. The resulting models, xLAM-2-fc-r series, outperform other frontier models in multi-turn settings while ...'
