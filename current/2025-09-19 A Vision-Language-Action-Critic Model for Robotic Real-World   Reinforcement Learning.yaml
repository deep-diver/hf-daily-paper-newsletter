summary: The authors present a model called VLAC that improves robotic real-world reinforcement learning by using vision-language data and robot/human trajectory data to create a general process reward model. This model allows for efficient exploration, eliminates the need for task-specific reward engineering, and significantly increases success rates in various manipulation tasks with the help of a human-in-the-loop protocol....
