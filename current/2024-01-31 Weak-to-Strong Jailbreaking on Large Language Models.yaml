summary: The paper proposes a new attack method called weak-to-strong jailbreaking, which allows adversaries to use smaller, already-trained language models to guide their attack against much larger language models, making jailbreaking faster and more efficient. The paper also suggests a defense strategy to protect against this attack but acknowledges that creating more effective defenses is still challenging....
