summary: Synth-SONAR is a new sonar image synthesis framework that uses diffusion models and GPT prompting to generate high-quality, diverse, and realistic sonar images from textual prompts. It also uses style injection techniques and a large sonar data corpus to improve the quality and diversity of the synthesized images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time GPT-prompting has been applied to sonar imagery....
