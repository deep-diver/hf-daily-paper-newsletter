summary: This paper introduces Generalized Instruction Tuning (GLAN), a method that generates large-scale synthetic instruction data across all disciplines using a pre-curated taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities. It allows large language models (LLMs) to excel in various tasks without the need for task-specific training data, and it can be easily customized by adding new nodes to the taxonomy....
