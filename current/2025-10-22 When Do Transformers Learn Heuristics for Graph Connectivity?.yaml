summary: This study explores why Transformers often rely on unreliable shortcuts instead of learning generalizable algorithms. Using graph connectivity as an example, the research shows that a simplified Transformer model can solve graphs up to a certain complexity level, and the model learns different strategies based on the complexity of the training graphs. The findings suggest that limiting the training data to the model's capacity can help it learn the correct algorithm instead of a less efficient s...
