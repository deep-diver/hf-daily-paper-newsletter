summary: This paper proposes a novel approach called FnCTOD for solving dialogue state tracking in task-oriented dialogues using large language models through function calling. The method improves zero-shot dialogue state tracking and allows adaptation to diverse domains without extensive data collection or model tuning. The approach achieves exceptional performance with both modestly sized open-source and proprietary large language models, and the authors plan to open-source experimental code and model....
