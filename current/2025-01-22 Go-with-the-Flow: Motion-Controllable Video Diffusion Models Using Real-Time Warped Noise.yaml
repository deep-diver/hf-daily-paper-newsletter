summary: The paper introduces a new method for controlling motion in video diffusion models by replacing random noise with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields. This method is fast enough to run in real time and can be used to control local object motion, global camera movement, and motion transfer. It maintains per-frame pixel quality while providing effective motion control. The method is agnostic to diffusion model design and requires no changes to model architectures or training p...
