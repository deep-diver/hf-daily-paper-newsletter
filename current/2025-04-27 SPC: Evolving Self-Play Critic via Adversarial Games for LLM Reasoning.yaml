summary: The study presents a new method called Self-Play Critic (SPC) that enhances the ability of a model to evaluate the correctness of reasoning steps in large language models without requiring manual annotation. SPC uses two copies of a base model to play adversarial games, with one model trying to produce errors and the other trying to detect them, and the models improve through reinforcement learning. Experiments show that SPC significantly improves error detection and mathematical reasoning perfo...
