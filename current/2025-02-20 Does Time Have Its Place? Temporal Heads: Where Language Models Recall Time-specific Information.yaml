summary: The study explores how language models handle time-specific facts. It identifies specific attention heads, called Temporal Heads, that are primarily responsible for processing temporal knowledge. These heads are present across multiple models but their locations and responses can vary. Disabling these heads impairs the model's ability to recall time-specific information without affecting its general capabilities or time-invariant knowledge....
