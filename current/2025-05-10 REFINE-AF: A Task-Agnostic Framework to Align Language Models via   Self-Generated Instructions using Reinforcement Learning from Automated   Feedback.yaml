summary: This study evaluates three open-source small LLMs using a semi-automated framework to generate instruction datasets, reducing human intervention and costs. The researchers also show that incorporating a Reinforcement Learning-based training algorithm into this framework leads to significant improvements in most tasks compared to previous approaches....
