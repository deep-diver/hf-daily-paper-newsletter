summary: The authors present CoSPlan, a benchmark for evaluating visual sequential planning in large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across four domains, focusing on error detection and correction. They also introduce SGI, a training-free method that improves VLMs' reasoning abilities in sequential planning tasks, resulting in a 5.2% average performance gain....
