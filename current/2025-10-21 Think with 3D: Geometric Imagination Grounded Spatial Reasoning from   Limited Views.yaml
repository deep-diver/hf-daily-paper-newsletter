summary: The authors present 3DThinker, a novel framework that improves 3D spatial reasoning from limited views by leveraging geometric information within images. Unlike previous methods, 3DThinker enables 3D mental imagery during reasoning without requiring 3D prior input or explicit 3D labels, and it outperforms strong baselines in various benchmarks....
