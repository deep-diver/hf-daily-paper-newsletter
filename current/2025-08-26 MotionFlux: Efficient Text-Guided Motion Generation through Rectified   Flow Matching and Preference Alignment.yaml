summary: The authors present a new method called TAPO that improves alignment between text descriptions and motion semantics, and a high-speed generation framework named MotionFLUX that enables real-time synthesis by reducing the need for multi-step sampling. These two techniques together create a unified system that outperforms current methods in terms of semantic consistency, motion quality, and generation speed....
