summary: The authors present Matrix-Game 2.0, a real-time, streaming interactive world model that generates high-quality videos quickly by using a few-step auto-regressive diffusion process. This model is built with a scalable data production pipeline, an action injection module for frame-level inputs, and a few-step distillation based on the causal architecture, enabling it to simulate complex physical dynamics and interactive behaviors in real-time....
