summary: The proposed LanDiff model combines the strengths of language models and diffusion models for video generation, addressing their individual limitations through a coarse-to-fine generation approach. It introduces innovations like a semantic tokenizer, a language model for semantic tokens, and a streaming diffusion model, resulting in superior performance in T2V benchmarks and long video generation compared to other models....
