summary: It's hard for computers to identify breathing problems from sounds because there isn't much clean data to learn from. A new technique helps these computers learn smarter by finding more stable ways to solve the problem, rather than just memorizing answers, significantly improving their ability to accurately detect real issues in new patients and critical conditions....
