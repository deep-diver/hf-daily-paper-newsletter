summary: This study presents a new method for reducing noise in depth images captured by ToF sensors, which improves both how well the images match over time and how sharp they are. The method uses a graph-based approach to focus on consistent parts of the images across frames, resulting in more accurate and reliable depth information. The proposed technique outperforms existing methods and is effective on both synthetic and real-world datasets....
