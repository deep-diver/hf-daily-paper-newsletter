summary: The study presents a new method called PRFL that uses pre-trained video generation models for reward modeling in noisy latent spaces, which is more efficient and effective than existing methods that operate on pixel-space inputs. PRFL enables optimization in latent space, reducing memory consumption and training time while improving alignment with human preferences for video generation....
