summary: The authors present Dr.V, a framework that helps detect and diagnose hallucinations in large video models by using a benchmark dataset and a satellite video agent. Dr.V-Bench, the dataset, contains 10,000 instances with detailed spatial-temporal annotations, while Dr.V-Agent identifies hallucinations through a step-by-step process that mimics human video comprehension, improving interpretability and reliability in real-world scenarios....
