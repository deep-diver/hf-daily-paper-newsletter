summary: This paper proposes a new method for image and video generation using LLM architecture. It directly models images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Evaluation shows that this approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines, and it has an especial advantage in generating long-tail visual elements....
