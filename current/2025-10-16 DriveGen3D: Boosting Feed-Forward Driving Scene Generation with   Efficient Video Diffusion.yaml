summary: The authors propose a new system called DriveGen3D that creates realistic and controllable 3D driving scenes, solving problems in current methods like high computational demands or lack of 3D representation. DriveGen3D combines two components, FastDrive-DiT for efficient video generation and FastRecon3D for quick 3D scene reconstruction, enabling real-time generation of extended driving videos and dynamic 3D scenes with high quality and parameter efficiency....
