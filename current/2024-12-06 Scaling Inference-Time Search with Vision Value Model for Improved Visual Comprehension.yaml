summary: This paper introduces a new model called Vision Value Model (VisVM) that helps vision-language models (VLMs) generate better responses by guiding their search process during inference. VisVM evaluates the quality of sentences and predicts the quality of future sentences, which helps VLMs avoid generating incorrect or incomplete sentences. The paper shows that using VisVM improves the performance of VLMs on various multimodal benchmarks and can be used to train VLMs to improve themselves....
