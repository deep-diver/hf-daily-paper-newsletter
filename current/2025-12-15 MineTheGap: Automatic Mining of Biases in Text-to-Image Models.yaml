summary: The study presents MineTheGap, a method that uses a genetic algorithm to find prompts which cause Text-to-Image models to generate biased outputs. This tool is different from others because it not only finds bias in a given prompt but also gets better at finding biases through an optimization process, which helps in reducing societal impacts and improving user experience....
