summary: The study presents a method called Adaptive Computation Pruning (ACP) for the Forgetting Transformer (FoX), which reduces computational cost by dynamically pruning input-output dependencies that are decayed by the forget gate. The use of ACP in language model pretraining leads to significant reductions in FLOPs and improved training throughput without performance loss....
