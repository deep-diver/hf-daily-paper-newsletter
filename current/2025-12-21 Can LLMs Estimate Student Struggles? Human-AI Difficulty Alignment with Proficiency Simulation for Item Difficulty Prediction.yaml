summary: This study examines if large language models can accurately estimate the difficulty of questions or tasks for human learners, finding that bigger models don't necessarily improve accuracy and that models struggle to simulate the limitations of students, suggesting that general problem-solving skills don't guarantee understanding of human cognitive struggles....
