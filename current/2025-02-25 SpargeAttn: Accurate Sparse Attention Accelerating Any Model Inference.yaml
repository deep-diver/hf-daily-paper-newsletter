summary: The authors propose SpargeAttn, a universal sparse and quantized attention mechanism that accelerates model inference across various domains without compromising performance. SpargeAttn achieves this by employing a two-stage online filter to predict and skip certain attention map computations, significantly speeding up diverse models such as language, image, and video generation models....
