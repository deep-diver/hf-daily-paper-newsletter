summary: This study introduces Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling (GIMM), a new and improved approach to motion modeling for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI). GIMM uses a motion encoding pipeline to model spatiotemporal motion latent from bidirectional flows, and an adaptive coordinate-based neural network to predict optical flows within two adjacent input frames. GIMM performs better than the current state of the art on VFI benchmarks....
