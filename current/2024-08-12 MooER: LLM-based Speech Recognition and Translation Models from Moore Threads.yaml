summary: This paper presents MooER, a LLM-based large-scale automatic speech recognition and translation model trained on a 5000-hour pseudo labeled dataset. It achieves performance comparable to other open source models trained on hundreds of thousands of hours of labeled speech data and outperforms other open source Speech LLMs on the Covost2 Zh2en testset, with a BLEU score of 25.2. The paper's main contributions include a training strategy for speech related tasks using small amounts of pseudo labele...
