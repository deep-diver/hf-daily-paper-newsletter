summary: This paper introduces a new token-level selection scheme called Multi-Draft Speculative Sampling, which uses importance sampling (IS) and single-draft speculative sampling to increase the probability of accepting a valid token. The authors also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the acceptance probability to equal one and an explicit expression for the optimal acceptance probability. Experimental results show improvements in block efficiency and token rates compared to baseline sch...
