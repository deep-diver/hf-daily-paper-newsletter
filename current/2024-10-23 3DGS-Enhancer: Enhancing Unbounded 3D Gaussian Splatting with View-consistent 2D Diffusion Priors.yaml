summary: This paper introduces a method called 3DGS-Enhancer that improves the quality of 3D images created from sparse input views by using 2D video diffusion priors to address the issue of insufficient information in under-sampled areas, which often results in noticeable artifacts. The method restores view-consistent latent features of rendered novel views and integrates them with the input views through a spatial-temporal decoder, and the enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS mode...
