summary: This study presents a new method to improve medical visual question answering by breaking down answer generation into explicit reasoning steps that focus on relevant parts of medical images, making the process more transparent. They also introduce a reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to enhance the model's reasoning process, achieving similar results with less training data, which demonstrates the method's efficiency....
