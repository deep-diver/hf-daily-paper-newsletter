summary: This paper introduces a new type of policy called Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) for imitation learning. It is designed to be more efficient and scalable than current models, using fewer parameters and less computing power while still performing better on various tasks. The authors also provide a pre-trained version of MoDE for use in robotics tasks....
