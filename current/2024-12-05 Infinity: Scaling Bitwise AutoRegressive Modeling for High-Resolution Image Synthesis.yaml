summary: Infinity is a high-resolution, photorealistic image generation model that uses a bitwise token prediction framework with an infinite-vocabulary tokenizer & classifier and bitwise self-correction mechanism to improve generation capacity and details. It outperforms top-tier diffusion models and sets a new record for autoregressive text-to-image models, generating a high-quality 1024x1024 image in 0.8 seconds, making it 2.6x faster than SD3-Medium....
