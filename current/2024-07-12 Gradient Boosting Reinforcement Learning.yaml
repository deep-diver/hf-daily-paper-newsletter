summary: This paper introduces Gradient-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (GBRL), a framework that extends the advantages of Gradient Boosting Trees to the reinforcement learning domain. GBRL achieves competitive performance across a diverse array of tasks, particularly in domains with structured or categorical features. The paper also presents a high-performance, GPU-accelerated implementation of GBRL that integrates seamlessly with widely-used RL libraries....
