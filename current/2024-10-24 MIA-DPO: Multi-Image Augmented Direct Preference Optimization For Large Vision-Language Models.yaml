summary: The paper introduces MIA-DPO, a method for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to predict human preferences between visual inputs, especially for multi-image tasks. It addresses the scarcity of diverse multi-image training data by extending single-image data with unrelated images and using attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses. MIA-DPO outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks and has minimal impact on the model's ability to understand single ...
