summary: The study presents RealGen, a framework for generating photorealistic images from text, which addresses the issue of 'fake' images produced by existing models. RealGen uses an LLM component for prompt optimization and a diffusion model for image generation, and introduces a 'Detector Reward' mechanism to enhance image realism and detail. The framework significantly outperforms other models in realism, detail, and aesthetics....
