summary: The paper presents a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment long, unsegmented online demonstration videos into skill-consistent segments in open-world environments, using Skill Boundary Detection (SBD) to detect changes in skill execution through prediction errors from a pretrained model. The method was evaluated in Minecraft, showing significant performance improvements in both short-term atomic skill tasks and long-horizon tasks....
