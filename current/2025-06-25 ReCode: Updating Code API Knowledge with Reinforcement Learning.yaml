summary: The research presents a new framework, ReCode, to improve code generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) in response to frequent changes in external library APIs. ReCode achieves this by training LLMs to update their API knowledge using a dataset of 2,000 entries and a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation, which enhances LLMs' performance in dynamic API scenarios without negatively affecting their general code generation abilities....
