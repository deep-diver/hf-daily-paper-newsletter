summary: Difix3D+ is a new pipeline that enhances 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis using single-step diffusion models. It includes Difix, a model trained to reduce artifacts in rendered views during reconstruction and inference, improving 3D representation quality and removing residual artifacts, while being compatible with both NeRF and 3DGS representations....
