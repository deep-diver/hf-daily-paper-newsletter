summary: The authors present CORRECT, a lightweight error recognition framework for multi-agent systems that uses a cache of error patterns to identify and correct errors without requiring training. This approach significantly improves error localization and adapts to dynamic deployments quickly, and the authors also introduce a large-scale dataset of annotated trajectories to support research in this area....
