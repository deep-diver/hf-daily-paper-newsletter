summary: This study presents a new framework called Bidirectional Normalizing Flow (BiFlow) that enhances the generation quality and accelerates sampling in normalizing flows, a method for generative modeling, by learning an approximate inverse mapping instead of relying on an exact analytic inverse. Experiments show that BiFlow significantly outperforms its counterpart with causal decoding on ImageNet and achieves state-of-the-art results among normalizing flow-based methods....
