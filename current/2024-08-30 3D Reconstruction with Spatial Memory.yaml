summary: Spann3R is a new method for creating 3D images from collections of pictures. It uses a computer program called a transformer to guess where things are in 3D space without needing to know about the pictures or the camera. It keeps track of what it has learned about 3D space in a special memory, and uses this to guess the 3D position of things in new pictures. It can do this quickly and works well on many different pictures....
