summary: The authors present Long-RewardBench, a benchmark for evaluating reward models in long-context scenarios, and introduce a training strategy to create robust long-context reward models (LongRMs) that improve performance while maintaining short-context capability. Their 8B LongRM outperforms larger models and matches the performance of a proprietary model....
