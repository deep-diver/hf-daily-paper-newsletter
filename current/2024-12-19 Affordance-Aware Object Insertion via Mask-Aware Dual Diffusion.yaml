summary: This paper introduces a new way to insert objects into scenes by considering how well the object fits into the scene, called affordance-aware object insertion.

MADD is designed to consider both the colors of the scene and the shape of the object to make the insertion look natural. The model is able to place objects in new scenes and even do well on images from the internet....
