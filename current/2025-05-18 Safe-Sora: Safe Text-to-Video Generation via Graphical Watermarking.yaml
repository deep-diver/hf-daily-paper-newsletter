summary: The authors present Safe-Sora, a novel framework for embedding graphical watermarks in AI-generated videos, addressing the lack of invisible watermarking in video generation. They introduce a hierarchical mechanism for matching watermark patches to video frames and develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture for spatiotemporal fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance in video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness....
