summary: The paper presents a scalable algorithm that uses Reinforcement Learning to improve diffusion models, making them more aligned with human preferences, fairness, and compositionality over millions of images. This approach substantially outperforms existing methods and improves pretrained Stable Diffusion models, generating samples preferred by humans 80.3% of the time....
