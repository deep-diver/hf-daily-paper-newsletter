summary: This research examines how different data quality impacts the training of large language models (LLMs), specifically through layer-wise gradients. The study discovers that various data evaluation metrics correlate with spectral properties derived from gradient singular value decomposition (SVD), with higher-quality data generally linked to lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks. Additionally, the analysis reveals that reasoning data generates richer gradient structures than instruction d...
