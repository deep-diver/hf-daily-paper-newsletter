summary: This study presents a new method to speed up diffusion models used for image generation without sacrificing quality. By using two specialized adapters, Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA, the model can accelerate the denoising process, achieving up to 5 times faster inference while maintaining visual quality. The adapters are trained efficiently with only one sample on a single V100 GPU within an hour, yet they generalize well to unseen prompts....
