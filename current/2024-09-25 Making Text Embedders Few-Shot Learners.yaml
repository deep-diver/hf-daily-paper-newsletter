summary: The paper introduces a new model called bge-en-icl that uses few-shot examples to create high-quality text embeddings using large language models with decoder-only architectures. The model's performance is tested on the MTEB and AIR-Bench benchmarks, and it sets a new state-of-the-art performance. The model, code, and dataset are available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding....
