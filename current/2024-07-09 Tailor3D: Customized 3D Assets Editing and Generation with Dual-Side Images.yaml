summary: This paper introduces Tailor3D, a new method for creating customized 3D assets from editable dual-side images. It works by editing the front view, generating the back view, and then seamlessly stitching them together using a Dual-sided LRM. The method is designed to enhance editing capabilities and reduce memory burdens, and it is integrated into a unified 3D representation with the LoRA Triplane Transformer. Experimental results show that Tailor3D is effective for various 3D generation and edit...
