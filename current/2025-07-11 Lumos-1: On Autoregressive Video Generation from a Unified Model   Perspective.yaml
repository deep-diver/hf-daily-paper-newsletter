summary: The authors present Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that maintains the language model architecture with minimal changes. They address challenges in incorporating spatiotemporal correlations and frame-wise loss imbalance, proposing MM-RoPE and AR-DF techniques, respectively. Lumos-1 demonstrates competitive performance on various video generation benchmarks using memory-efficient training on 48 GPUs....
