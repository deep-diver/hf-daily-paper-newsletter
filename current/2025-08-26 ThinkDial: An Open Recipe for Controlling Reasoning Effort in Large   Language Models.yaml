summary: 'The study presents ThinkDial, an open-source framework that allows for controlling reasoning effort in large language models by enabling users to switch between three reasoning modes: High, Medium, and Low, which offer varying levels of computational efficiency and performance. The framework achieves this through a unique training process that integrates budget-mode control and adaptive reward shaping, resulting in significant response length reductions without compromising performance....'
