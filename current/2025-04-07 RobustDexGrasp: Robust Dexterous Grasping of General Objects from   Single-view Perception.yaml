summary: The proposed method is a reinforcement-learning-based framework for zero-shot dynamic dexterous grasping of various unseen objects from single-view perception, with adaptive motions to external disturbances. It uses a hand-centric object representation for shape feature extraction and a mixed curriculum learning strategy for hand adaptation to disturbances, achieving high success rates in both simulated and real object grasping....
