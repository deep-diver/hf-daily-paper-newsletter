summary: 'The authors present a new framework called Property-Generated Solver that uses Property-Based Testing to validate code generated by Large Language Models. This framework helps ensure the code is correct and generalizable by utilizing two LLM-based agents: a Generator for code creation and refinement, and a Tester for managing the testing process and providing feedback. Experimental results show significant improvements over traditional Test-Driven Development methods....'
