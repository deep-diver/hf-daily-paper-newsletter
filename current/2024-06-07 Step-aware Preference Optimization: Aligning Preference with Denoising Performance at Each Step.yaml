summary: The paper introduces a new approach called Step-aware Preference Optimization (SPO) to improve the alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by adjusting the denoising performance at each step, using a step-aware preference model and a step-wise resampler to ensure accurate step-aware supervision. SPO significantly outperforms the latest Diffusion-DPO in aligning generated images with complex, detailed prompts and enhancing aesthetics, while also achieving more than 20x ...
