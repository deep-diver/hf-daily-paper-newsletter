summary: This paper provides a fairer and more comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks, including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing, and symbolic formula representation. The main observation is that MLP generally outperforms KAN, except for symbolic formula representation tasks. The paper also conducts ablation studies on KAN and finds that its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from its B-spline activation ...
