summary: The study explains the shift from 'Act I' of generative AI, where models were knowledge-retrieval systems, to 'Act II', where they become thought-construction engines using test-time scaling techniques. The paper breaks down advanced cognition engineering approaches, making them accessible to every practitioner....
