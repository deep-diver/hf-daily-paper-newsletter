summary: The 3CAD dataset is proposed for industrial anomaly detection, featuring 27,039 high-resolution images of eight different manufactured parts, covering various anomaly sizes, types, and combinations. Additionally, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework, Coarse-to-Fine detection paradigm with Recovery Guidance (CFRG), is introduced, demonstrating strong competitiveness in detecting small defect anomalies....
