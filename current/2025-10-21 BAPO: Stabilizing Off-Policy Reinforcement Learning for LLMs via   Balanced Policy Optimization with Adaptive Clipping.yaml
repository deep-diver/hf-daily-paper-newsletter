summary: This study addresses the challenges of off-policy reinforcement learning for large language models, focusing on the issues of declining policy entropy and optimization instability. The authors propose BAPO, a new method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to balance positive and negative contributions, maintain entropy, and stabilize the learning process, resulting in fast, stable, and data-efficient training....
