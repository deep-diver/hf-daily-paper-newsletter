summary: LongGenBench is a new benchmark for evaluating long-context generation capabilities in language models. It offers flexible configurations of customized generation context lengths and requires models to respond with a single, cohesive long-context answer. Upon evaluation, it was found that both API accessed and open source models exhibit performance degradation in long-context generation scenarios, with varying trends across different series of LLMs. The Gemini-1.5-Flash model showed the least de...
