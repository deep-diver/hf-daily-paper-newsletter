title: 'Orient Anything: Learning Robust Object Orientation Estimation from Rendering 3D Models'
thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.18605
summary: This paper introduces a new model called Orient Anything that can accurately estimate the orientation of objects in a single image by learning from 3D models and synthetic-to-real transfer strategies. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and improves various applications such as spatial concept comprehension and 3D object pose adjustment. ...
