summary: The study presents TraDo, a series of advanced diffusion language models that use a new reinforcement learning framework called TraceRL. This framework improves reasoning ability in complex math and coding tasks, even outperforming larger models, and offers better sampling flexibility with its adaptability to larger blocks. Additionally, the research introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing, training, and deploying diffusion language models, which includes various fine-tun...
