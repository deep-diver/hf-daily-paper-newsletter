summary: This work presents Video SimpleQA, a new benchmark for evaluating factuality in Large Video Language Models (LVLMs). The benchmark has unique features such as requiring external knowledge, objective questions, short answers, external verification, and temporal reasoning. The study evaluated 41 LVLMs, finding that many struggle with factual adherence, especially open-source models, and that retrieval-augmented generation can improve performance but comes with additional inference time overhead....
