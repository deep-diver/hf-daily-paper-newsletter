summary: This paper describes BlockFusion, a model that generates and expands 3D scenes
  by using a combination of latent tri-plane extrapolation and a Multi-layer Perceptron.
  The model can handle large and complex scenes with diverse and high-quality shapes,
  and it can be easily extended by appending empty blocks and extrapolating latent
  tri-planes. The use of a 2D layout conditioning mechanism allows for control over
  the placement and arrangement of scene elements....
