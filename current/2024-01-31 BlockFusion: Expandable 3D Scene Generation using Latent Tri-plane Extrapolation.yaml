summary: This paper describes BlockFusion, a model that generates and expands 3D scenes by using a combination of latent tri-plane extrapolation and a Multi-layer Perceptron. The model can handle large and complex scenes with diverse and high-quality shapes, and it can be easily extended by appending empty blocks and extrapolating latent tri-planes. The use of a 2D layout conditioning mechanism allows for control over the placement and arrangement of scene elements....
