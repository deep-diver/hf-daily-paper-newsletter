summary: This research introduces a new data selection strategy called Variance-Aware Sampling to improve multimodal reasoning models, addressing the issue of unstable reinforcement learning algorithms. The study also provides a large, high-quality dataset for training these models and releases open-source versions of the models themselves, demonstrating their effectiveness through experiments and analysis....
