summary: This study presents SATORI, a method that improves multimodal reasoning in visual question answering by breaking it down into three verifiable stages, which enhances focus on important image regions and reduces computational costs. The researchers also created VQA-Verify, a dataset with over 12,000 annotated examples, and their experiments showed significant accuracy improvements compared to existing methods....
