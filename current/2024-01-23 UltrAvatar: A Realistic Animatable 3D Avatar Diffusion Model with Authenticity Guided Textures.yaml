summary: UltrAvatar is a novel 3D avatar generation approach that employs a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model to overcome the limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and single image-based 3D avatar generation methods. The former removes unwanted lighting effects to reveal true diffuse colors, while the latter generates PBR textures with two gradient-based guidances to render face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh geometry. The p...
