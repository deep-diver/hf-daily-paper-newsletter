summary: The authors present a unified framework called UniAVGen for generating audio and video content simultaneously. Its key features include a dual-branch architecture, asymmetric cross-modal interactions, and a face-aware modulation module, which together ensure precise synchronization and semantic consistency between audio and video. UniAVGen can perform various audio-video tasks using fewer training samples compared to existing methods....
