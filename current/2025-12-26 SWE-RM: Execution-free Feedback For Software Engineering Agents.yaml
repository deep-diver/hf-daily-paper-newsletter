summary: This study explores execution-free feedback for software engineering agents, focusing on developing robust reward models that perform well in both test-time scaling and reinforcement learning. The researchers identify key factors for RL training, such as classification accuracy and calibration, and introduce SWE-RM, a new reward model that significantly enhances agent performance in both areas....
