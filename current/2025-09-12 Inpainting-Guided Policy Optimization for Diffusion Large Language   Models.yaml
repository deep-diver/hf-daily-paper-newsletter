summary: This study presents a new reinforcement learning framework, IGPO, for diffusion large language models that uses inpainting to guide exploration and improve efficiency. The proposed method inserts partial ground-truth reasoning traces during online sampling, which helps the model discover correct solutions faster and reduces sample waste, leading to significant performance improvements across various mathematical benchmarks....
