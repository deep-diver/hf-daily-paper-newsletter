summary: The authors present a method called Test3R that improves 3D reconstruction accuracy by optimizing a network during testing using a self-supervised approach. This technique ensures consistent outputs across different input pairs and performs better than previous methods on 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation tasks, with minimal additional cost and effort....
