summary: The authors improve a self-supervised framework for art style classification by replacing its linear projection layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). This enhancement allows for better modeling of complex style features and global context, resulting in improved accuracy on art style classification datasets compared to the original framework....
