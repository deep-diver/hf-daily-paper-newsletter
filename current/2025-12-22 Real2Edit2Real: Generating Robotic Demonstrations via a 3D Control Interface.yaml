summary: The authors present a framework called Real2Edit2Real that generates new robotic demonstrations by combining 3D edits with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. This method improves data efficiency for training robotic policies by up to 10-50 times, demonstrating its potential as a unified data generation framework for robot learning....
