summary: In this work, we present a method called Mixture of Score Guidance (MSG) for transferring motion from one video to another without any additional training or fine-tuning. MSG is a framework that preserves scene composition and enables creative scene transformations while maintaining the integrity of transferred motion patterns. We also introduce MotionBench, a dataset of 200 source videos and 1000 transferred motions, which covers a variety of scenarios including single object, multiple objects,...
