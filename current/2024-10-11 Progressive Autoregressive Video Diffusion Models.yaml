summary: This paper presents a new method for generating long videos using existing video diffusion models. The key idea is to assign the latent frames with progressively increasing noise levels, which allows for fine-grained condition among the latents and large overlaps between the attention windows. This allows the models to autoregressively generate video frames without quality degradation or abrupt scene changes. The authors present state-of-the-art results on long video generation at 1 minute (1440...
