summary: FreeScale is a method that allows pre-trained visual diffusion models to generate high-quality images and videos at higher resolutions without the need for additional training or tuning. It does this by fusing information from different receptive scales and extracting desired frequency components, which helps to reduce repetitive patterns and improve the overall quality of the generated content. FreeScale has been shown to be effective for both image and video models, and it is the first method ...
