summary: The paper proposes AStar, a new approach that addresses the challenges of complex visual reasoning in multimodal large language models by using automated structured thinking via Monte Carlo Tree Search. AStar balances performance and efficiency by deriving high-level cognitive reasoning patterns from limited data and integrating models' internal reasoning capabilities with external reasoning guidelines, resulting in superior accuracy with a 7B backbone compared to GPT-4o while maintaining substa...
