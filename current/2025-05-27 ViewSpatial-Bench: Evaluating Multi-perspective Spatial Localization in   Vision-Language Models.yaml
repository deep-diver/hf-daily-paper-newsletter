summary: The researchers created a new benchmark called ViewSpatial-Bench to test vision-language models' ability to understand spatial relationships from different viewpoints. They found that these models perform better when looking at things from the camera's perspective but struggle when trying to understand things from a human's perspective. By training the models with their new benchmark, they improved the models' performance by 46.24%....
