summary: The study presents a new method called CoSpaDi for compressing large language models without reducing their accuracy. It replaces the traditional low-rank weight approximation with a more flexible structured sparse factorization, enabling better model fidelity and efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication. The method is evaluated across multiple models and demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods....
