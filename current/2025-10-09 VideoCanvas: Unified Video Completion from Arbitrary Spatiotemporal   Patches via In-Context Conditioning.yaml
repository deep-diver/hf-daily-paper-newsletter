summary: The study presents a new method called VideoCanvas that allows users to generate videos by specifying arbitrary patches in any spatial location and time, similar to painting on a video canvas. This approach unifies various controllable video generation tasks and addresses the challenge of precise frame-level conditioning in modern latent video diffusion models by proposing a hybrid conditioning strategy, resulting in significant performance improvement over existing methods....
