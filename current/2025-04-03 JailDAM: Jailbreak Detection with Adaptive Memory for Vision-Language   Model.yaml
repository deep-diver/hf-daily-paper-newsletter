summary: The proposed JAILDAM framework is a test-time adaptive method for detecting jailbreak attacks in vision-language models. It uses a memory-based approach with policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, which does not require explicit exposure to harmful data and improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency....
