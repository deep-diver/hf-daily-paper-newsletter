summary: This paper proposes LLM2LLM, an iterative data augmentation strategy that uses a teacher LLM to enhance a small seed dataset by generating synthetic data based on incorrect data points from a fine-tuned student LLM. This approach significantly improves the performance of LLMs in the low-data regime, outperforming traditional fine-tuning and other data augmentation baselines, and reduces dependence on labor-intensive data curation....
