summary: DreamPolish is a text-to-3D generation model that creates detailed 3D objects with photorealistic textures. It uses multiple neural representations to improve stability and incorporates an additional normal estimator to polish geometry details. The model also introduces a new score distillation objective to guide neural representations towards a domain with high-quality textures, and it outperforms existing methods....
