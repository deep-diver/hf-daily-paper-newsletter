summary: The proposed method, FreeGrasp, uses the world knowledge of pre-trained VLMs to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements for robotic grasping from a cluttered bin in a zero-shot setting. Since no existing dataset is available, a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData is introduced by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution....
