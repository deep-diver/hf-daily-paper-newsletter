summary: This paper proposes a method called Memory-Consolidated Vision Transformer (MC-ViT) that solves the problem of short context limits in existing video encoders. MC-ViT extends context by fine-tuning pre-trained video transformers to attend to non-parametric memories derived from past activations, resulting in improved understanding of long-context videos on multiple datasets while maintaining computational efficiency....
