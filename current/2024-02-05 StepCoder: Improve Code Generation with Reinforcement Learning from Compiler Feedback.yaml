summary: This paper proposes StepCoder, a reinforcement learning framework for code generation that addresses the challenges of long code generation and unexecuted code optimizations. It uses a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks and Fine-Grained Optimization to improve exploration and optimization, and is trained on the manually verified APPS+ dataset. The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding benchmarks....
