summary: This paper proposes StepCoder, a reinforcement learning framework for code
  generation that addresses the challenges of long code generation and unexecuted
  code optimizations. It uses a Curriculum of Code Completion Subtasks and Fine-Grained
  Optimization to improve exploration and optimization, and is trained on the manually
  verified APPS+ dataset. The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in corresponding
  benchmarks....
