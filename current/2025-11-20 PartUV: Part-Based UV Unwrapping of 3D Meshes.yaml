summary: PartUV is a UV unwrapping pipeline that creates fewer, aligned charts for AI-generated meshes, reducing artifacts and improving efficiency. It uses semantic part decomposition, geometric heuristics, and parallelization to outperform existing tools and neural methods in chart count, seam length, and distortion across various datasets....
