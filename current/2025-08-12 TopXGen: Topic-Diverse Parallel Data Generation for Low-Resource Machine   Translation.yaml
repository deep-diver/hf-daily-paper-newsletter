summary: The study presents TopXGen, a new method that uses artificial intelligence to create high-quality and diverse text data in less common languages, which can then be used to improve machine translation in those languages. The method takes advantage of AI's ability to translate well into more common languages to generate natural-sounding texts, which can then be translated back into a high-resource language for training purposes. The results show that TopXGen improves translation performance during...
