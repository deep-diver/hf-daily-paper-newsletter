summary: The authors present a new method called Share-GRPO to improve the reasoning skills of multimodal large language models using reinforcement learning. Share-GRPO addresses challenges like sparse rewards and advantage vanishing by exploring and sharing diverse reasoning paths, and it also shares reward information to better estimate solution advantages, resulting in improved model performance....
