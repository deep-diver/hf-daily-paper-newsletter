summary: The authors present a new method for generating large-scale 3D models of the Earth's surface, addressing the challenge of scaling by introducing a massive aerial dataset and a novel framework called EarthCrafter. This framework separates structural and textural generation, using sparse-decoupled latent diffusion to reduce computation costs while maintaining detail, and can be used for various applications like semantic-guided urban layout generation or unconditional terrain synthesis....
