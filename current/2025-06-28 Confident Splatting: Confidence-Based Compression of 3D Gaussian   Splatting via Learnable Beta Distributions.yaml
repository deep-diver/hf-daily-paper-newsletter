summary: This research presents a new method to reduce storage and computational requirements for 3D rendering using Gaussian Splatting. By assigning confidence scores to each splat, they can remove less important ones while maintaining image quality, and introduce a new metric to evaluate scene quality, all while keeping the method compatible with existing splatting techniques....
