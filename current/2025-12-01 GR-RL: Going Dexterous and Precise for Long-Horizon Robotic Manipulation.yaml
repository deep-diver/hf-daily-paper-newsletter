summary: The authors propose GR-RL, a robotic learning framework that enhances a generalist vision-language-action policy for long-horizon dexterous manipulation tasks. GR-RL uses a multi-stage training pipeline with demonstration filtering, augmentation, and reinforcement learning to improve performance and generalization, allowing a robot to autonomously lace up a shoe with high success rate....
