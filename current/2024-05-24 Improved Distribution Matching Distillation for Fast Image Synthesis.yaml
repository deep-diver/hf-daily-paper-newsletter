summary: We propose DMD2, a set of techniques that improve the Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) method for training one-step generators. Our improvements include eliminating the regression loss, integrating a GAN loss, and modifying the training procedure to enable multi-step sampling. These enhancements result in better image generation performance, with FID scores of 1.28 on ImageNet-64x64 and 8.35 on zero-shot COCO 2014, surpassing the original teacher model despite a 500X reduction in inferen...
