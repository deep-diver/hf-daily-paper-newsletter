summary: This paper proposes a new method, IM-3D, for generating high-quality 3D objects from text descriptions. Unlike existing approaches, IM-3D uses video generators instead of image generators, combined with a 3D reconstruction algorithm, resulting in more efficient and better quality 3D models with fewer geometric inconsistencies....
