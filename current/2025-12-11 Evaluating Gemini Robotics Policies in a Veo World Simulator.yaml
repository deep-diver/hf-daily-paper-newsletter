summary: This study presents a system that uses advanced video models to simulate and evaluate robotics policies in various scenarios, including those that are different from training conditions, to assess performance and safety. The system enables editing of scenes to include new objects and backgrounds, allowing for accurate prediction of policy performance in both normal and challenging situations, and helps identify unsafe behaviors....
