summary: The study presents pi-Flow, a new model that improves few-step diffusion by having a student model mimic a teacher model's behavior, resulting in faster and more accurate data generation while avoiding trade-offs between quality and diversity. Tests on ImageNet and other datasets show that pi-Flow outperforms other methods in terms of quality and diversity....
