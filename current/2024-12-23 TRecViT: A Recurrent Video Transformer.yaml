summary: We present a new video modelling block that uses recurrent units, self-attention, and MLPs for mixing information over time, space, and channels. Our model, TRecViT, performs well on various tasks and outperforms or matches a pure attention model on large video datasets while using less parameters, memory, and computational resources....
