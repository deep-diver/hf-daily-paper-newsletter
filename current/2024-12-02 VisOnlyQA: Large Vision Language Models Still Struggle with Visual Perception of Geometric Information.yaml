summary: A new dataset called VisOnlyQA has been introduced to evaluate the visual perception capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) on scientific figures. The dataset highlights that current LVLMs struggle with visual perception tasks, but fine-tuning on synthetic training data and using stronger language models can improve their performance....
