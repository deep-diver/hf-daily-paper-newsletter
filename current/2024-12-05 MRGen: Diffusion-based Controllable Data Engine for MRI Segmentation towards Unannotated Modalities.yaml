summary: 'Medical image segmentation has recently demonstrated impressive progress with deep neural networks, yet the heterogeneous modalities and scarcity of mask annotations limit the development of segmentation models on unannotated modalities. This paper investigates a new paradigm for leveraging generative models in medical applications: controllably synthesizing data for unannotated modalities, without requiring registered data pairs. Specifically, we make the following contributions in this paper: ...'
