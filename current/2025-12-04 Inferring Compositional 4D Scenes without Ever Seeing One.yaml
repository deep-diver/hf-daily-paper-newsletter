summary: This research presents a method called COM4D that can accurately predict the structure and movement of multiple objects in a scene using only 2D video input, without relying on any 3D or 4D training data. By learning from both object compositions and single object dynamics, COM4D can reconstruct complex, interactive scenes directly from video footage....
