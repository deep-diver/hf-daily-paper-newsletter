summary: The study explores how language models retrieve bound entities in-context and finds that while positional mechanism works for short lists, it fails for longer ones. The models then use lexical and reflexive mechanisms to compensate, which the study uses to create a causal model that estimates next token distributions accurately. This model also works for longer and more complex inputs, providing a better understanding of how language models handle entity retrieval....
