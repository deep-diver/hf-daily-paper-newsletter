summary: This paper proposes FlexiDreamer, a single image-to-3D generation framework that reconstructs the target mesh in an end-to-end manner using FlexiCubes, a flexible gradient-based extraction method, and a multi-resolution hash grid encoding scheme. FlexiDreamer can recover a dense 3D structure from a single-view image in approximately 1 minute, outperforming previous methodologies....
