summary: The authors present Nemotron-Cascade, a new method for creating general-purpose reasoning models using reinforcement learning. Instead of mixing different types of problems, Nemotron-Cascade handles them one domain at a time, making the training process more efficient and effective, allowing the model to outperform its teacher on various benchmarks....
