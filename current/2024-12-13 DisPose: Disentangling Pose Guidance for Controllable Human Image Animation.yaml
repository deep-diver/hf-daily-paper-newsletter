summary: 'DisPose is a method for creating more realistic and controllable human image animations by separating pose guidance into two parts: motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. It generates a dense motion field from a sparse motion field and a reference image, and extracts diffusion features corresponding to pose keypoints from the reference image. These features are then transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. DisPose improves the quality and consistency o...'
