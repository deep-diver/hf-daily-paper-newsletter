summary: The proposed DOEI approach enhances Class Activation Maps (CAMs) for weakly supervised semantic segmentation by reconstructing embedding representations through semantic-aware attention weight matrices, improving the expression capability of embedding information. DOEI also includes a hybrid-feature alignment module to increase the reliability of candidate tokens, resulting in a significant improvement in CAM quality and segmentation performance on popular benchmarks....
