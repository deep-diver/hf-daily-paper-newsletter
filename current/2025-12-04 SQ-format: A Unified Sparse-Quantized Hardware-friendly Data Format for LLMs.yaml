summary: The authors propose a new data format called SQ-format that balances accuracy and efficiency for large language models by combining quantization and sparsification techniques. SQ-format is compatible with both new hardware and existing GPUs, enabling high-precision acceleration for sparse matrices and low-precision matrix multiplication, resulting in improved performance and throughput....
