summary: Our approach learns variable-length token representations for 2D images by recursively processing 2D image tokens, updating existing 1D latent tokens, and adaptively increasing representational capacity by adding new tokens. This enables compression of images into a variable number of tokens, ranging from 32 to 256. We validate our tokenizer using reconstruction loss and FID metrics, demonstrating that token count aligns with image entropy, familiarity and downstream task requirements. Recurrent...
