summary: This paper explores using meta-learning to its limits by amortizing the most powerful universal predictor, Solomonoff Induction, into neural networks through exposure to a broad range of patterns generated by Universal Turing Machines (UTMs). Results suggest that UTM data is valuable for meta-learning, and can be used to train neural networks capable of learning universal prediction strategies....
