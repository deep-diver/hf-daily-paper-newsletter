summary: The LeetCodeDataset is a new, high-quality benchmark for code-generation models, focusing on reasoning-based coding challenges and providing a self-contained training environment. This dataset, which includes LeetCode Python problems with extensive metadata, numerous test cases, and data from before and after July 2024, allows for unbiased evaluation and efficient model training. Experiments have shown that reasoning-based models perform better than non-reasoning models, and training with fewer ...
