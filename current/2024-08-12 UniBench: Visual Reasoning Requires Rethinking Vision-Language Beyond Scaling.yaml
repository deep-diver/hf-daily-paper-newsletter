summary: UniBench is a tool that helps researchers evaluate the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) by providing a unified implementation of 50+ benchmarks. The tool shows that while scaling up VLM training data or model size can improve many capabilities, it doesn't help much with reasoning or relations. The tool also reveals that today's best VLMs struggle with simple tasks like digit recognition and counting, but more precise interventions like data quality or tailored learning objectives off...
