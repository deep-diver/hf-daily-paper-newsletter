summary: 'The paper proposes D^2iT, a dynamic diffusion transformer that addresses limitations of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture by dynamically compressing different image regions based on their importance. This is achieved via a two-stage framework: Dynamic VAE (DVAE) that tailors downsampling rates for different image regions, and Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D^2iT) that generates images by predicting multi-grained noise. The approach balances global consistency and local realism, and is...'
