summary: The proposed ACTalker framework supports both multiple and single-signal control for creating facial videos, using a parallel MAMBA structure with separate branches for each driving signal to control specific facial regions. It employs a gate mechanism for flexible control and a mask-drop strategy to ensure each driving signal independently controls its corresponding facial region, producing natural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals....
