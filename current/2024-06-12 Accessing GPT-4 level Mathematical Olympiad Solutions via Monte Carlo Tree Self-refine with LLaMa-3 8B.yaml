summary: MCT Self-Refine (MCTSr) is a new algorithm that improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex mathematical reasoning tasks by combining them with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It uses a systematic exploration and self-refine mechanism to optimize decision-making frameworks, and it has been shown to be effective in solving Olympiad-level mathematical problems....
