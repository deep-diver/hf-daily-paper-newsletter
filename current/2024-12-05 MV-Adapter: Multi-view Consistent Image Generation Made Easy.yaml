summary: This paper introduces MV-Adapter, a versatile plug-and-play adapter that enhances text-to-image models for multi-view image generation without altering the original network structure or feature space. It updates fewer parameters, enabling efficient training and preserving the prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained models, mitigating overfitting risks. MV-Adapter achieves multi-view generation at 768 resolution on Stable Diffusion XL and demonstrates adaptability and versatility, setting a new q...
