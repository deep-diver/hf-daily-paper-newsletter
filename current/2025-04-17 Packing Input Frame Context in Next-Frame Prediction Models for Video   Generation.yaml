summary: The presented FramePack neural network structure enhances video generation by compressing input frames for a fixed transformer context length, enabling high batch sizes similar to image diffusion training. It also introduces an anti-drifting sampling method in inverted temporal order to avoid exposure bias, and can improve the visual quality of existing video diffusion models through finetuning....
