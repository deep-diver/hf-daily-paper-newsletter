summary: The authors propose a new method called Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT) that enables multimodal language models to directly produce both textual and visual outputs, improving performance on tasks like detection and segmentation by using visual reference tokens and a lightweight decoder. PaDT achieves state-of-the-art results across various tasks, even compared to larger models, and the code is available for public use....
