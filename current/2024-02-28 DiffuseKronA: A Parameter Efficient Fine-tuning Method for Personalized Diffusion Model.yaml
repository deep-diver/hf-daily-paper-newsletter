summary: The paper introduces DiffuseKronA, a new method for fine-tuning diffusion models in text-to-image generation, which reduces the number of parameters by 35% and 99.947% compared to LoRA-DreamBooth and the original DreamBooth, respectively. It also improves image quality and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters, making it easier to use and more efficient....
