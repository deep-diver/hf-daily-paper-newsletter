summary: The proposed DuoDecoding method strategically deploys the draft and target models on the CPU and GPU respectively, enabling parallel decoding while preserving draft quality. It incorporates a hardware-aware optimal draft budget to minimize idle times and employs dynamic multi-sequence drafting to enhance draft quality, resulting in up to 2.61x speedup in generation latency and a reduction in TTFT to 83% of conventional speculative decoding....
