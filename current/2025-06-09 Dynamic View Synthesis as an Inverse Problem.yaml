summary: This research proposes a new method for creating dynamic images from single videos without training or additional modules. They overcome a key challenge by introducing a novel noise representation, enabling precise alignment between encoded and inverted latents. To fill in occluded regions, they use Stochastic Latent Modulation, which samples over the latent space based on visibility. Experiments show that this approach works well for dynamic view synthesis through structured latent manipulation...
