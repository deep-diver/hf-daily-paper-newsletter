summary: The paper investigates the efficiency and accuracy trade-offs of sparse attention in Transformer LLMs for long-context tasks. It presents key findings on the benefits of larger, highly sparse models for very long sequences, the correlation between sparsity and model size, and the need for careful evaluation of trade-offs for performance-sensitive applications....
