summary: Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD) is introduced to address the limitations of the Latent Consistency Model (LCM) in generating clear and detailed images. TCD utilizes a trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling to reduce distillation errors and circumvent accumulated errors, resulting in better image quality at low and high NFEs....
