summary: This paper introduces Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a new algorithm that helps AI agents, like those powered by GPT-4o, make better decisions in complex situations. R-MCTS improves the agent's performance by learning from past interactions and using multi-agent debate to evaluate its actions. The fine-tuned GPT-4o model, trained with R-MCTS, shows a 6% to 30% improvement on the VisualWebArena benchmark and reduces compute usage by a factor of four at test time. The model also demo...
