summary: The paper introduces a new task and benchmark called Commonsense-T2I to evaluate the ability of text-to-image generation models to produce images that fit real-life commonsense. The benchmark presents a challenge by providing pairwise text prompts and expected outputs, and it is carefully hand-curated by experts. The paper benchmarks various state-of-the-art models and finds that there is still a large gap between image synthesis and real-life photos, even for advanced models like DALL-E 3 and s...
