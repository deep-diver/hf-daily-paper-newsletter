summary: The authors propose a new framework called LightBagel that combines existing models for multimodal understanding and generation, reducing the need for extensive training and computational resources. This method, which uses a double fusion mechanism, achieves strong results across various benchmarks, including text-to-image generation and image editing, by efficiently integrating high-level semantic representations with low-level spatial signals....
