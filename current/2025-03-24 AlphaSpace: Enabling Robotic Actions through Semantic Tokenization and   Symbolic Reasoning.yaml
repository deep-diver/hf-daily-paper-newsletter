summary: The proposed AlphaSpace methodology uses semantic tokenization to encode height information and integrates symbolic synthetic reasoning data to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs for 3D Cartesian space navigation. Experiments show that AlphaSpace outperforms GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in manipulation subtasks, achieving a total accuracy of 66.67%....
