summary: We propose a method called VisionReward to better align image and video generation models with human preferences. This is achieved by decomposing human preferences into multiple dimensions and developing a multi-objective preference learning algorithm. VisionReward outperforms existing methods and is available at https://github.com/THUDM/VisionReward....
