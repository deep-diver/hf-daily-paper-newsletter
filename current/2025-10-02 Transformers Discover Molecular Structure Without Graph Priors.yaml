summary: This study explores whether Transformers can learn molecular energies and forces directly from Cartesian coordinates, without relying on predefined graphs or physical priors. The results show that Transformers can adaptively learn physically consistent patterns and improve with more training resources, challenging the need for hard-coded graph biases in molecular modeling....
