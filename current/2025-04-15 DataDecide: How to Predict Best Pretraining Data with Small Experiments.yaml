summary: The study presents DataDecide, a comprehensive open-source suite for comparing language models trained on different datasets and scales. Researchers find that using a single, small model size to compare performance can accurately predict the best large models (up to 1B parameters) in 80% of cases, while also identifying a method to predict performance on certain benchmarks with just 0.01% of the compute....
