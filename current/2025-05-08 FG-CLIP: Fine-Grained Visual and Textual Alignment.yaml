summary: The authors present FG-CLIP, a model that improves fine-grained understanding in multimodal tasks by using large multimodal models for long caption-image pairs, a high-quality dataset with detailed captions and bounding boxes, and hard fine-grained negative samples. Experiments show that FG-CLIP outperforms the original CLIP and other methods in various tasks, such as fine-grained understanding, open-vocabulary object detection, and image-text retrieval....
