summary: The authors propose a new training method that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning to improve mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models. By extending the Fine-Tuning phase and using Reinforcement Learning to optimize solution length, the model becomes both highly accurate and efficient, as demonstrated by top performance on challenging benchmarks....
