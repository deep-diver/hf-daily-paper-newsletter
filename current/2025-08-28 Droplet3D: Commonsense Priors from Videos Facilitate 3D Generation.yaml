summary: This study presents a new method for generating 3D content using videos, which contain spatial and semantic information that can help overcome the limitations of existing 3D data. The researchers introduced a large-scale video dataset and a generative model that can produce consistent and plausible 3D content, demonstrating the potential for extending this approach to larger scenes....
