summary: We present Mulberry, an MLLM that uses Collective Monte Carlo Tree Search (CoMCTS) to learn and solve questions by creating intermediate reasoning steps. CoMCTS introduces collective learning into tree search for effective and efficient reasoning path searching and learning. Mulberry-260k, a multimodal dataset with rich, explicit, and well-defined reasoning nodes, is used to train the model. Experiments show that Mulberry outperforms other models on various benchmarks, and the code will be avail...
