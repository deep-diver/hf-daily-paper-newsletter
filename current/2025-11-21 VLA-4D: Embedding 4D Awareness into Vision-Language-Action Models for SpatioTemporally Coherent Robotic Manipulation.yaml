summary: The authors present VLA-4D, a vision-language-action model that improves robotic manipulation by incorporating 4D awareness for both spatial and temporal coherence. They achieve this by embedding time into 3D positions for a unified visual representation and extending spatial action representations with temporal information, resulting in smoother and more coordinated robotic movements....
