summary: The study presents ORBIT, a new framework for training large language models in complex, open-ended tasks, specifically in medical consultations, without relying on external medical knowledge or manual rules. By using dynamic rubrics to guide reinforcement learning, the framework significantly improves the model's performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark, demonstrating the potential of rubric-based feedback in advancing language models for intricate tasks....
