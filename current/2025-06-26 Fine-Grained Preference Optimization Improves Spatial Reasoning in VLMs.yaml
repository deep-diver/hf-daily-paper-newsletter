summary: The researchers developed a new model called SpatialReasoner-R1 to enhance spatial reasoning in vision-language models. They used a method called M3CTS to create diverse reasoning paths and introduced fDPO, which improved fine-grained spatial understanding, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning tasks....
