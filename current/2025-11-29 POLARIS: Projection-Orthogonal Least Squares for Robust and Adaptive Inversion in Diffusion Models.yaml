summary: 'The study investigates the Inversion-Denoising Paradigm used in diffusion models for image editing and restoration, identifying an overlooked factor causing reconstruction degradation: the approximate noise error. The researchers propose POLARIS, a method that reformulates inversion to address this error by treating the guidance scale as a step-wise variable, significantly improving inversion latent quality with minimal performance overhead....'
