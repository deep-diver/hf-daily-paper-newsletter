summary: The authors propose a new framework called sG-MDPs for automated theorem proving, where agents create and work towards their own subgoals based on the current proof state. They apply a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to solve this framework and build a system called Bourbaki, which uses multiple large language models to generate subgoals and synthesize tactics. Bourbaki achieves state-of-the-art results on the PutnamBench benchmark....
