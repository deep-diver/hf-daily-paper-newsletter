summary: The authors present DuaShepherd, a new framework that combines two signals, correctness and potential, to improve mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models. They built a pipeline to create a large dataset with these signals and a unified architecture to train reward models, resulting in better performance on MATH500 and ProcessBench benchmarks compared to models using only one signal....
