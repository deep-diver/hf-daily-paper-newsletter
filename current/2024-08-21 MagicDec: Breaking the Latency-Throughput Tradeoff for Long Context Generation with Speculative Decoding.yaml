summary: MagicDec is a technique that improves the speed of generating long contexts in large language models while maintaining high throughput. It does this by using speculative decoding and an intelligent drafting strategy, which helps to address the key-value (KV) bottleneck that can slow down the process. The technique is designed to be effective for a wide range of batch sizes and sequence lengths, making it useful for applications like chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows....
