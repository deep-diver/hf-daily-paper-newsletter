summary: 'BeTAIL is a method that combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from human demonstrations with online Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) to improve the performance and stability of autonomous racing. It reduces the need for environment interactions and improves performance even when the BeT is pretrained on different tracks than downstream learning.
