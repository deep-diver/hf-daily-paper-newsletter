summary: 'BeTAIL is a method that combines a Behavior Transformer (BeT) policy from
  human demonstrations with online Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) to improve
  the performance and stability of autonomous racing. It reduces the need for environment
  interactions and improves performance even when the BeT is pretrained on different
  tracks than downstream learning. Videos and code available at: <https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/BeTAIL/home>....'
