summary: The paper presents StableDrag, a framework for stable and precise drag-based image editing. It improves upon existing techniques by introducing a discriminative point tracking method and a confidence-based latent enhancement strategy for motion supervision. This results in more stable and accurate image manipulation, as demonstrated through experiments on DragBench....
