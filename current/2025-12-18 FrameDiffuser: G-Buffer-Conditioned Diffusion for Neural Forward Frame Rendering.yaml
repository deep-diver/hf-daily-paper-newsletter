summary: The authors present FrameDiffuser, a neural rendering framework that creates realistic and consistent frames for interactive applications by using G-buffer data and its own previous output. This method is efficient and effective for consumer gaming setups, unlike other diffusion-based approaches, by specializing training to individual environments....
