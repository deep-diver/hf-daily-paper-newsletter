summary: This paper introduces a new way to improve image generation using diffusion models. They use a special network called DiMR that can work at different image sizes and a technique called TD-LN that helps the model understand the order of things. This makes the images look better and is faster to compute. They tested their method on a large dataset of images and it worked better than other methods, with a score of 1.70 on ImageNet 256 x 256 and 2.89 on ImageNet 512 x 512. ...
