summary: This paper proposes a new way to tokenize images called subobject-level tokenization.
  Instead of dividing images into fixed-size patches, this method uses semantically
  meaningful image segments obtained from segmentation models. The paper introduces
  a Sequence-to-sequence AutoEncoder (SeqAE) to compress these subobject segments
  into compact embedding vectors, which are then fed into a large language model for
  vision language learning. Empirical results show that this method significantly
  improve...
