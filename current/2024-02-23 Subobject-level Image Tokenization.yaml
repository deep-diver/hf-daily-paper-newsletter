summary: This paper proposes a new way to tokenize images called subobject-level tokenization. Instead of dividing images into fixed-size patches, this method uses semantically meaningful image segments obtained from segmentation models. The paper introduces a Sequence-to-sequence AutoEncoder (SeqAE) to compress these subobject segments into compact embedding vectors, which are then fed into a large language model for vision language learning. Empirical results show that this method significantly improve...
