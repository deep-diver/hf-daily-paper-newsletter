summary: This study improves the interpretability of Artificial Text Detection by using Sparse Autoencoders to extract features from Gemma-2-2b residual stream, and identifies both interpretable and efficient features, analyzing their semantics and relevance to gain insights into how texts from various models differ from human-written content, showing that modern LLMs have a distinct writing style, especially in information-dense domains....
