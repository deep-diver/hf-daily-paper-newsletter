summary: The paper proposes a new metric called Alignment Quality Index (AQI) to evaluate the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and safety constraints. AQI analyzes the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space and combines various clustering quality measures to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant....
