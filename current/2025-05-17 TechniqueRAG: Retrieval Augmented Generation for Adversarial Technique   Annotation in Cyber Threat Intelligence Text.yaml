summary: The study presents a new method called TechniqueRAG that improves the accuracy of identifying adversarial techniques in cyber threat intelligence texts. This method uses a combination of off-the-shelf retrievers, instruction-tuned LLMs, and minimal text-technique pairs, and it addresses data scarcity by fine-tuning only the generation component on limited in-domain examples, resulting in state-of-the-art performance without the need for resource-intensive retrieval training or extensive labeled ...
