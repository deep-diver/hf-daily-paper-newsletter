summary: This paper introduces methods to improve the robustness of 3D Gaussian Splatting for practical applications like reconstructions from handheld phone captures. They address motion blur, imperfect camera poses, and color inconsistencies by modeling motion blur as a Gaussian distribution, proposing defocus blur compensation, and addressing color inconsistencies due to ambient light or camera settings. The solutions maintain the benefits of 3DGS in terms of training efficiency and rendering speed, a...
