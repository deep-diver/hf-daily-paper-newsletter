summary: This paper presents Robot See Robot Do (RSRD), a method that allows robots to learn articulated object manipulation from a single monocular RGB human demonstration. RSRD uses 4D Differentiable Part Models (4D-DPM) to recover 3D part motion from the video and plans bimanual arm motions to replicate the object trajectories. The method achieves an average success rate of 87% in each phase and a total end-to-end success rate of 60% across 90 trials, without any task-specific training or annotation....
