summary: The authors present ARTDECO, a new framework that balances the speed of feed-forward models with the accuracy of SLAM-based pipelines for real-time 3D reconstruction from images. By utilizing 3D foundation models and a hierarchical Gaussian representation, ARTDECO achieves high-quality reconstructions with interactive performance, making it a promising solution for applications like AR/VR and robotics....
