summary: The paper presents a new method called VeriFree that enables reinforcement learning for general reasoning tasks without the need for a verifier model, which is a common requirement in current language model training. VeriFree directly maximizes the probability of generating the correct answer and has been shown to perform as well as or better than existing methods on various benchmarks, while also offering practical benefits such as reduced compute requirements and eliminating the need for a sep...
