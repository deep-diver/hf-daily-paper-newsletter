summary: LoCoBench is a new benchmark for evaluating long-context language models in complex software development scenarios, focusing on understanding entire codebases and reasoning across multiple files, which existing benchmarks do not cover. It includes 8,000 scenarios in 10 programming languages, with context lengths ranging from 10K to 1M tokens, and 8 task categories to assess long-context capabilities, revealing significant performance gaps in state-of-the-art models....
