summary: Trans-LoRA is a method that allows for the transfer of LoRA modules between different base models without the need for access to the original task data. This is achieved by using synthetic data generated by a data generator to approximate the data-generating process of the observed task data subset. The synthetic data is then used to train the LoRA modules, allowing for their transfer to new models. Trans-LoRA has been shown to be effective in transferring LoRA modules between models within and ...
