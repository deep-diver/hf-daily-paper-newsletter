summary: The paper proposes an efficient approach for text-to-video super-resolution using diffusion-based methods. They use an inflated architecture that incorporates a text-to-image SR model with a temporal adapter for coherence. The approach is tested on the Shutterstock video dataset, demonstrating good visual quality and temporal consistency. Visualizations of the results are available in a video format....
