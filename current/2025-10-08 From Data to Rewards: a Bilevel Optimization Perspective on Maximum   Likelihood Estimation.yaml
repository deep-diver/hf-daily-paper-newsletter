summary: The authors propose a new training method for generative models using a Bilevel Optimization framework, which addresses the issue of aligning models when only high-quality datasets are available, by treating the reward function as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem. They provide a theoretical analysis of this method and show its application to tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning....
