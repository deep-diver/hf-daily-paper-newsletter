summary: The study investigates three methods to improve image editing, focusing on a unified autoregressive model for text and visual data. The research finds that reinforcement learning combined with a large multimodal language model is the most effective, leading to the development of EARL, a strong RL-based image editing model that outperforms baselines with less training data....
