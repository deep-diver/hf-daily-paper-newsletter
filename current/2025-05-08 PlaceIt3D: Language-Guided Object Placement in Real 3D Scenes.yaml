summary: This study presents a new challenge called Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes, where a model places a 3D object in a real-life scene based on a text description, considering multiple valid solutions and 3D geometric relationships. The researchers introduce a new benchmark, evaluation protocol, and dataset for training 3D Language Models, providing a baseline for future comparisons in this task....
