summary: The study presents TimesNet-Gen, a new method for generating strong earthquake motions that takes into account local site conditions. This approach, which uses a station-specific latent bottleneck, effectively captures the characteristics of ground motion and outperforms a baseline model in generating site-specific strong motions....
