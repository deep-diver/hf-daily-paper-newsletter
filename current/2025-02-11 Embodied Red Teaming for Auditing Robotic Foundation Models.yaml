summary: The presented method, Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), is a new way to evaluate language-conditioned robot models. ERT generates diverse and challenging instructions using automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to test the models, which has shown to expose limitations in current benchmarks in assessing real-world performance and safety....
