summary: This paper introduces LEGENT, an open platform for developing human-like embodied agents using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). LEGENT offers a rich, interactive 3D environment with communicable and actionable agents, a user-friendly interface, and a sophisticated data generation pipeline utilizing advanced algorithms to exploit supervision from simulated worlds at scale. The platform's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments, where an embryonic vision-l...
