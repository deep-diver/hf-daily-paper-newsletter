summary: 'This paper proposes a unified framework called Graph Sequence Model (GSM) for adopting sequence models for graphs, which consists of three main steps: tokenization, local encoding, and global encoding. The paper also introduces GSM++, a hybrid model that uses Hierarchical Affinity Clustering (HAC) algorithm to tokenize the graph into hierarchical sequences and employs a hybrid architecture of Transformer to encode these sequences. The paper''s theoretical and experimental results show that GSM++ ...'
