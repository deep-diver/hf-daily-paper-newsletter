summary: This paper introduces a method to reveal the proportions of various domains or languages in the training data of language models by analyzing the byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers used by these models. The method involves solving a linear program that uses the merge list of a BPE tokenizer along with data samples for each category of interest to determine the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. The authors apply their method to off-the-shelf tokenizers and make new inf...
