summary: The study presents a new reinforcement learning algorithm, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), which is efficient and effective for training large language models. GSPO differs from previous algorithms by using sequence likelihood for importance ratios and performing sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization, resulting in better training efficiency, stabilized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and potential simplification of RL infrastructure design....
