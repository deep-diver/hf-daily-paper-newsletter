summary: This paper introduces two new methods to enhance the quality of conditional diffusion models, Independent Condition Guidance (ICG) and Time-Step Guidance (TSG), which provide the benefits of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) without the need for special training procedures. ICG can be used during inference on any pre-trained conditional model, while TSG can be applied to any diffusion model, including unconditional ones. The proposed methods are easy to implement and have the same sampling cost as ...
