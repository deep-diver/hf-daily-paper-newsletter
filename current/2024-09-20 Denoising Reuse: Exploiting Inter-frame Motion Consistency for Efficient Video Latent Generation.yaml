summary: The paper proposes a new method called Diffusion Reuse MOtion (Dr. Mo) to generate video frames using diffusion-based models. Dr. Mo reduces the computational cost of video generation by reusing noises from earlier denoising steps and incorporating lightweight inter-frame motions. A meta-network called Denoising Step Selector (DSS) is used to determine the optimal intermediate steps for each video frame, balancing efficiency and quality....
