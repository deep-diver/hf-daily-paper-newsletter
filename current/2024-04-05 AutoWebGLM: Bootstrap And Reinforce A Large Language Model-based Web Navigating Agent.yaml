summary: This paper presents AutoWebGLM, a web navigating agent that outperforms GPT-4 and is built upon ChatGLM3-6B. The agent uses an HTML simplification algorithm and a hybrid human-AI method to build web browsing data, and is further enhanced by reinforcement learning and rejection sampling. The paper also introduces AutoWebBench, a bilingual benchmark for real-world web browsing tasks, and highlights the improvements and challenges of the agent in tackling real environments....
