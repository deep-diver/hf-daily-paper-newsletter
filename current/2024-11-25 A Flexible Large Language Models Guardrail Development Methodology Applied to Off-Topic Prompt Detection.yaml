summary: This paper proposes a new methodology for creating guardrails to prevent large language models from being misused. The method involves defining the problem qualitatively and then using an LLM to generate prompts, which are then used to train guardrails. The method is flexible, data-free, and effective, and the synthetic dataset and guardrail models are open-sourced for future research and development....
