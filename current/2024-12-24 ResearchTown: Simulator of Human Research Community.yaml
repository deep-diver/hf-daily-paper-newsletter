summary: ResearchTown is a multi-agent framework for simulating human research communities using Large Language Models (LLMs). It models researchers and papers as nodes in an agent-data graph, and uses TextGNN for text-based inference. ResearchTown can realistically simulate collaborative research activities, maintain robust simulation with diverse papers, and generate interdisciplinary research ideas. The benchmark ResearchBench uses node-masking prediction task for scalable and objective assessment bas...
