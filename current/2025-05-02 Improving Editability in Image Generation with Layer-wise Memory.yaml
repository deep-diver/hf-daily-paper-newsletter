summary: This study presents a new framework for image editing that allows for multiple, sequential edits with minimal user input. The framework uses layer-wise memory to store and utilize previous edits, ensuring consistent and natural integration of new elements while maintaining the contextual relationships of existing objects. The researchers also introduce a new benchmark dataset and demonstrate the method's superior performance in iterative image editing tasks through comprehensive experiments....
