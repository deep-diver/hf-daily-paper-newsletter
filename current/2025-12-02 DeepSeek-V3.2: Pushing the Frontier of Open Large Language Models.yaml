summary: DeepSeek-V3.2 is a new and improved language model that uses an efficient attention mechanism called DSA to handle long contexts better while using less computational power. It also uses a scalable reinforcement learning framework to compete with top models like GPT-5 and Gemini-3.0-Pro, and has a unique data generation method for better tool-use and problem-solving skills in complex environments....
