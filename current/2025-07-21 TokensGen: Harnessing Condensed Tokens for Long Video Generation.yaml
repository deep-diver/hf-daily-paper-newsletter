summary: 'The authors present a new method called TokensGen, which uses condensed tokens to create long videos with better consistency and less memory use. This approach breaks down video creation into three tasks: controlling video meaning, ensuring consistency over time, and making smooth transitions between clips. The result is a more efficient and scalable way to generate long videos, which could be useful for storytelling, movies, and simulations....'
