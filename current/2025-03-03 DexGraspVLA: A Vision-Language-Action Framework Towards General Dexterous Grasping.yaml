summary: DexGraspVLA, a novel robotics framework for dexterous grasping, uses a pre-trained Vision-Language model for high-level task planning and a diffusion-based policy for low-level action control. This hierarchical approach iteratively transforms language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations, enabling effective imitation learning and robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios, with a 90+% success rate in 'zero-shot' environments....
