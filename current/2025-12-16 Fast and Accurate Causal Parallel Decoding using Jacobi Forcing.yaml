summary: This research presents Jacobi Forcing, a new method that trains AR models to become efficient parallel decoders without losing their original causal inference abilities, resulting in significant speedup for coding and math tasks with minimal performance loss. Additionally, the study introduces multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which further enhances speed and reduces inference latency....
