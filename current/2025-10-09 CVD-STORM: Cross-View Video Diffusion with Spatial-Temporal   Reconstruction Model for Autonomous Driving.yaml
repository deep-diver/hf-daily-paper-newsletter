summary: The authors present a new method called CVD-STORM that creates realistic, long-term, multi-view videos for self-driving cars. This technique uses a specialized Variational Autoencoder to capture 3D structures and temporal dynamics, which is then combined with a video diffusion process to produce high-quality videos with additional information like depth estimation....
