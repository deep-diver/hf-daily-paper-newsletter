summary: This paper explores the use of sparse autoencoders to analyze and interpret the internal workings of text-to-image models, specifically focusing on the SDXL Turbo model. By training sparse autoencoders on the updates performed by transformer blocks within the model, the authors find that the learned features are interpretable and can be used to understand the specialized roles of different blocks within the model. The authors also demonstrate that the learned features can be used to influence th...
