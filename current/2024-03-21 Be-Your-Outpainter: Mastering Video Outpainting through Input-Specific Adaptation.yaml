summary: 'This paper introduces a new method called MOTIA for video outpainting, which uses a diffusion-based pipeline to generate video content outside the viewport of the input video while maintaining consistency. The method involves two main phases: input-specific adaptation and pattern-aware outpainting, and uses strategies such as spatial-aware insertion and noise travel to improve the quality and flexibility of the generated video. MOTIA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in benchmark tes...'
