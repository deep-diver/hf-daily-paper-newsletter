summary: SyntheOcc is a diffusion model that produces photorealistic and geometric-controlled street view images by conditioning on occupancy labels in driving scenarios. It uses 3D semantic multi-plane images (MPIs) to encode 3D geometric information and generate images that align with given geometric labels. SyntheOcc can generate diverse, annotated, and controllable datasets for applications like training perception models and simulation. It proves effective in generating controllable occupancy datase...
