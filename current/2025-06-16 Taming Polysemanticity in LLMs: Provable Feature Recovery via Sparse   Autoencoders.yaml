summary: This study presents a new framework and algorithm for training Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to improve the interpretation of Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method, called 'bias adaptation', adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure proper activation sparsity, allowing for correct recovery of all monosemantic features. The researchers provide theoretical proof of this algorithm's effectiveness and demonstrate its superior performance compared to benchmark methods when applied to ...
