summary: The researchers present Archer, an approach for enhancing Large Language Models' reasoning abilities through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards, by distinguishing between low-entropy knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Archer applies different constraints to these token types, improving performance on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks compared to previous methods....
