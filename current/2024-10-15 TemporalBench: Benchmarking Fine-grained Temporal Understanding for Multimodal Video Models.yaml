summary: TemporalBench is a new benchmark that evaluates fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. It consists of 10K video question-answer pairs derived from 2K human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap between humans and AI in temporal understanding. TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning ca...
