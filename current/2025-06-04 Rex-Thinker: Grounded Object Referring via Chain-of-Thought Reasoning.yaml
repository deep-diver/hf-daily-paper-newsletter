summary: The study presents Rex-Thinker, a model that uses a chain-of-thought reasoning approach for object referring, which enhances explainability and accuracy. Rex-Thinker identifies potential object candidates and assesses them step-by-step to match a given expression, supported by a large-scale CoT-style referring dataset. The model outperforms standard baselines in precision and interpretability, and demonstrates improved ability to reject hallucinated outputs and strong generalization in out-of-do...
