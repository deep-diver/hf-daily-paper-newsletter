summary: The paper introduces In-Context Robot Transformer (ICRT), a causal transformer that performs autoregressive prediction on sensorimotor trajectories without relying on any linguistic data or reward function. This enables flexible and training-free execution of new tasks at test time by prompting the model with sensorimotor trajectories of the new task. The ICRT can adapt to new tasks specified by prompts, even in environment configurations that differ from both the prompt and the training data. I...
