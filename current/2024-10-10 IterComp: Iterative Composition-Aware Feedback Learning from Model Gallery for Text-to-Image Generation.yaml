summary: IterComp is a new framework that uses feedback from multiple models to improve the composition of text-to-image generation. It trains reward models using a gallery of six powerful open-source diffusion models and an iterative feedback learning method. This allows for the progressive self-refinement of both the base diffusion model and reward models over multiple iterations. The method outperforms previous SOTA methods, particularly in multi-category object composition and complex semantic alignm...
