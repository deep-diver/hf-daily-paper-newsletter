summary: The paper presents Control LLM, a method to enhance large language models' capabilities without retraining from scratch, addressing catastrophic forgetting during Continuous Pre-training and Continuous Supervised Fine-Tuning. Control LLM leverages parallel pre-trained and expanded transformer blocks, aligning their hidden-states using interpolation strategies, achieving significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, coding performance, and multilingual capabilities while preserving original...
