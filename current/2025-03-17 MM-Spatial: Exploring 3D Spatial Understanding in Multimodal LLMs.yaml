summary: The research introduces a new dataset and benchmark, CA-VQA, to enhance 3D spatial understanding in multimodal large language models. The dataset, which includes diverse spatial tasks and metric depth information, allows for the training of MM-Spatial, a strong generalist model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including the research's own....
