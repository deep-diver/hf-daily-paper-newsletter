summary: The paper introduces a new approach called MonST3R that estimates the geometry of dynamic scenes by creating a pointmap for each timestep, which adapt DUST3R's representation for static scenes. This approach requires limited training data and outperforms prior work in terms of robustness and efficiency for video depth and camera pose estimation....
