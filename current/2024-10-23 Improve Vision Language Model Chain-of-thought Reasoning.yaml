summary: This paper proposes a two-fold approach to improve chain-of-thought reasoning in vision language models. They distill rationales from a large language model to enrich the training data and fine-tune VLMs, and apply reinforcement learning to further calibrate reasoning quality. Experiments show significant improvements in CoT reasoning on benchmark datasets and better generalization to direct answer prediction....
