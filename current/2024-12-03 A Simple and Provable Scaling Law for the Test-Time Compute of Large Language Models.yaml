summary: This paper proposes a two-stage algorithm that uses a language model to generate and compare candidate solutions. The algorithm has a provable scaling law for test-time compute, meaning the failure probability decreases exponentially with the number of candidate solutions and comparison rounds. The algorithm was tested on the MMLU-Pro benchmark and showed promising results, validating the assumptions and the benefits of scaling up the test-time compute....
