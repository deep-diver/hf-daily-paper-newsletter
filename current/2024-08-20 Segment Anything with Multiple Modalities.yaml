summary: We introduce MM-SAM, an extension and expansion of SAM that supports cross-modal and multi-modal processing for robust and enhanced segmentation with different sensor suites. It features two key designs, unsupervised cross-modal transfer and weakly-supervised multi-modal fusion, enabling label-efficient and parameter-efficient adaptation toward various sensor modalities. MM-SAM consistently outperforms SAM by large margins, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various sensors an...
