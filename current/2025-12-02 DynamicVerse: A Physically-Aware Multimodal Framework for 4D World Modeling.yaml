summary: The authors present DynamicVerse, a new framework that uses large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to create a comprehensive, physical-scale 4D model of dynamic real-world videos. This model accurately captures metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions, and outperforms existing methods in video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation tasks....
