summary: This paper introduces a new way to create image-text datasets for multimodal language models by using a low-cost but effective caption engine called Perceptual Fusion. The engine integrates different perception experts and an efficient language model to provide more accurate and complete image descriptions. The resulting dataset, DenseFusion-1M, outperforms other datasets and improves the performance of language models on various vision-language tasks, especially with high-resolution images....
