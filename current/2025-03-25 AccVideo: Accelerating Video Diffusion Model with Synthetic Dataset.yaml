summary: The paper presents AccVideo, a method to accelerate video diffusion models using a synthetic dataset. AccVideo generates multiple valid denoising trajectories to eliminate useless data points and utilizes key data points from the trajectories for fewer steps to learning the noise-to-video mapping, resulting in faster generation speed and higher quality videos....
