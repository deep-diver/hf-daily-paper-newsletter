summary: This study explores Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation to improve generation quality by using more inference-time computation, reinterpreting TTS as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. The research introduces an efficient TTS method called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) for video generation, which adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner, leading to significant improvements in video quality....
