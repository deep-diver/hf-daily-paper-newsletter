summary: AI currently struggles to accurately perceive transparent objects because of how light interacts with them, but advanced video-generating AI models already synthesize convincing transparent scenes, implying they've learned these complex optical rules. By repurposing one of these video diffusion models and training it on a new dataset of transparent objects, a system called DKT was developed that precisely estimates depth and normals, greatly improving robot interaction with such challenging mate...
