summary: Computers usually struggle to accurately 'see' transparent objects like glass due to how light behaves, but it turns out advanced video-generating AI models already seem to understand these tricky optical rules. By teaching one of these video AI models with special training videos, a new system was created that can accurately determine the depth and shape of transparent objects, helping robots grab them better than ever before....
