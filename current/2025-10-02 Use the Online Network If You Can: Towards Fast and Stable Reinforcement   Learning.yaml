summary: This research proposes a new update rule, MINTO, that combines the stability of target networks and the speed of online networks in reinforcement learning. By using the minimum estimate between the target and online networks, MINTO ensures faster, stable learning and can be easily integrated into various RL algorithms, consistently improving performance across different benchmarks....
