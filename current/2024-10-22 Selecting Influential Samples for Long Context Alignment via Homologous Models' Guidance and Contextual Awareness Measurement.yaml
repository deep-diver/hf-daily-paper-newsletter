summary: We present GATEAU, a framework that uses two methods to select important samples for training long context alignment models. These methods are Homologous Models' Guidance (HMG) and Contextual Awareness Measurement (CAM). HMG measures how hard it is to generate responses with long contexts, while CAM measures how hard it is to understand long contexts. By using these methods, we can improve the performance of long context alignment models....
