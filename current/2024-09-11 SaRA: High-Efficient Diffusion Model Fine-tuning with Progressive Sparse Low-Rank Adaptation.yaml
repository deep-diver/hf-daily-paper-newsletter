summary: We propose a method called SaRA to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models by reusing temporarily ineffective parameters and using a low-rank sparse training scheme to prevent overfitting. This method improves the generative capabilities of pre-trained models and outperforms traditional fine-tuning methods like LoRA in maintaining model's generalization ability. Our approach is easy to implement and works well with existing methods....
