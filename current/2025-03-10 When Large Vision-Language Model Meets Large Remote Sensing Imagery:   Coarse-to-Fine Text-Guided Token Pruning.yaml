summary: The authors present a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration that aims to preserve image details while reducing computational complexity for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) processing large Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). They also introduce a new benchmark called LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels, and their method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies and demonstrates higher effic...
