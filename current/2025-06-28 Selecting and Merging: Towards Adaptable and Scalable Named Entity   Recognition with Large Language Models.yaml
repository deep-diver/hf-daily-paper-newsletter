summary: The SaM framework is proposed to improve named entity recognition by dynamically selecting and merging expert models for a target domain, based on domain similarity and performance. This approach enhances generalization across various domains without additional training and offers great scalability, outperforming unified models by an average of 10% in extensive experiments....
