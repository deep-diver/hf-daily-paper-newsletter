summary: The authors present a new method called CRISP that accurately reconstructs human motion and scene geometry from a single video by fitting simple shapes to the scene and using human posture to fill in missing details. This approach significantly reduces failures in motion tracking and speeds up simulation, demonstrating its usefulness for robotics and AR/VR applications....
