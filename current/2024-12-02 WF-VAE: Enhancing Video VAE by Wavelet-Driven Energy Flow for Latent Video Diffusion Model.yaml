summary: This paper introduces WF-VAE, a new video VAE that uses wavelet transform to encode videos more efficiently and maintain the integrity of the latent space. It demonstrates better performance in metrics such as PSNR and LPIPS, and is 2x faster and uses 4x less memory compared to existing video VAEs....
