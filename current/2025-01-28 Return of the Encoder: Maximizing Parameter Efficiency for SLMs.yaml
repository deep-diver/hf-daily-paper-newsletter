summary: This study finds that encoder-decoder architectures significantly outperform decoder-only models in small language models (SLMs) for edge devices, offering 47% lower first-token latency and 4.7x higher throughput. It also presents a new knowledge distillation framework that allows encoder-decoder models to leverage large decoder-only teachers, improving performance across tasks while maintaining architectural advantages....
