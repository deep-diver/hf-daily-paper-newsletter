summary: This study evaluates the vision understanding capabilities of popular multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, on standard computer vision tasks. The results show that while these models are not at the state-of-the-art level, they are respectable generalists, excelling in semantic tasks over geometric ones, with GPT-4o being the top performer among non-reasoning models....
