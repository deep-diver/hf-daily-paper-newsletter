summary: This study explores how language models learn from human preferences using a concept called Differential Information Distribution (DID). They discover that the way preferences are encoded affects the learning process, with low-entropy information reinforcing the policy distribution and high-entropy information smoothing it out. The research also highlights the importance of learning high-entropy differential information for general instruction-following and low-entropy information for knowledge-...
