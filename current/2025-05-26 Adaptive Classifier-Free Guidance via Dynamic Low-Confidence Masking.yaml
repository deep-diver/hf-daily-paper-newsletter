summary: This study presents a new method, Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance, which improves the controllability in generative models by adjusting the unconditional input based on the model's confidence. This method focuses on areas of uncertainty in the generated sequence, leading to more effective guidance and better performance compared to standard methods in various language generation benchmarks....
