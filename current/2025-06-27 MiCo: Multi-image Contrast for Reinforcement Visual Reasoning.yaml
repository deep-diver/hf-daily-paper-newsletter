summary: The authors propose a new method for training vision-language models to reason across multiple images without using manually curated data. By creating image triplets and prompting the model to compare them, the model learns to attend to subtle visual changes and perform logical reasoning, which improves its performance on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and general vision tasks....
