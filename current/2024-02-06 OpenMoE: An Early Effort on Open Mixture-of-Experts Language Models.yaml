summary: This study presents OpenMoE, a series of fully open-sourced and reproducible language models that use a Mixture-of-Experts approach. The researchers analyze the routing mechanisms within OpenMoE models and find that routing decisions are primarily based on token IDs and that assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase. They also propose strategies for improving MoE language model designs....
