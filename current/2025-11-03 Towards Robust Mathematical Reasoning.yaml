summary: The authors created IMO-Bench, a suite of advanced reasoning benchmarks inspired by the International Mathematical Olympiad, to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of foundation models. IMO-Bench consists of IMO-AnswerBench for short answer problems and IMO-Proof Bench for proof-writing capabilities, and the authors' model achieved impressive results on these benchmarks, outperforming other models and demonstrating strong correlation with human evaluations....
