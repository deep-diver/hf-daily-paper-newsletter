summary: The paper presents QKAN-LSTM, an improved LSTM model that incorporates quantum-inspired activation functions to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce trainable parameters. This new architecture, which can be run on classical hardware, is tested on three datasets and shown to outperform traditional LSTMs, and is further extended to create a Hybrid QKAN-LSTM for hierarchical representation learning....
