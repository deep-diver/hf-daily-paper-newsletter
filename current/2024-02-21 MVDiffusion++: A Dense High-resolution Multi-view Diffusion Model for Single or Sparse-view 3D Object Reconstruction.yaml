summary: This paper introduces MVDiffusion++, a neural architecture for 3D object
  reconstruction that can generate detailed images of an object from one or a few
  images without requiring camera poses. It uses a pose-free architecture and view
  dropout strategy to achieve efficient and accurate results, and outperforms current
  state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets....
