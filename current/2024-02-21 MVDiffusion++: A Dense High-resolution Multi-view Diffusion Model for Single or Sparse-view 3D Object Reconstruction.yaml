summary: This paper introduces MVDiffusion++, a neural architecture for 3D object reconstruction that can generate detailed images of an object from one or a few images without requiring camera poses. It uses a pose-free architecture and view dropout strategy to achieve efficient and accurate results, and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets....
