summary: The study provides evidence that model-free reinforcement learning agents can learn to plan using a methodology based on concept-based interpretability. The agent, DRC, uses learned concept representations to formulate plans and influence action selection, and the planning algorithm learned by the agent resembles parallelized bidirectional search...
