summary: A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model, storing information about the objects and the semantic relationships between them, making its use promising for robotic tasks. When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent method...
