summary: The authors present a new method called Elevate3D that upgrades low-quality 3D models into high-quality ones. It uses a special technique to enhance textures while keeping the model's appearance and fixing its geometry. This method is better than previous ones because it also improves the model's shape, making it more detailed and accurate, which is useful for computer graphics and 3D vision....
