summary: The study presents OmniRetarget, a data generation engine that creates realistic humanoid robot motions by preserving interactions with the environment and objects. This engine improves upon existing methods by minimizing physical artifacts and enabling efficient data augmentation, resulting in high-quality data for training proprioceptive RL policies to execute complex skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot....
