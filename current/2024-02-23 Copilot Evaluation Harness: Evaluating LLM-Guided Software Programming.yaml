summary: The authors present a new tool, called the Copilot evaluation harness, to evaluate different Large Language Models (LLMs) for their effectiveness as programming assistants in development environments. The tool has various metrics to measure success, such as generating code, documentation, test cases, fixing bugs, and understanding the workspace. It provides a more robust and detailed evaluation of LLMs in IDEs compared to existing systems....
