summary: This paper presents OK-Robot, a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework
  that combines Vision-Language Models, navigation primitives, and grasping primitives
  to offer an integrated solution for pick-and-drop operations without training. The
  framework achieves a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation
  with a 58.5% success rate in real-world environments. The paper also highlights
  the critical role of nuanced details when combining Open Knowledge systems and robotic
  modules....
