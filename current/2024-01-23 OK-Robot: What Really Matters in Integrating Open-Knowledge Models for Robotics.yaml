summary: This paper presents OK-Robot, a new Open Knowledge-based robotics framework that combines Vision-Language Models, navigation primitives, and grasping primitives to offer an integrated solution for pick-and-drop operations without training. The framework achieves a new state-of-the-art in Open Vocabulary Mobile Manipulation with a 58.5% success rate in real-world environments. The paper also highlights the critical role of nuanced details when combining Open Knowledge systems and robotic modules....
