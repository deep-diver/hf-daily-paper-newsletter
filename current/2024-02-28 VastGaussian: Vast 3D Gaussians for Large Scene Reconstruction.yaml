summary: This paper presents VastGaussian, a method for high-quality reconstruction and real-time rendering of large scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting. It addresses limitations of existing methods by dividing large scenes into multiple cells and using a progressive partitioning strategy for parallel optimization. It also introduces decoupled appearance modeling to reduce appearance variations in the rendered images, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets with fast optimization and high-...
