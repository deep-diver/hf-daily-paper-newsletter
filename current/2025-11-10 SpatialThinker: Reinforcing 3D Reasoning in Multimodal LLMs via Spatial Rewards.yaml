summary: The study presents SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware multimodal language model that improves spatial understanding through reinforcement learning and dense spatial rewards. It constructs a scene graph of relevant objects and spatial relations, outperforming other methods on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, even surpassing GPT-4o....
