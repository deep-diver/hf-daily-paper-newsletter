summary: CityDreamer4D is a model that generates complex 4D cities by separating moving objects (like cars) from buildings and roads, and using different types of neural fields for each. It also uses a new way to represent cities and a large dataset of real-world city images. This model can be used for many things, like changing the style of a city or simulating traffic, and it's better at generating realistic cities than other models....
