summary: The authors created a large, annotated dataset of scatterplots to test AI models' performance on tasks related to data visualization. They found that OpenAI models and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash were good at counting clusters and, in some cases, outliers, but struggled with precise location identification, and wide aspect ratio or randomly colored scatterplots negatively affected performance....
