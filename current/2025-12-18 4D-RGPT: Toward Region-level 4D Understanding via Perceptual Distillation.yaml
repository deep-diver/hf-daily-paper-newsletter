summary: The authors present a new model, 4D-RGPT, and a training method, Perceptual 4D Distillation, to improve multimodal language models' understanding of 3D structures and temporal dynamics in videos. They also introduce R4D-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting, which they created using a combination of automated and human-verified processes. The proposed model and benchmark show significant improvements in performance compared to existing metho...
