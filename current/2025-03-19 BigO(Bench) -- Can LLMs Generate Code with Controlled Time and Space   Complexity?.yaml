summary: The coding benchmark BigO(Bench) is presented to assess language models' ability in creating code considering time and space complexities. This benchmark contains a set of problems and solutions from Code Contests, with inferred complexity labels and runtime/memory data, and it demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art language models in handling complexity requirements....
