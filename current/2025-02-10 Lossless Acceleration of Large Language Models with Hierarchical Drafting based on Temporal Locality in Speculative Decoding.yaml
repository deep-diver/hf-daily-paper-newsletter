summary: The authors propose a new method called Hierarchy Drafting (HD) to improve the inference speed of Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing accuracy. HD organizes various token sources into multiple databases based on temporal locality and sequentially accesses them during the drafting step to generate tokens, ensuring consistent acceleration across diverse tasks and minimizing drafting latency....
