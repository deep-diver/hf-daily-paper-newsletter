summary: This paper presents PokéLLMon, an artificial intelligence agent in Pokémon battles that uses large language models to achieve human-parity performance. Its design includes strategies such as in-context reinforcement learning, knowledge-augmented generation, and consistent action generation, and it achieves a 49% win rate in the Ladder competitions and 56% in invited battles against human opponents. The implementation and battle logs can be found on GitHub....
