summary: "This paper presents Pok\xE9LLMon, an artificial intelligence agent in Pok\xE9\
  mon battles that uses large language models to achieve human-parity performance.\
  \ Its design includes strategies such as in-context reinforcement learning, knowledge-augmented\
  \ generation, and consistent action generation, and it achieves a 49% win rate in\
  \ the Ladder competitions and 56% in invited battles against human opponents. The\
  \ implementation and battle logs can be found on GitHub...."
