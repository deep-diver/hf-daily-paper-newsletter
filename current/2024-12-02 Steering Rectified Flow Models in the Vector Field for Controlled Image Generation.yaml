link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.00100
summary: This paper introduces FlowChef, a new method for controlled image generation that uses the vector field of rectified flow models (RFMs) to guide the denoising trajectory. FlowChef is a unified framework that can handle classifier guidance, linear inverse problems, and image editing without the need for extra training, inversion, or intensive backpropagation. It outperforms existing methods in terms of performance, memory, and time requirements, achieving new state-of-the-art results....
