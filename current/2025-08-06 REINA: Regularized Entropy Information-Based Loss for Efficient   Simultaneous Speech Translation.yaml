summary: The authors propose a new method, REINA, to improve simultaneous speech translation systems by balancing translation quality and latency. They demonstrate that REINA, based on information theory principles, outperforms previous approaches and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple languages using only open-source or synthetic data....
