summary: Implicit Neural Representation (INR), leveraging a neural network to transform coordinate input into corresponding attributes, has recently driven significant advances in several vision-related domains. However, the performance of INR is heavily influenced by the choice of the nonlinear activation function used in its multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Multiple nonlinearities have been investigated; yet, current INRs face limitations in capturing high-frequency components, diverse signal ...
