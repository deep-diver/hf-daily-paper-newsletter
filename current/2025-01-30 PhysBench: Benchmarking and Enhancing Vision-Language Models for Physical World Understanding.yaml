summary: PhysBench is a benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models' (VLMs) physical world understanding in 4 domains, revealing VLMs struggle with physical phenomena due to lack of physical knowledge in training data and no embedded physical priors. PhysAgent, a new framework combining VLMs' generalization with vision models' expertise, significantly enhances VLMs' physical understanding, improving GPT-4o by 18.4% and aiding embodied agents like MOKA....
