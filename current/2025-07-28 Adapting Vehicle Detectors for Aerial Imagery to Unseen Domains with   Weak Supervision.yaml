summary: This study presents a novel method using generative AI to create high-quality aerial images and labels, which helps train vehicle detectors more effectively by reducing the performance gap between different geographic regions. The proposed multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge transfer framework improves detection accuracy by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and over 50% compared to other methods, and introduces new annotated aerial datasets from New Zealand and Utah....
