summary: The study presents Ankh3, a protein language model that uses a multi-task pre-training strategy, improving its understanding of protein properties by learning from both masked language modeling and sequence completion. This approach led to better performance in various downstream tasks, such as secondary structure prediction and contact prediction, compared to models focused on a single pre-training task....
