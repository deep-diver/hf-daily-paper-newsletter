summary: The study presents a unified framework for understanding in-context learning strategies, using a hierarchical Bayesian approach that explains a model's behavior as an optimal adaptation to data given computational constraints. This framework can predict Transformer next-token predictions throughout training, showing a tradeoff between strategy loss and complexity, and offering explanations for well-known in-context learning phenomena and novel predictions....
