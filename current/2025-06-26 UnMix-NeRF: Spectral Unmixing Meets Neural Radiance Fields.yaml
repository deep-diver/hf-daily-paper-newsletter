summary: The study presents a new framework called UnMix-NeRF that combines spectral unmixing with Neural Radiance Fields. This integration allows for joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation by modeling spectral reflectance and using learned material signatures for clustering, resulting in improved performance over existing methods....
