summary: This paper presents an efficient algorithm, called Constrained Diffusion Implicit Models (CDIM), for solving noisy linear inverse problems using pretrained diffusion models. CDIM modifies the diffusion updates to enforce a constraint upon the final output. The algorithm shows strong performance across various tasks and metrics, providing a significant speed-up compared to previous conditional diffusion methods....
