summary: This paper introduces OCTAV, a novel dataset for capturing event transitions across audio and video, and OMCAT, a model that uses RoTE to enhance temporal grounding and computational efficiency in time-anchored tasks. OMCAT excels in cross-modal temporal understanding and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on AVQA tasks and the OCTAV benchmark....
