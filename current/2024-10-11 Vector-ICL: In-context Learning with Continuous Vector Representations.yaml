summary: This paper explores the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to process and learn from continuous vector representations obtained from black-box pretrained encoders. The authors introduce a method called Vector-ICL, which aligns input data with an LLM's embedding space through lightweight projectors. They find that pretraining projectors with general language modeling objectives enables Vector-ICL, while task-specific finetuning further enhances performance. Vector-ICL often outperf...
