summary: Our paper presents RayGauss, a novel method for volumetric Gaussian-based ray casting in novel view synthesis. It uses sparse Gaussian kernels to decompose the emitted radiance and density, enabling physically consistent rendering with superior quality compared to state-of-the-art methods. RayGauss also maintains reasonable training times and achieves inference speeds of 25 FPS on the Blender dataset, avoiding the artifacts common in splatting techniques.
