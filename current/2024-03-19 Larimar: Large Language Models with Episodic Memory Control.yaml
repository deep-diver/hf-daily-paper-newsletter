summary: This paper introduces Larimar, a brain-inspired architecture for enhancing Large Language Models with a distributed episodic memory that allows for dynamic, one-shot updates of knowledge without the need for computationally expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Larimar is fast, flexible, and can achieve accuracy comparable to most competitive baselines while also providing mechanisms for selective fact forgetting and input context length generalization....
