summary: This research presents a new method for reconstructing and analyzing dynamic scenes from single videos using a low-dimensional structure of 3D motion and data-driven priors. The method achieves better results for long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes compared to existing approaches....
