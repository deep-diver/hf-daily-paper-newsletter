summary: The authors propose TLB-VFI, an efficient video-based diffusion model for video frame interpolation that extracts rich temporal information, leading to improved performance and faster inference compared to image-based and video-based diffusion models. It achieves this through a 3D-wavelet gating and temporal-aware autoencoder, requiring significantly less training data and having fewer parameters than video-based diffusion models....
