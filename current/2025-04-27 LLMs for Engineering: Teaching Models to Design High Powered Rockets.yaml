summary: The study investigates the use of large language models in rocket design, specifically targeting altitude optimization and precision landing. The results indicate that while these models have good basic engineering knowledge, they don't improve much when given simulation results and fall short of human performance. However, when combined with reinforcement learning, a model with 7 billion parameters outperforms both human experts and other advanced models, suggesting that this approach could rev...
