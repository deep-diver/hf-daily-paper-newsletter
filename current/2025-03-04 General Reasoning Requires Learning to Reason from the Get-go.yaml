summary: 'The paper suggests that the main issue with large language models'' limited ability to generalize reasoning across new contexts is the intertwining of knowledge and reasoning. It proposes three key solutions: (1) pretraining to reason using RL from scratch, (2) using a curriculum of synthetic tasks to learn a reasoning prior for RL, and (3) learning more generalizable reasoning functions using a small context window. These solutions aim to decouple knowledge and reasoning, improving the models'' a...'
