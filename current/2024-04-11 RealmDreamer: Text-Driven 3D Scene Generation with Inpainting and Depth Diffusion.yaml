summary: This technique, RealmDreamer, generates 3D scenes from text descriptions using a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation. It optimizes the representation using image-conditional and depth diffusion models, and finetunes it using samples from image generators. It can synthesize high-quality scenes with multiple objects, without requiring video or multi-view data, and can work with different styles....
