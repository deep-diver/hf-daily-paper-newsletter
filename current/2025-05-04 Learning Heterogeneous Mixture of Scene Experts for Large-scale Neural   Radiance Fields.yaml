summary: The authors present Switch-NeRF++, a unified framework that efficiently learns heterogeneous decomposition and NeRFs for large-scale scenes. This system uses a gating network to decompose scenes and assign 3D points to specialized NeRF experts, resulting in significant efficiency improvements and state-of-the-art scene rendering accuracy....
