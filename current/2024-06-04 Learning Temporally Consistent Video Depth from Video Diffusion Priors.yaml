summary: This paper proposes a new method for video depth estimation that leverages prior knowledge from existing video generation models. The method involves training a model to predict depth from input videos using a mixture of image depth and video depth datasets. The study found that a procedural training strategy, which optimizes the spatial layers of the model first and then the temporal layers, yields the best results in terms of both spatial accuracy and temporal consistency....
