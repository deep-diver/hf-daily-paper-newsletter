summary: Real3D is a new system that trains Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) using real-world images. It introduces a self-training framework with unsupervised losses to supervise LRMs at the pixel and semantic levels, and an automatic data curation approach to collect high-quality examples from in-the-wild images. Real3D consistently outperforms prior work in various evaluation settings and is available at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/Real3D/....
