summary: A new method called MCC-Hand-Object (MCC-HO) is proposed to reconstruct the 3D geometry of hand-held objects using a single RGB image and inferred 3D hand. The method uses GPT-4(V) to retrieve a 3D object model that matches the object in the image and aligns it to the network-inferred geometry. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on lab and Internet datasets....
