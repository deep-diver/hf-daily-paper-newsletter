summary: 'This paper introduces OHRBench, a benchmark for evaluating the impact of OCR on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It identifies two types of OCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise, and demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems to these noises. The paper also discusses the potential of using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without OCR in RAG systems....'
