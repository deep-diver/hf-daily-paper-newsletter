summary: This paper introduces a large-scale dataset of Gaussian Splats called ShapeSplat and a method called Gaussian-MAE for self-supervised pretraining and supervised finetuning of 3D representation learning. The dataset consists of 65K objects from 87 unique categories and was created using the ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets. The paper provides valuable insights into the benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters and the importance of Gaussian feature grouping and splats pooling lay...
