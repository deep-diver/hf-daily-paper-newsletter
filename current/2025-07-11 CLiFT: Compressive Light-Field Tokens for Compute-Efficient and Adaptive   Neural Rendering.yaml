summary: The authors present a method for rendering scenes using 'compressed light-field tokens' which allows for efficient and adaptable rendering by reducing the amount of data needed while maintaining high quality. This approach enables the generation of new views with a single trained network, providing a balance between data size, rendering quality, and speed....
