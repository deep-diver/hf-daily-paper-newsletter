summary: The authors present a new framework called VeOmni that makes it easier and more efficient to train models that understand and generate information across different formats, such as text, images, and audio. VeOmni achieves this by separating the communication and computation processes and providing a flexible interface for integrating new types of data, resulting in faster training times and the ability to handle larger models and longer contexts....
