summary: This paper introduces a new dataset called MMGiC for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The dataset includes both coarse-grained and fine-grained concept annotations, which are designed to improve MLLM performance on vision-language tasks. The authors find that the multi-grained concept annotations in MMGiC complement each other and help MLLMs better align vision and language at multiple granularities. The dataset is evaluated on 12 multimodal comprehension and generation benchmarks, and ...
