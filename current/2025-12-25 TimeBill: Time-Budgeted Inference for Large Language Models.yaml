summary: The authors present a new framework called TimeBill that helps large language models generate accurate responses within a specific time limit. TimeBill uses prediction techniques to estimate execution time and adaptively adjusts cache eviction ratios, improving task completion rates and response performance in time-critical systems like robotics and autonomous driving....
