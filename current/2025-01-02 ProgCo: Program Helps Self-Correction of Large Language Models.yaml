summary: ProgCo is a method that uses self-generated, self-executing programs to help large language models verify and refine their own responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks. It improves the model's ability to self-correct and perform better when combined with real program tools, as shown in experiments on instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks....
