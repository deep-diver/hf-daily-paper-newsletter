summary: A new method called AuroBind has been developed to improve virtual screening for drug discovery. It can predict how drugs will bind to proteins with high accuracy and speed, allowing for the screening of large compound libraries quickly. The method has shown promising results in identifying potential drugs for previously undruggable targets....
