summary: This study presents Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO), a more stable alternative to a recent method called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that enhances the reasoning abilities of large language models. GMPO improves stability by optimizing the geometric mean of token-level rewards instead of the arithmetic mean, and it outperforms GRPO on various benchmarks, including mathematical and multimodal reasoning tasks....
