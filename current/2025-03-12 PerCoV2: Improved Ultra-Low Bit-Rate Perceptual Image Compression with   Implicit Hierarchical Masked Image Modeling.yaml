summary: This study presents PerCoV2, an open ultra-low bit-rate perceptual image compression system for applications with limited bandwidth and storage. PerCoV2 extends the original formulation to the Stable Diffusion 3 ecosystem, enhances entropy coding efficiency, and achieves higher image fidelity at lower bit-rates with competitive perceptual quality, compared to previous work....
