summary: The paper proposes a system called PAE that allows foundation model agents to discover and practice skills in the real world. It uses a task proposer to suggest tasks, a thought-based agent policy to attempt those tasks, and an autonomous success evaluator to assess the results. PAE is validated on vision-based web navigation tasks and outperforms other methods with real-world human-annotated benchmarks. The open-source code and checkpoints are available at https://yanqval.github.io/PAE/....
