summary: The authors present a new method called VIST3A that combines a text-to-video model and a 3D reconstruction system to create a powerful text-to-3D generator. They address challenges in integrating the two components and aligning them to produce high-quality, consistent 3D scenes, resulting in improved performance compared to previous text-to-3D models....
