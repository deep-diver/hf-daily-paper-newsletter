summary: The study presents a new method called ReplaceMe, which simplifies neural networks by removing layers and replacing them with a simple linear operation, without needing further training. This method is more efficient than existing techniques, as it only requires a small dataset to adjust the network, and it maintains high performance even after removing up to 25% of the layers in large language models....
