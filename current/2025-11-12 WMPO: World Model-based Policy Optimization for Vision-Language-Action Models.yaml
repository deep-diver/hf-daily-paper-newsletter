summary: The authors propose a new framework called WMPO that enables vision-language-action models to learn more efficiently and effectively by predicting pixel-based environments without interacting with the real world. WMPO improves sample efficiency, overall performance, and allows for self-correction, generalization, and lifelong learning in both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks....
