summary: This paper presents DragAnything, a motion control method for controllable video generation that uses an entity representation to control the motion of any object, including the background. It offers advantages over existing methods such as being user-friendly, capable of representing diverse entities, and allowing simultaneous motion control for multiple objects. Experiments show that DragAnything achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of object motion control....
