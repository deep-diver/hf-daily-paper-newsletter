summary: This paper presents DragAnything, a motion control method for controllable
  video generation that uses an entity representation to control the motion of any
  object, including the background. It offers advantages over existing methods such
  as being user-friendly, capable of representing diverse entities, and allowing simultaneous
  motion control for multiple objects. Experiments show that DragAnything achieves
  state-of-the-art performance in terms of object motion control....
