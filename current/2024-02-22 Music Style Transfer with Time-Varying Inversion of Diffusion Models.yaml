summary: This paper proposes a method for music style transfer using diffusion models and a time-varying textual inversion module, which can accurately capture musical attributes and transfer styles of specific instruments, even with limited data. The method also includes a bias-reduced stylization technique for stable results. Results and source code are available at the provided link....
