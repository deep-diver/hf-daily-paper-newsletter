summary: The study presents SwiReasoning, a new method for language models to improve reasoning accuracy and efficiency. It alternates between explicit and latent reasoning based on confidence, and limits thinking-block switches to prevent overthinking and enhance token usage, resulting in better performance on mathematics and STEM benchmarks....
