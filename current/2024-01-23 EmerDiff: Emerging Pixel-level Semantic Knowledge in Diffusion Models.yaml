summary: The paper proposes EmerDiff, a framework to extract fine-grained semantic knowledge from pre-trained diffusion models without additional training. The framework utilizes the semantic correspondences between image pixels and spatial locations of low-dimensional feature maps to construct image-resolution segmentation maps. In experiments, the generated segmentation maps demonstrate well-delineated and detailed parts, indicating the existence of accurate pixel-level semantic knowledge in diffusion ...
