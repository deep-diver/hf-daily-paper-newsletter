summary: This paper presents a method for scaling face interaction graph networks
  to real world scenes, improving accuracy and reducing memory requirements. The authors
  introduce a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs which can convert
  real-world scenes into a structured representation that can be processed by graph
  network simulator. They demonstrate that their method uses less memory than previous
  graph-based simulators while retaining accuracy, and that simulators learned in
  synthetic en...
