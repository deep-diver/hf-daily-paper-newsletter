summary: This paper presents a method for scaling face interaction graph networks to real world scenes, improving accuracy and reducing memory requirements. The authors introduce a perceptual interface in the form of editable NeRFs which can convert real-world scenes into a structured representation that can be processed by graph network simulator. They demonstrate that their method uses less memory than previous graph-based simulators while retaining accuracy, and that simulators learned in synthetic en...
