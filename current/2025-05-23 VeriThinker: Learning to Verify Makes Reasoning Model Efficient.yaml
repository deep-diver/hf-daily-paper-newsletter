summary: The study presents a new method called VeriThinker to make large reasoning models more efficient by reducing unnecessary reasoning chain lengths. This is achieved by training the models to verify the correctness of reasoning solutions, which helps them avoid overthinking and lowers inference costs. The approach has been validated through experiments and significantly improves accuracy and efficiency on various tasks....
