summary: The paper presents ShortV, a method to reduce computational costs in Multimodal Large Language Models by freezing visual token updates in layers that have minimal contribution, as identified using a novel metric called Layer Contribution (LC). Experiments show that ShortV can freeze visual tokens in approximately 60% of the MLLM layers, leading to a significant reduction in computational costs, such as a 50% reduction in FLOPs on LLaVA-NeXT-13B....
