summary: The study presents a new framework called PhysChoreo that creates realistic videos with controlled physical properties by estimating initial physical properties of objects in an image and using a physically editable simulation to generate dynamic behaviors. Experiments show that PhysChoreo outperforms existing methods in generating physically realistic videos with diverse controllability....
