summary: The study presents a new method called Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT) that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching, which is up to 25 times more efficient than the current method, FlowGRPO, and is CFG-free. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, enabling training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminating the need for likelihood estimation, and requiring only clean im...
