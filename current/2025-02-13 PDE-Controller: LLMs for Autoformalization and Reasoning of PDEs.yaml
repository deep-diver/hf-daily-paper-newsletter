summary: The presented PDE-Controller is a framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to control systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). This holistic solution involves datasets, math-reasoning models, and novel evaluation metrics, and outperforms prompting the latest open-source and GPT models in reasoning, autoformalization, and program synthesis....
