summary: The authors present Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to manage complex memory systems by learning from interaction and feedback. The framework is trained using a specialized dataset with diverse multi-turn interaction patterns and evaluated based on question-answering accuracy, resulting in significant improvements over existing memory-augmented agent baselines and robust generalization to long sequences....
