summary: LoRA Land is a technical report that introduces the use of Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reduced trainable parameters and memory usage. The report assesses the viability of LoRA fine-tuned models in real-world applications, measures their performance, and investigates the most effective base models for fine-tuning. LoRAX, an open-source inference server, is used to deploy multiple LoRA fine-tuned models on a single GPU, showcasing the quality and co...
