summary: The authors present UniLumos, a fast and unified framework for relighting images and videos, which ensures realistic lighting effects by incorporating RGB-space geometry feedback and supervising the model with depth and normal maps. UniLumos also introduces a structured annotation protocol and a benchmark for evaluating lighting controllability, resulting in improved physical consistency and a 20x speedup for relighting tasks....
