summary: Auto Cherry-Picker (ACP) is a new framework that uses a combination of large language models and text-to-image models to generate high-quality multi-modal training examples. These examples are then refined using a new metric called Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS) to ensure quality. ACP has been shown to improve the performance of existing models in various scenarios, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. The correlation betw...
