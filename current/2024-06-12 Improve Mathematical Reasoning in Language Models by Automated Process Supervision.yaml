summary: This abstract discusses the limitations of large language models in solving complex reasoning tasks and introduces a novel algorithm called OmegaPRM for efficiently collecting high-quality process supervision data. The algorithm addresses the limitation of insufficient reward or penalty for intermediate outcomes in reasoning tasks and is capable of collecting over 1.5 million process supervision annotations to train a Process Reward Model (PRM). The use of this fully automated process supervisio...
