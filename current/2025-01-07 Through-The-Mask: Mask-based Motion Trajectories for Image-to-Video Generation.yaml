summary: The paper introduces a two-stage framework for generating realistic videos from static images. It represents motion and semantics using mask-based motion trajectories, and uses object-level attention objectives to incorporate this representation. The method outperforms existing methods in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness, and is evaluated on a new challenging benchmark....
