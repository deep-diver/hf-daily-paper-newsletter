summary: The authors present BlenderGym, a benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in 3D graphics editing. This benchmark assesses VLM systems using code-based 3D reconstruction tasks and reveals that even the latest VLM systems struggle with tasks that are relatively simple for human Blender users. The study also shows that inference scaling techniques can enhance VLM performance on graphics editing tasks....
