summary: This paper presents DreamPolisher, a method that uses Gaussian Splatting to improve the quality of text-to-3D generation by enforcing geometric consistency and refining texture detail. The method uses a two-stage approach, with initial coarse 3D generation followed by refinement via geometric optimization and a ControlNet refiner. Empirical evaluations show that DreamPolisher generates realistic and consistent 3D objects aligned with the semantics of the textual instructions....
