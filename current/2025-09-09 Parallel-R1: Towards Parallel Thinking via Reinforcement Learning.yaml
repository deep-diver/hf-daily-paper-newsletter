summary: The authors present a reinforcement learning framework, Parallel-R1, which enables parallel thinking for large language models in complex reasoning tasks. This framework uses a progressive curriculum that starts with supervised fine-tuning on easier tasks to develop parallel thinking ability, then switches to reinforcement learning for exploring and generalizing this skill on more difficult problems. Experiments show that this approach leads to improved performance and a shift in the model's thi...
