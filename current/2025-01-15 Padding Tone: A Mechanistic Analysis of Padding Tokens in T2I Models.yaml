summary: This paper investigates the impact of padding tokens on Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The authors develop two causal techniques to analyze how information is encoded in the representation of tokens across different components of the T2I pipeline. They identify three distinct scenarios where padding tokens can affect the model's output during text encoding, during the diffusion process, or be ignored. The authors also identify key relationships between these scenarios and the model's arch...
