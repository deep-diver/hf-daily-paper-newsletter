summary: The authors propose a new framework, Decoupled Global-Local Alignment (DeGLA), to improve CLIP's understanding of compositional concepts like relationships and attributes without sacrificing its general capabilities. DeGLA uses a self-distillation mechanism to retain the model's inherent abilities and introduces new losses to enhance vision-language composition, resulting in better performance on various benchmarks and zero-shot classification tasks....
