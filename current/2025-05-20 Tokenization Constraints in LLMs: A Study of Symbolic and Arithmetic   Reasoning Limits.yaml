summary: This study explores how tokenization methods in language models, specifically subword-based techniques like BPE, hinder symbolic reasoning by disrupting logical alignment and atomic reasoning units. The researchers introduce the concept of Token Awareness and demonstrate that atomically-aligned formats significantly improve reasoning performance, enabling smaller models to outperform larger ones in structured tasks....
