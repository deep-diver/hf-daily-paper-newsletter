summary: This study presents a new method called Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2) to speed up the text-to-image generation process. SJD2 enables parallel token generation in autoregressive models by incorporating a denoising process, reducing the number of model forward passes while maintaining image quality....
