summary: The study presents UniREditBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating reasoning-based image editing models. This benchmark includes 2,700 samples covering real and game-world scenarios and introduces a multimodal dual-reference evaluation method to improve assessment reliability. The researchers also developed a large-scale synthetic dataset, UniREdit-Data-100K, to fine-tune the Bagel model, resulting in a new model called UniREdit-Bagel that shows significant improvements in performance....
