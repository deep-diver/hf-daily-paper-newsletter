summary: The study investigates GUI grounding and finds a 23.3% flaw rate in instructions, demonstrating that exploiting instruction diversity can significantly improve performance. The researchers propose a new Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm and a two-stage training framework, resulting in state-of-the-art models, UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B, that achieve high accuracy on various benchmarks and show strong agentic potential....
