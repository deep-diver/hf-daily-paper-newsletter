summary: We propose a new method called LayerPano3D for creating detailed, full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scenes from a single text prompt. Our method decomposes a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels and uses a diffusion prior to reveal unseen spaces from reference views. LayerPano3D has multiple dedicated designs, including a text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline and a layered 3D panorama representation to manage complex scene hierarchies. Our experiments show t...
