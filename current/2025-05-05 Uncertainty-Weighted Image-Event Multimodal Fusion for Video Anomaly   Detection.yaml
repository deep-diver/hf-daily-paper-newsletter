summary: The authors present a new method called IEF-VAD that combines image and event representations from RGB videos to improve video anomaly detection. This approach models sensor noise, balances modalities over time, and refines the fused state to reduce noise, setting a new state of the art without requiring dedicated event sensors or frame-level labels....
