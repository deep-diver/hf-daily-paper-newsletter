summary: This study addresses a problem called label length bias in large language models, where multi-token class labels cause inconsistent treatment of labels of different lengths. The researchers propose a solution called normalized contextual calibration, which normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level, resulting in significant improvement over prior approaches and reducing sensitivity to few-shot example selection....
