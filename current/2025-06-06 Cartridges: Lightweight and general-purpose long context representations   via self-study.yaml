summary: This research proposes a method to create smaller, more efficient KV caches, called Cartridges, for handling large text corpora in language models. By using a training technique called self-study, Cartridges can replicate the performance of in-context learning while requiring significantly less memory and enabling higher throughput, making them more cost-effective for serving long contexts....
