summary: This paper introduces MJ-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal judges in providing feedback for image generation models across different perspectives. Experiments show that close-source VLMs generally provide better feedback, while smaller-sized scoring models can provide better feedback regarding text-image alignment and image quality. Further studies reveal that VLM judges can generally provide more accurate and stable feedback in natural language scales. Human evaluations on end-to-end fi...
