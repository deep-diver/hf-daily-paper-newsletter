summary: This study explores how classifier-free guidance (CFG) affects image generation in different frequency domains, identifying that low frequencies impact global structure and alignment, while high frequencies enhance visual detail. The researchers then introduce frequency-decoupled guidance (FDG), a new method that separates CFG into low and high frequencies, applying distinct guidance strengths to each, resulting in improved image quality and diversity compared to standard CFG....
