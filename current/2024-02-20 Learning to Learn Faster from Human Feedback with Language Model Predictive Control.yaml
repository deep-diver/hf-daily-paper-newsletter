summary: This paper proposes a framework called Language Model Predictive Control
  (LMPC) to improve the teachability of large language models (LLMs) in robot code-writing.
  LMPC fine-tunes the LLM to remember its in-context interactions and combines it
  with classic robotics techniques to discover shorter paths to success. This results
  in a 26.9% improvement in non-expert teaching success rates and a reduction in the
  average number of human corrections from 2.4 to 1.9....
