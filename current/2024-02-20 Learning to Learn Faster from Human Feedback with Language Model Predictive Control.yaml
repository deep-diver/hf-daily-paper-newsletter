summary: This paper proposes a framework called Language Model Predictive Control (LMPC) to improve the teachability of large language models (LLMs) in robot code-writing. LMPC fine-tunes the LLM to remember its in-context interactions and combines it with classic robotics techniques to discover shorter paths to success. This results in a 26.9% improvement in non-expert teaching success rates and a reduction in the average number of human corrections from 2.4 to 1.9....
