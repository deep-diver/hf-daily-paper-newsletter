summary: The proposed Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model addresses limitations in diffusion and flow matching models by predicting dynamic Gaussian mixture parameters to capture a multi-modal flow velocity distribution, leading to better few-step sampling and improved image generation quality with a novel probabilistic guidance scheme....
