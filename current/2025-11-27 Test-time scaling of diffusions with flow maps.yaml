summary: The study presents a new method called Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT) that improves the performance of diffusion models during testing. FMTT works directly with a flow map to create better sample results compared to other methods, and it can be used for exact sampling or searching for the best sample based on a user-specified reward. This approach enables more complex image editing techniques, such as interfacing with vision language models....
