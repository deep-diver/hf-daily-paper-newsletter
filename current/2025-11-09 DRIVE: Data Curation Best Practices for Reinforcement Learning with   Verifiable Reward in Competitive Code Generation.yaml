summary: This study focuses on improving reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards for competitive programming code generation. The authors propose a two-stage training process that starts with fine-tuning a strong open-source model and then uses reinforcement learning with executable rewards. Their method, implemented on a large-scale model, achieves state-of-the-art performance and is comparable to leading systems, while also providing best practices for data curation and curriculum design....
