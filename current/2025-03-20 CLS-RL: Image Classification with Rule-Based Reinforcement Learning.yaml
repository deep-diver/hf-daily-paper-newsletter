summary: The paper presents CLS-RL, a rule-based reinforcement learning method for image classification using MLLMs. CLS-RL outperforms SFT in most datasets and has better performance in both base-to-new and few-shot learning settings, with a free-lunch phenomenon observed. It also introduces the No-Thinking-CLS-RL method, which minimizes thinking processes during training and achieves superior performance and generalization capabilities....
