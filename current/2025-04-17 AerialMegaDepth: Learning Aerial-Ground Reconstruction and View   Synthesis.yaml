summary: The paper presents a novel approach to create high-quality, co-registered aerial-ground datasets for training using a combination of pseudo-synthetic renderings from 3D city-wide meshes and real, crowd-sourced images. This hybrid dataset is used to fine-tune state-of-the-art algorithms, significantly improving their performance on real-world, zero-shot aerial-ground tasks, and demonstrating practical value in real-world applications....
