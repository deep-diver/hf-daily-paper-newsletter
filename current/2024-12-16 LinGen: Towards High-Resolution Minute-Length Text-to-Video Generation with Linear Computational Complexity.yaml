summary: A new method called LinGen is introduced that can generate high-resolution minute-length videos on a single GPU, which is a significant improvement over existing methods that can only generate videos of 10-20 seconds length due to their high computational cost. LinGen replaces a computationally-intensive block with a linear-complexity block called MATE, which consists of an MA-branch and a TE-branch. The MA-branch targets short-to-long-range correlations, while the TE-branch focuses on temporal ...
