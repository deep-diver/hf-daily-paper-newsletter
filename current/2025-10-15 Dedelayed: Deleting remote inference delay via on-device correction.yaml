summary: This study presents a method called Dedelayed that reduces the delay in remote inference, enabling real-time, low-latency predictions on local devices. By using a lightweight local model and fusing features from past frames computed by a remote model, Dedelayed improves semantic segmentation accuracy compared to local-only or remote-only baselines, especially under longer delays and higher-motion scenes....
