summary: The study presents 'Pixio', an improved autoencoder model that learns from pixels to create strong representations for various visual tasks. Trained on 2B web images, Pixio competes with or outperforms other large-scale models in tasks like depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, and semantic segmentation, showing that pixel-based self-supervised learning can be a promising alternative to other methods....
