summary: The authors present UI-Simulator, a cost-effective method to generate large-scale training data for digital agents by simulating diverse user interfaces, and UI-Simulator-Grow, which improves efficiency by focusing on high-impact tasks. Experiments show that agents trained with UI-Simulator perform as well as or better than those trained with real UI data, and UI-Simulator-Grow can match the performance of larger models using a smaller base model....
