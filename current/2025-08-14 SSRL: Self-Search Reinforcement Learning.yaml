summary: This study explores using large language models (LLMs) as efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning, reducing the need for costly external search engine interactions. The researchers developed Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' search capability through rewards, enabling models to refine their knowledge internally and providing a cost-effective environment for search-driven RL training, with findings showing reduced hallucination and seamless integration wi...
