summary: 'This paper proposes DiTFastAttn, a method to make image and video generation faster by reducing unnecessary computations in a type of model called Diffusion Transformers. It does this by finding and eliminating three types of redundancy in the attention computation: spatial, temporal, and conditional. The method is tested and shown to be effective on image and video generation tasks, reducing up to 88% of the computations and making generation up to 1.6 times faster at high resolutions....'
