summary: We propose a method called Compressed Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) to generate continuous and variable-length contemplation tokens for language models during inference. These tokens represent explicit reasoning chains and can be applied to existing models. Our method improves accuracy by allowing the models to reason over dense contentful representations, and the level of reasoning can be adjusted by controlling the number of tokens generated....
