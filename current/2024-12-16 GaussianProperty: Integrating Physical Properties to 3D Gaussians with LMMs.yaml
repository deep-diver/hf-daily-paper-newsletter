summary: GaussianProperty is a training-free framework that assigns physical properties of materials to 3D Gaussians. It uses a global-local physical property reasoning module for 2D images and projects the properties from multi-view 2D images to 3D Gaussians using a voting strategy. It can be used for physics-based dynamic simulation and robotic grasping, and its effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments....
