summary: The proposed DINO-WM world model uses pre-trained visual features and enables zero-shot planning by optimizing action sequences to achieve observational goals without relying on expert demonstrations or pre-learned inverse models. Experiments show its strong generalization capabilities across various tasks and configurations....
