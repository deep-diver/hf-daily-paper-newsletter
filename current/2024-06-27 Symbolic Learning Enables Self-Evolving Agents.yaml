summary: The paper proposes a framework called agent symbolic learning that enables language agents to optimize themselves in a data-centric way. It involves treating agents as symbolic networks and using natural language simulacrums of weights, loss, and gradients to mimic connectionist learning algorithms. The framework is tested on benchmarks and real-world tasks, resulting in self-evolving agents that can update themselves after being created and deployed....
