summary: This study presents DeeptraceReward, a new benchmark that helps identify and understand the signs that humans use to detect AI-generated videos. The researchers trained a language model to recognize these signs and found that it was better at identifying fake videos than a popular language model, GPT-5. The study also found that it's easier for humans and models to tell if a video is fake or real, but harder to pinpoint the exact signs of fakeness, especially in terms of timing....
