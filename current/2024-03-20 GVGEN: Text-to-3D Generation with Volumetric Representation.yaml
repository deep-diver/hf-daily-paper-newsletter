summary: This paper proposes GVGEN, a diffusion-based framework that generates 3D
  Gaussian representations from text input using a structured volumetric representation
  and coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, resulting in high-quality and efficient
  3D generation with fast rendering capabilities....
