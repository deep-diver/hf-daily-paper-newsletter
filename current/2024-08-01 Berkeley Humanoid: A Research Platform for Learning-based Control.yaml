summary: Berkeley Humanoid is a humanoid research platform for learning-based control that is reliable, low-cost, and designed for learning algorithms with low simulation complexity, anthropomorphic motion, and high reliability against falls. It has a narrow sim-to-real gap, enabling agile and robust locomotion across various terrains in outdoor environments. The robot can traverse for hundreds of meters, walk on a steep unpaved trail, and hop with single and double legs. It is capable of omnidirectional...
