summary: The study presents a new method called PhysRig, which improves upon traditional skinning and rigging techniques by incorporating physics-based principles. This approach allows for more realistic and flexible modeling of articulated objects, such as those with soft tissues or elastic materials, by using a volumetric representation and differentiable simulation, outperforming conventional methods in various categories and motion patterns....
