summary: The proposed ThinkDiff approach enhances text-to-image diffusion models with multimodal in-context understanding and reasoning abilities by utilizing vision-language models (VLMs). ThinkDiff overcomes existing challenges in multimodal diffusion finetuning by leveraging VLMs as a proxy task with an LLM decoder, significantly improving accuracy on the CoBSAT benchmark without complex training or datasets....
