summary: The study identifies and solves a stability issue in implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods, which are more efficient than explicit CoT reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed SIM-CoT method introduces step-level supervision during training to create distinct and meaningful latent states, improving both accuracy and stability for various implicit CoT methods, and even outperforming explicit CoT on some models....
