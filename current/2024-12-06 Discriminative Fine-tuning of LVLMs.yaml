summary: This paper proposes a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that combines the best of contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and LVLMs. The approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding. The contributions include a carefully designed training/optimization framework, a parameter-efficient adaptation metho...
