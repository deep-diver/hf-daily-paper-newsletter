summary: This paper proposes using hand-drawn sketches as a way for users to specify goals in visual imitation learning. The paper presents RT-Sketch, a policy that takes a sketch of the desired scene as input and outputs actions. RT-Sketch is trained on paired trajectories and corresponding synthetic goal sketches, and is evaluated on six manipulation skills. Experimentally, RT-Sketch performs well in straightforward settings and is more robust when language goals are ambiguous or visual distractors are...
