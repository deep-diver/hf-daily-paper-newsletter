summary: The study presents a new approach to reward modeling by creating a policy discriminator that measures the difference between two policies to generate a reward signal, guiding the training policy towards a desired target policy. The proposed method, called Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), trains a reward model to discern identical policies and discriminate different ones, capturing the relative difference between one policy and an arbitrary target policy. POLAR outperforms traditional meth...
