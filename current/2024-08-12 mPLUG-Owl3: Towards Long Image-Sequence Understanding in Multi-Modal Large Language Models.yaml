summary: This paper introduces mPLUG-Owl3, a versatile multi-modal large language model that improves the understanding of long image sequences by integrating vision and language into a common semantic space. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks and demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs....
