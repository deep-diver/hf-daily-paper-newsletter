summary: We propose a method called CamTrol that allows for camera movement control in off-the-shelf video diffusion models without any training. It works by rearranging noisy pixels in latents to change the content of the video and by modeling image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Our method can generate videos with camera motion using the layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. It is robust and can produce impressive results ...
