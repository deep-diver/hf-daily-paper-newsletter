summary: 'The authors present a method to improve neural audio models by adding a ''Re-Bottleneck'' to the autoencoder, which imposes a specific latent structure without reducing reconstruction quality. This new framework is tested in three ways: enforcing order in latent channels, aligning latents with semantic embeddings, and introducing equivariance, all of which enhance the model''s performance for various applications....'
