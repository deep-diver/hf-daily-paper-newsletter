summary: This paper suggests Chain of Manipulations, a mechanism that enables Vision-Language
  Models to solve complex visual problems by performing a series of operations on
  the input. The paper presents CogCoM, a large model trained using this mechanism,
  which achieves state-of-the-art performance....
