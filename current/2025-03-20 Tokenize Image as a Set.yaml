summary: The paper suggests a new way to represent images as a set of tokens, allowing for dynamic allocation of coding capacity based on regional semantic complexity. To model these sets, they propose a dual transformation mechanism and a novel framework called Fixed-Sum Discrete Diffusion, which handles discrete values, fixed sequence length, and summation invariance, demonstrating superior semantic-aware representation and generation quality....
