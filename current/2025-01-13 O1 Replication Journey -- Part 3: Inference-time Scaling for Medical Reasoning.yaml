summary: This paper investigates the potential of inference-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) for medical reasoning tasks. It reveals that increasing inference time leads to improved performance, and task complexity directly correlates with the required length of reasoning chains. The model adheres to the principles of the hypothetico-deductive method, producing a list of potential conditions that may explain a patient's symptoms and systematically narrowing these possibilities by evaluating t...
