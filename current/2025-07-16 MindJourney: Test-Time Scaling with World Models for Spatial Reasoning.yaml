summary: The authors present a method called MindJourney, which helps vision-language models understand 3D spatial reasoning by combining them with a controllable world model. This approach allows the model to anticipate changes in a scene after movement, improving its performance on spatial reasoning tasks by an average of 8% without any additional training....
