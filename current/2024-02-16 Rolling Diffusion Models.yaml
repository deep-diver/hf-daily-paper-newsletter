summary: This paper introduces Rolling Diffusion, a new denoising process for temporal data that assigns more noise to later frames, reflecting greater uncertainty about the future. Empirical results demonstrate that Rolling Diffusion performs better than standard diffusion when temporal dynamics are complex, particularly in video prediction tasks and fluid dynamics forecasting experiments....
