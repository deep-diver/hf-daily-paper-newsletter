summary: This paper introduces Rolling Diffusion, a new denoising process for temporal
  data that assigns more noise to later frames, reflecting greater uncertainty about
  the future. Empirical results demonstrate that Rolling Diffusion performs better
  than standard diffusion when temporal dynamics are complex, particularly in video
  prediction tasks and fluid dynamics forecasting experiments....
