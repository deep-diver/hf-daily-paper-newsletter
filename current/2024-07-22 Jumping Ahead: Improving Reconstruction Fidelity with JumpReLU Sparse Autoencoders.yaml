summary: This paper introduces JumpReLU Sparse Autoencoders, a simple modification of vanilla SAEs that achieves better reconstruction fidelity at a given sparsity level on Gemma 2 9B activations compared to other recent advances. The improvement does not compromise interpretability, and JumpReLU SAEs are efficient to train and run. They use straight-through-estimators to train effectively and directly train L0 to be sparse, avoiding problems like shrinkage....
