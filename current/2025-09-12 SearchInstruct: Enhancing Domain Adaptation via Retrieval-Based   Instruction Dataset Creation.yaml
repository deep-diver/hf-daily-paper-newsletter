summary: The authors present SearchInstruct, a novel method to build high-quality instruction datasets for fine-tuning large language models, particularly in specialized domains. This approach starts with a small set of domain-specific questions, expands them using a language model, and retrieves relevant resources to generate accurate answers, resulting in improved model performance and efficient updates....
