summary: The paper introduces 3D-MoLM, a language model that can analyze 3D molecules by integrating a 3D molecular encoder. This is achieved through a 3D molecule-text projector and a curated dataset called 3D-MoIT. 3D-MoLM outperforms existing baselines on downstream tasks, such as molecule-text retrieval, captioning, and QA, especially for 3D-dependent properties....
