summary: This study presents a new method for training a smartphone camera's image processor using deep learning, which eliminates the need for expensive and difficult-to-obtain paired data. The proposed approach uses a multi-term loss function and adversarial training with multiple discriminators to learn color and texture characteristics from a target RGB dataset, resulting in high-quality images with lightweight neural network architectures suitable for mobile devices....
