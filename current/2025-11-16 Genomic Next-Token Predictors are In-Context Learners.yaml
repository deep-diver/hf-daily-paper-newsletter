summary: This study examines if genomic models, like language models, can learn patterns from examples within their input (in-context learning) by training on predicting nucleotides. The results show that genomic models do exhibit this learning behavior, suggesting that in-context learning is a general property of large-scale predictive modeling, not just specific to language....
