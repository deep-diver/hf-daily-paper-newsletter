summary: Free4D is a new, efficient framework for generating 4D scenes from a single image, without the need for tuning. It distills pre-trained foundation models to offer consistent 4D scene representation, using animation of the input image, adaptive guidance mechanism, and modulation-based refinement for generating consistent 4D representation....
