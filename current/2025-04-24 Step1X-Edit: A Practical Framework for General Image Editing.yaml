summary: Researchers created Step1X-Edit, an advanced image editing model that rivals closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. They used a multimodal LLM to process images and instructions, extracting latent embeddings to generate target images using a diffusion decoder. Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source models and is close to the performance of proprietary models, as demonstrated by the GEdit-Bench benchmark....
