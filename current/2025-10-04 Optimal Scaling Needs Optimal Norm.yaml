summary: 'The study finds that the optimal scaling of models and datasets is governed by a single invariant: the operator norm of the output layer. By using the Scion optimizer, the researchers discover a phenomenon called norm transfer, where the optimal learning rate and batch size pair consistently have the same operator norm value, which can help improve model performance and provide practical insights for training large language models....'
