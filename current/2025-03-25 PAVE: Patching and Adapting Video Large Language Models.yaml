summary: The paper proposes a framework named PAVE for adapting pre-trained video language models (Video LLMs) to new tasks with side-channel signals, such as audio or 3D information, using lightweight adapters. PAVE significantly improves the performance of the base model across various tasks, including audio-visual question answering and 3D reasoning, while incurring minimal additional computational cost and supporting multi-task learning....
