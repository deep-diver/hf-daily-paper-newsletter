summary: The study presents a new framework called LangScene-X that can create generalizable 3D scenes with language information from just a few images. This framework uses a special model to generate details like colors, shapes, and meanings from those images and a language compressor to make it work for different scenes without needing to be retrained. Tests show that it works better than existing methods in creating high-quality and adaptable 3D scenes....
