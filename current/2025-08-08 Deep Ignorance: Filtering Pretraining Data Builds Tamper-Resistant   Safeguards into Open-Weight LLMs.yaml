summary: This study explores how removing certain topics from the training data of open-weight AI systems can make them less susceptible to tampering attacks. The researchers developed a pipeline for filtering text and trained several models, finding that they were significantly more resistant to attacks compared to existing methods, without losing other capabilities. However, they also discovered that these models could still access dangerous information if provided in context, suggesting that multiple ...
