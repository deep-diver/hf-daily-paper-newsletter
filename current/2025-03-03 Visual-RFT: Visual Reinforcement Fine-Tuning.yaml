summary: Visual-RFT is a method that applies reinforcement fine-tuning to visual tasks using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It generates multiple responses for each input, using verifiable reward functions like IoU for object detection, and updates the model via policy optimization algorithms. Visual-RFT outperforms supervised fine-tuning in fine-grained image classification, few-shot object detection, and reasoning grounding tasks, improving accuracy by 24.3% in one-shot fine-grained image classi...
