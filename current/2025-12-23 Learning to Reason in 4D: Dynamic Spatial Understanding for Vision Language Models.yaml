summary: This study presents a new method for improving dynamic spatial reasoning in vision-language models by introducing a suite called DSR Suite. The suite includes an automated pipeline for generating multiple-choice questions from videos, a lightweight Geometry Selection Module to integrate geometric information into the models, and a new dataset that emphasizes real-world video sources and detailed 3D information. The result is a significant enhancement in the dynamic spatial reasoning capabilities...
