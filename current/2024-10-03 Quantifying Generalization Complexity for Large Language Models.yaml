summary: Scylla is a dynamic evaluation framework that measures the generalization abilities of large language models by assessing performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. It reveals a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, called the generalization valley. Larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-reliance on memorization, with a critical complexity threshold indicating the upper bound of generalizat...
