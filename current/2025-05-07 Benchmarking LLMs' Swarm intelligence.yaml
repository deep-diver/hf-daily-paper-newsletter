summary: The study presents SwarmBench, a new benchmark for testing the swarm intelligence of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems, focusing on their ability to coordinate in decentralized scenarios with limited local perception and communication. The benchmark reveals varying performance levels among LLMs, highlighting challenges in planning and strategy formation under uncertainty, and provides an open toolkit to advance research in LLM-based coordination and embodied multi-agent systems...
