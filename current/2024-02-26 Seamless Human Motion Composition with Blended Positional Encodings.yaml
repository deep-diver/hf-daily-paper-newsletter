summary: The paper introduces FlowMDM, a new model that generates long, continuous
  sequences of human motion guided by textual descriptions. It uses a technique called
  Blended Positional Encodings to create seamless transitions and achieve state-of-the-art
  results on accuracy, realism, and smoothness. The model is robust against varying
  text descriptions and the authors propose two new metrics to evaluate human motion
  compositions....
