summary: The paper introduces FlowMDM, a new model that generates long, continuous sequences of human motion guided by textual descriptions. It uses a technique called Blended Positional Encodings to create seamless transitions and achieve state-of-the-art results on accuracy, realism, and smoothness. The model is robust against varying text descriptions and the authors propose two new metrics to evaluate human motion compositions....
