summary: This study presents a new algorithm called one-token rollout (OTR) that improves supervised fine-tuning of large language models by incorporating elements of reinforcement learning. OTR enhances the model's generalization ability by using the policy gradient method to treat each token generation as a single-step learning process, making it more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning....
