summary: The study presents a new method called Spatial Forcing to improve the spatial awareness of robots following language instructions, without relying on 3D sensors or depth estimators. This approach enhances the precision of robotic actions and accelerates training, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both simulation and real-world environments....
