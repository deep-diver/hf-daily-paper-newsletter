summary: This paper introduces TexGen, a method for generating 3D textures that correspond to textual descriptions. It uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and a multi-view sampling and resampling framework to create textures with high view consistency and rich appearance details. It also allows for texture editing while preserving the original identity. You can see more results at dong-huo.github.io/TexGen.)...
