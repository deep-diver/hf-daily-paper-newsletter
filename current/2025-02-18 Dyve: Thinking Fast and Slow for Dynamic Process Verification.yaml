summary: The presented Dyve is a dynamic process verifier that improves error detection in large language models by combining fast and slow thinking, inspired by Kahneman's Systems Theory. It utilizes a step-wise consensus-filtered process supervision technique to create high-quality supervision signals from noisy data and outperforms existing process-based verifiers....
