summary: The authors present a new method called SceneDINO that infers 3D geometry and semantics from a single image without relying on costly annotations. This approach uses multi-view consistency self-supervision and reaches state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy in both 3D and 2D unsupervised scene understanding....
