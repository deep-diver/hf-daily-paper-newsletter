summary: The authors present a Unified Flow & Matching model (UFM) that improves the accuracy and speed of dense image correspondence tasks, like visual odometry and 3D reconstruction, by training on co-visible pixels in both source and target images. UFM, using a simple transformer architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in optical flow estimation and wide-baseline scenarios, making it a promising tool for various correspondence tasks....
