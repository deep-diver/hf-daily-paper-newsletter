summary: The proposed framework combines 3D geometry and dynamic awareness for video generation. It uses 3D point trajectories to align with 2D videos, introducing a 3D-aware video dataset PointVid to train a latent diffusion model. This model, with 3D-regularized shape and motion, enhances RGB video quality and handles complex interactions, reducing undesired artifacts like object morphing....
