summary: This paper presents the Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project, which aims to train agents to follow natural language instructions in various 3D environments. The goal is to develop an agent that can accomplish any human task in a simulated 3D world, using a generic human-like interface and without making strong assumptions. The authors outline their approach and share promising preliminary results from diverse research environments and commercial video games....
