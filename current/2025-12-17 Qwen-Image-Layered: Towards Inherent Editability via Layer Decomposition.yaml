summary: 'The study presents a new method called Qwen-Image-Layered that breaks down images into separate layers, similar to professional design tools, enabling edits to specific parts without affecting the rest. This is achieved through three main components: a unifying model for RGB and RGBA images, a variable layer decomposition architecture, and a multi-stage training strategy. The researchers also created a pipeline to generate high-quality training images and found that their method outperforms exis...'
