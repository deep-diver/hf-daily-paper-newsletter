summary: The MolmoAct model is a new type of vision-language-action model that can reason about space to perform tasks more adaptively and generally than existing robotic models. It outperforms other models in various simulations and real-world settings, and its performance improves further with a newly released dataset. The model and its training code, along with the dataset, are made publicly available....
