summary: This work presents a novel framework called Set-and-Sequence for personalizing text-to-video models with dynamic concepts. The approach involves a two-stage fine-tuning process using Low-Rank Adaptation layers, first learning identity basis for appearance and then capturing motion dynamics to embed dynamic concepts into the video model's output domain....
