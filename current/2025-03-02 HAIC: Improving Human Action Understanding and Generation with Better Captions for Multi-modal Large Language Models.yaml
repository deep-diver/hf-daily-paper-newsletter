summary: The authors present HAIC, a two-stage data annotation pipeline for enhancing multi-modal large language models' understanding of human actions. They collected and annotated a large dataset called HAICTrain, and another dataset called HAICBench for evaluation. Experiments show that training with HAICTrain significantly improves human action understanding and text-to-video generation....
