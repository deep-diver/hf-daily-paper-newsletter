summary: This paper proposes a framework called MM-Detect to detect data contamination in multimodal large language models, which are used to perform various tasks involving text and images. The framework is designed to work with different types of data and training processes, and it can help identify when the model has been trained on data that it should not have access to, which can improve performance. The paper also explores how contamination can occur during different stages of the training process ...
