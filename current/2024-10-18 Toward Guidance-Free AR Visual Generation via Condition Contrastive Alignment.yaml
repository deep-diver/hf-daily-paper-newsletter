summary: This paper proposes a new method called Condition Contrastive Alignment (CCA) to improve the quality of visual generative models without the need for guidance-free AR visual generation. CCA fine-tunes pretrained models to fit the same distribution target and can significantly enhance the guidance-free performance of all tested models with just one epoch of fine-tuning. This method also allows for trade-offs between sample diversity and fidelity similar to CFG, unifying two previously independent...
