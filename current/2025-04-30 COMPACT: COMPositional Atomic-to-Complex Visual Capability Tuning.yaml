summary: The authors present a new method called COMPACT to improve the performance of multimodal large language models on complex visual-language tasks. By generating a training dataset with controlled compositional complexity, COMPACT enables models to efficiently learn complex capabilities and outperforms traditional visual instruction tuning, especially on tasks requiring multiple atomic capabilities....
