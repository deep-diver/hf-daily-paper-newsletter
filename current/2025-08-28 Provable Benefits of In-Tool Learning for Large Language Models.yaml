summary: 'This study compares two methods of language model learning: in-weight learning (memorization) and in-tool learning (external retrieval). The researchers found that while memorization has a limit based on the model''s parameters, in-tool learning allows for unlimited factual recall through efficient circuit construction. They also discovered that teaching tool-use to pre-trained language models is more effective than memorizing facts....'
