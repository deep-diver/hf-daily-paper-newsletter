summary: In this paper, we propose a training-free method for video interpolation to generate high frame rate videos from low frame rate videos. We investigate the non-linearity in the feature space of video diffusion models and propose a self-cascaded video diffusion model with hidden state correction modules to retain temporal consistency between key frames and interpolated frames. We evaluate our method on multiple popular video models and show that it is effective and even comparable to trained inter...
