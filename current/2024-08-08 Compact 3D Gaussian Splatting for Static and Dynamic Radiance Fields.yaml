summary: The paper introduces a new method for representing 3D scenes that is faster and uses less memory than previous methods, while still producing high-quality images. It does this by reducing the number of Gaussian points and using a neural network to represent the colors and covariances. The authors also use codebooks to represent the geometric and temporal attributes, and use model compression techniques to further reduce the memory usage. The method is tested on both static and dynamic scenes, an...
