summary: The authors propose a new method called DPO-Kernels to improve the alignment of large language models with different values and preferences. This method uses kernel methods to create richer representations and offers more options for stability. It also includes a data-driven selection process to choose the best options and a hierarchical mixture of kernels for better modeling. The method performs well in various tasks and maintains robust generalization for large language models....
