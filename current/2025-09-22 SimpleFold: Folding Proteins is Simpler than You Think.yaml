summary: The authors present a new protein folding model, SimpleFold, which uses general-purpose transformer blocks instead of complex, domain-specific architectures. This model achieves competitive performance on standard folding benchmarks, demonstrates strong ensemble prediction, and is efficient for deployment and inference on consumer-level hardware....
