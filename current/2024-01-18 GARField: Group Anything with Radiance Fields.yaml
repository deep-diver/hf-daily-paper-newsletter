summary: This paper introduces GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. It embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field, which allows a point in the world to belong to different groups of different sizes. It evaluates GARField on various in-the-wild scenes and finds it effectively extracts groups at many levels, and has potential downstream applications such as...
