summary: This paper presents GARField, an approach for decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups from posed image inputs. GARField embraces group ambiguity through physical scale by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field. The field can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via automatic tree construction or user interaction. GARField effectively extracts groups at different levels and represents multi-view consistent groupings with higher fidelity than ...
