summary: The ability for AI agents to "think with images" requires a sophisticated blend of reasoning and perception. However, current open multimodal agents still largely fall short on the reasoning aspect crucial for real-world tasks like analyzing documents with dense charts/diagrams and navigating maps. To address this gap, we introduce O3-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning with interleaved attention to visual details. O3-Bench features challenging problems that require ...
