summary: The study presents a new benchmark, O3-Bench, to evaluate multimodal reasoning in AI agents, which requires them to analyze visual details in images through multi-step reasoning. To enhance this capability, the researchers developed InSight-o3, a framework that includes a visual search agent capable of locating complex regions described in natural language, improving the performance of state-of-the-art multimodal models on various benchmarks....
