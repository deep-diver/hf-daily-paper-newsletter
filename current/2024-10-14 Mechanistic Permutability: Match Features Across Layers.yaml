summary: In this paper, we propose a new method called SAE Match to align features extracted by Sparse Autoencoders across different layers of a neural network. Our approach minimizes the mean squared error between the folded parameters of SAEs and improves feature matching quality. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on the Gemma 2 language model and show that features persist over several layers. Our work advances the understanding of feature dynamics in neural networks and provides a new tool fo...
