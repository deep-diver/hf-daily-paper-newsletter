summary: The authors present GLiClass, a new method based on GLiNER architecture for sequence classification tasks, which offers high accuracy and efficiency similar to embedding-based methods while being adaptable for zero-shot and few-shot learning. They also improved PPO for multi-label text classification, allowing training classifiers in data-sparse conditions or with human feedback....
