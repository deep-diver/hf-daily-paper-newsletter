summary: The study presents ORIGEN, a novel zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding in text-to-image generation, tackling the limitation of previous methods that only controlled 2D positioning. A reward-guided sampling approach using a pretrained discriminative model for 3D orientation estimation and a text-to-image flow model is introduced, with Langevin dynamics and adaptive time rescaling used to maintain image realism and accelerate convergence....
