summary: 'The authors propose ERA, a two-stage framework that combines prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning to enhance the performance of vision language models in complex environments. ERA improves agent performance through three key designs: self-summarization, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization, and demonstrates superior results compared to large models and previous baselines in various tasks....'
