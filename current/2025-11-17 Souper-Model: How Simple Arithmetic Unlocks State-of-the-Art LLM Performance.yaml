summary: The authors present a new method called SoCE for improving Large Language Models' performance through model souping, which involves averaging weights from multiple models. SoCE identifies expert models for each category cluster and combines them using optimized weighted averaging, resulting in improved performance and robustness across multiple domains and state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard....
