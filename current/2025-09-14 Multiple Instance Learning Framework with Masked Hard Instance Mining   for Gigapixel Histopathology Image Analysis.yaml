summary: This study presents a new learning method that focuses on challenging instances within large pathology images to improve accuracy in computational pathology tasks like cancer diagnosis and survival analysis. The proposed framework uses a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore hard instances, a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and mine hard ones, and a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Experimental results show that this method outpe...
