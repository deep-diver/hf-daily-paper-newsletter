summary: This study investigates how different optimizers affect model performance when quantized, focusing on both post-training and quantization-aware training methods. The results reveal that optimizers which perform well during original training may not be the best for quantization, with Shampoo showing the least accuracy loss and the highest parameter efficiency under quantization-aware training....
