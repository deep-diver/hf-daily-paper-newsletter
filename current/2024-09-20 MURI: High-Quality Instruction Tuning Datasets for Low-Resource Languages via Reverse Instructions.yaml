summary: This paper presents a new method, MURI, to create high-quality instruction tuning datasets for low-resource languages without human annotators. It generates instruction-output pairs from existing texts in these languages and ensures cultural relevance. The resulting dataset, MURI-IT, includes over 2 million pairs across 200 languages, and experiments show its effectiveness for both understanding and generating text. The datasets and models are available at https://github.com/akoksal/muri....
