summary: This paper introduces the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD) algorithm for concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for videos, which includes identifying units of video transformer representations - concepts and ranking their importance. The resulting concepts reveal spatio-temporal reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models, and this analysis helps in improving model performance for fine-grained tasks....
