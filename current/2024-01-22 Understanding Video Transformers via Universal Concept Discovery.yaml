summary: This paper introduces the first Video Transformer Concept Discovery (VTCD)
  algorithm for concept-based interpretability of transformer representations for
  videos, which includes identifying units of video transformer representations -
  concepts and ranking their importance. The resulting concepts reveal spatio-temporal
  reasoning mechanisms and object-centric representations in unstructured video models,
  and this analysis helps in improving model performance for fine-grained tasks....
