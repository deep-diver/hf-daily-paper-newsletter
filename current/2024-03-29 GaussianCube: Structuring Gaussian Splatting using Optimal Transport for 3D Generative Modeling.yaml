summary: The paper proposes GaussianCube, a structured representation for 3D generative modeling. It uses Optimal Transport to arrange Gaussians into a predefined voxel grid and a modified GS fitting algorithm to achieve high-quality results. Experiments show state-of-the-art generation results on ShapeNet and OmniObject3D....
