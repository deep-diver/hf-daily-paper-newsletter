summary: 'This study presents a novel theoretical framework that improves text-to-image models'' performance on multi-subject descriptions by introducing two algorithms: a test-time controller and a fine-tuning rule. These algorithms enhance subject disentanglement and multi-subject fidelity while preserving the base model''s capabilities, and they are architecture-agnostic and efficient to run....'
