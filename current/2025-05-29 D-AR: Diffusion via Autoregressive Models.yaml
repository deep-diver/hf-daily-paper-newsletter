summary: The authors propose a new method called D-AR that uses autoregressive models to generate images by turning the diffusion process into a sequence of discrete tokens. This approach allows for consistent previews and layout-controlled synthesis, and it achieves high performance on the ImageNet benchmark using a large language model backbone....
