summary: This paper investigates the perception and cognitive abilities of large language and vision models (LLVMs) by evaluating their performance across 10 benchmarks. The study reveals that LLVMs internally process images globally, can solve math problems without fully perceiving numerical information, and have cross-modal alignment overfitted to complex reasoning tasks. The representation space in the lower layers plays a crucial role in determining performance and enhancing visual understanding. The...
