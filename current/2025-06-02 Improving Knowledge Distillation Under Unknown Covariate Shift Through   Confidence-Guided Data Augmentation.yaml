summary: This study proposes a new data augmentation method using diffusion techniques to improve knowledge distillation, particularly in cases of unknown covariate shift. By generating challenging samples that maximize disagreement between a teacher and student model, the approach significantly enhances accuracy and robustness on various datasets compared to existing methods....
