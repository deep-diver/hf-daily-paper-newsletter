summary: The authors propose a new method called D2E that uses data from desktop environments, specifically gaming, to pretrain models for embodied AI tasks. By collecting and compressing diverse desktop interactions, predicting game events, and transferring desktop-pretrained representations to physical tasks, the proposed framework achieves high success rates in manipulation and navigation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of desktop pretraining for robotics....
