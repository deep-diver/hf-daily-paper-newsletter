summary: The paper presents SERL, a software suite that simplifies the use of robotic reinforcement learning by providing a carefully implemented library with an off-policy deep RL method, reward computation, environment resetting, high-quality controller, and challenging example tasks. The implementation achieved efficient and robust learning in complex tasks, such as PCB board assembly, cable routing, and object relocation, with an average of 25-50 minutes of training per policy....
