summary: We present Agent Workflow Memory (AWM), a method that helps language model-based agents solve complex long-horizon tasks by learning and reusing routines from past experiences. AWM improves baseline results by 24.6% and 51.1% relative success rate on two major web navigation benchmarks while reducing the number of steps taken to solve tasks. It also generalizes well in different scenarios and outperforms baselines by 8.9 to 14.0 absolute points as train-test task distribution gaps widen....
