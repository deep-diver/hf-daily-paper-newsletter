summary: This paper introduces a method for cross-lingual alignment using reward model transfer, which allows for the reuse of human-annotated preference data in one language to align language models in other languages. The method is shown to be consistently successful, with cross-lingually aligned models preferred by humans over unaligned models in up to 70% of evaluation instances, and sometimes even better than same-language reward models. The paper also identifies best practices when language-specifi...
