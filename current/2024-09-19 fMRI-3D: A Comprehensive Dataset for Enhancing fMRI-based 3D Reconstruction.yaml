summary: This paper introduces the fMRI-3D dataset and MinD-3D framework for reconstructing 3D visuals from fMRI data, which can help cognitive neuroscience and computer vision. The dataset includes data from 15 participants and features 4768 3D objects, significantly enhancing diversity and potential applications. MinD-3D uses a neuro-fusion encoder, feature-bridge diffusion model, and generative transformer decoder to decode 3D visual information from fMRI signals. The paper establishes new benchmarks ...
