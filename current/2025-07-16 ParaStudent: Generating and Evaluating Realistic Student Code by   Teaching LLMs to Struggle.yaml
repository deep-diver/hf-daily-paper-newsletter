summary: The study explores generating realistic student code using Large Language Models (LLMs) by mimicking real students' imperfect, iterative, and diverse coding styles. Through various experiments and fine-tuning, the researchers successfully model student progress and capture error patterns, improvements, and stylistic variations, emphasizing the importance of context-aware generation, temporal modeling, and multi-dimensional evaluation....
