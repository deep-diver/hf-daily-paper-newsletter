summary: This research focuses on enhancing the robustness of text encoders in CLIP, an AI model, by introducing LEAF, a method for creating robust text encoders that can be scaled for large CLIP models. The improved text encoders help maintain performance in various applications like text-to-image generation and multimodal retrieval tasks, even under adversarial attacks....
