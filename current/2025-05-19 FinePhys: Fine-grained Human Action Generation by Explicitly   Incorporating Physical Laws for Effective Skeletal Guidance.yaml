summary: The study presents a new method called FinePhys that generates realistic human actions by incorporating physics laws. This approach improves the accuracy and naturalness of fine-grained human actions, such as complex gymnastics routines, by estimating 2D poses, lifting them to 3D, and then refining them with physics-based motion re-estimation....
