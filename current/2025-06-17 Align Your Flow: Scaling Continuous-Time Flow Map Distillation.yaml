summary: The authors present two new continuous-time objectives and additional training techniques for improving the performance of flow map models, which connect any two noise levels in a single step for image generation. They demonstrate state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on ImageNet using small and efficient neural networks and introduce text-to-image flow map models that outperform existing non-adversarially trained few-step samplers in text-conditioned synthesis....
