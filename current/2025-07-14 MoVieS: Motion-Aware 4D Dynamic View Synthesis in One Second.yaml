summary: MoVieS is a new model that creates 4D moving images from single-lens videos quickly. It represents moving 3D scenes using grids of Gaussian shapes that change over time, allowing for a unified approach to appearance, geometry, and motion. This enables tasks like view synthesis, reconstruction, and 3D tracking in one learning-based framework, and supports various zero-shot applications, all while being fast and efficient....
