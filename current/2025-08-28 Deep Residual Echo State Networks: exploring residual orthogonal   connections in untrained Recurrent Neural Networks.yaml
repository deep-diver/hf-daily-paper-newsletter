summary: The authors propose a new type of deep, untrained Recurrent Neural Network called Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs), which improves upon traditional Echo State Networks by incorporating residual connections. This results in better long-term information processing and memory capacity, as demonstrated through mathematical analysis and experiments on various time series tasks....
