summary: The authors present Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a new framework that allows for wider representations without increasing computational costs. Experiments show that VWN significantly speeds up optimization and reduces loss, becoming more effective with scale, and identifies a log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction....
