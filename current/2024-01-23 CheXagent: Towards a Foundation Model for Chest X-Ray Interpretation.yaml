summary: CheXagent is a vision-language foundation model that can accurately interpret chest X-rays and assist physicians with clinical decision-making. It was developed using a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset called CheXinstruct and evaluated on CheXbench, a novel benchmark for CXR interpretation. CheXagent outperforms previously-developed models and is designed to be transparent with a fairness evaluation to address potential performance disparities....
