summary: The study presents a new method called I-GLIDE that improves the prediction of an item's remaining useful life by using a technique called Reconstruction along Projected Pathways and adding uncertainty quantification. This approach helps in understanding the specific causes of system failures in complex systems like aerospace and manufacturing, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions compared to existing methods....
