summary: This paper proposes a method that combines a large diffusion model with a physically based inverse rendering process to insert virtual objects into real-world scenes in a photorealistic manner, considering lighting, geometry, materials, and image formation. The method recovers scene lighting and tone-mapping parameters, allowing the composition of virtual objects in single frames or videos of indoor or outdoor scenes, and enables automatic materials and tone-mapping refinement....
