summary: The paper presents a method called VeriCoT that checks the logic of multi-step reasoning by large language models (LLMs) to ensure accuracy and reliability, using formal logical arguments and first-order logic. VeriCoT improves reasoning validity and accuracy by identifying flawed reasoning, serving as a predictor of final answer correctness, and enabling inference-time self-reflection, supervised fine-tuning, and preference fine-tuning....
