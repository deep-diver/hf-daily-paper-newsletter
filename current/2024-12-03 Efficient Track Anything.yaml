summary: EfficientTAMs is a lightweight track anything model that produces high-quality results with low latency and model size. It uses a nonhierarchical Vision Transformer as an image encoder and an efficient memory module for video object segmentation. EfficientTAMs perform comparably to SAM 2 model with faster speed and fewer parameters, and can run on mobile devices for on-device video object segmentation applications....
