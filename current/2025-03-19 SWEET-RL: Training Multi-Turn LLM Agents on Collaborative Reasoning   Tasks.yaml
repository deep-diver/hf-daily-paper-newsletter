summary: This work presents SWEET-RL, a novel RL algorithm for training LLM agents in multi-turn tasks, and introduces ColBench, a new benchmark for evaluating such agents in realistic tasks. SWEET-RL significantly outperforms other algorithms on ColBench, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving LLM agent performance in collaboration tasks....
