summary: This paper introduces ProcessBench, a tool for measuring the ability of models to identify errors in mathematical reasoning. It consists of 3,400 test cases with human-annotated error locations. The authors evaluate two types of models, process reward models and critic models, and find that existing process reward models struggle with challenging math problems while critic models, particularly the proprietary GPT-4o, perform better. The authors hope ProcessBench can help improve the reasoning pr...
