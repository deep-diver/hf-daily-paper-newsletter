summary: VARGPT-v1.1 is an upgraded visual autoregressive model that introduces a new training approach using iterative visual instruction tuning and reinforcement learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a larger training dataset, and an improved language model backbone. This leads to improved performance in multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following tasks, while also enabling image editing functionality....
