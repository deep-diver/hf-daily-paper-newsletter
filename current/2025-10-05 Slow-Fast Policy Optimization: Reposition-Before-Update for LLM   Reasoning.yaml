summary: The authors present a new framework called Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO) that improves the stability and efficiency of training large language models for reasoning tasks. SFPO reduces the need for noisy gradients, lowers the number of rollouts, and accelerates convergence, outperforming existing methods like GRPO in experiments....
