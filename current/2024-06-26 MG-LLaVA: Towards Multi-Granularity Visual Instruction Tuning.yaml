summary: MG-LLaVA is a new type of model that can look at pictures better by using different ways to understand the pictures. This helps the model to do better at tasks that need to understand details in pictures. The model was trained using instruction tuning and can be used with different types of language encoders. It does better than other similar models of the same size on different tests....
