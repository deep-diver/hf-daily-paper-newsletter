summary: The authors present a new method for LiDAR-camera calibration that uses bird's-eye view features, which can be extracted from raw data and fused into a shared feature space. This approach, called BEVCALIB, is more efficient and accurate than traditional methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various datasets and outperforming other baselines by a significant margin....
