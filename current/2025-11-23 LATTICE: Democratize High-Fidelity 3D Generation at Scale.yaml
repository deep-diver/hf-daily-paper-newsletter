summary: The authors introduce LATTICE, a new framework that makes high-quality 3D asset generation more accessible and efficient by introducing VoxSet, a semi-structured representation that simplifies 3D data and enables structured generation. This framework uses a two-stage pipeline to first create a sparse 3D geometry anchor and then generate detailed surfaces, outperforming existing methods and offering a more scalable solution for high-fidelity 3D asset creation....
