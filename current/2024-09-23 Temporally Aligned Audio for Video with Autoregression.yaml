summary: V-AURA is a new system that makes better sounds for videos by understanding what's happening in the video and making sure the sounds are happening at the right time. It uses a special way to look at the video and combine it with sounds, and they made a new group of videos to train it on. V-AURA is better than other systems at making sure the sounds match the video, but it still makes good sounds....
