summary: The study presents SyncMV4D, a model that generates synchronized multi-view videos and 4D motions for hand-object interaction, overcoming limitations of current methods that either rely on single-view videos or high-quality 3D data. SyncMV4D uses a new model and aligner to co-generate videos and motions, and establishes a feedback loop to improve 2D appearance and 4D dynamics, resulting in superior visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency compared to existing methods....
