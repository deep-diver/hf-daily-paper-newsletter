summary: The paper presents a benchmark called SafeRAG to evaluate the security of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. RAG systems are vulnerable to various attacks, such as silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service, which can degrade the service quality. The SafeRAG dataset is used to simulate these attacks, and experiments on 14 RAG components reveal significant vulnerability to these attacks....
