summary: This paper shows that linear transformers, a type of machine learning model, can implicitly execute gradient-descent-like algorithms and discover sophisticated optimization strategies, even in challenging scenarios with noisy data. The paper also reverse-engineers the algorithm used by linear transformers in this scenario and shows that it incorporates momentum and adaptive rescaling based on noise levels....
