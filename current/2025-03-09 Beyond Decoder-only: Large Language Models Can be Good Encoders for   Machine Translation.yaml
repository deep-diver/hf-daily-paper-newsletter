summary: The paper investigates using large language models (LLMs) as encoders in neural machine translation (NMT) models, which have traditionally used encoder-decoder architectures. The authors propose methods to optimize LLMs for NMT encoding and evaluate their system's performance, which matches or outperforms baselines with significantly faster inference speed and reduced memory footprint, demonstrating strong generalization across various translation tasks....
