summary: The study examines how Video Large Language Models process video and text information, discovering that early-to-middle layers actively interact with frames for temporal reasoning, followed by integration of video and language in middle layers, enabling correct answers in later layers. By selectively retaining effective information pathways and suppressing excess attention edges, these models can maintain their performance while improving interpretability and generalization....
