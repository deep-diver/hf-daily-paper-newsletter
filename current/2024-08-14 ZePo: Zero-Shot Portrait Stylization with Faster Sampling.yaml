summary: This paper introduces an inversion-free portrait stylization framework based on diffusion models that accomplishes content and style feature fusion in just four sampling steps. The framework uses Latent Consistency Models to extract representative Consistency Features from noisy images and introduces a Style Enhancement Attention Control technique to merge content and style features within the attention space of the target image.
