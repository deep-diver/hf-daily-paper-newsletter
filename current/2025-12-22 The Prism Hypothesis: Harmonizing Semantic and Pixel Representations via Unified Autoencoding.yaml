summary: This study explores the connection between a neural network encoder's feature spectrum and its role, discovering that semantic encoders focus on low-frequency, abstract components, while pixel encoders also capture high-frequency, detailed information. They introduce a new model called Unified Autoencoding that combines these semantic and pixel representations, demonstrating improved performance on popular image datasets....
