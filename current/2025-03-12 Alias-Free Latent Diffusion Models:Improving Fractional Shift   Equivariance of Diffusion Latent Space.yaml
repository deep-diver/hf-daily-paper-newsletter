summary: The paper redesigns Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to improve their consistency by making them shift-equivariant, which helps to reduce aliasing and inconsistency caused by unique challenges in LDMs such as aliasing amplification and self-attention modules that lack shift-equivariance. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is more consistent in results than vanilla LDM across various applications....
