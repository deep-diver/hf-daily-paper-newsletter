summary: This paper introduces a new way to filter image-text data using fine-tuned Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). The proposed approach outperforms existing methods and produces more precise and comprehensive scores, directly improving the quality of filtered data and boosting the performance of pre-trained models. The MLM filter can be used as a drop-in replacement for CLIPScore and is effective across different models and tasks....
