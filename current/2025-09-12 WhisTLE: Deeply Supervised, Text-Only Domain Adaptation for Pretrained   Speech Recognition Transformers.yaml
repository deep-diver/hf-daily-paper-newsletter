summary: The authors present WhisTLE, a method to adapt pretrained speech recognition models to new domains using only text data. WhisTLE uses a variational autoencoder to model encoder outputs from text and fine-tunes the decoder, resulting in improved performance across various out-of-domain datasets and ASR models....
