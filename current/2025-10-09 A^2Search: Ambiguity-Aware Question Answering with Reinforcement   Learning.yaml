summary: The study presents A^2Search, a new framework for question answering that can handle multiple valid answers without relying on manual annotation, which is particularly useful for complex datasets. This method uses an automated pipeline to detect ambiguous questions and gather alternative answers, then optimizes the model with reinforcement learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks....
