summary: The authors present GSFixer, a new method that enhances the quality of 3D scene reconstructions from sparse views using 3D Gaussian Splatting. They address the issue of inconsistent content generation in previous approaches by integrating both 2D and 3D features from reference views, leading to improved semantic coherence and 3D consistency. Additionally, they introduce a new benchmark called DL3DV-Res for evaluating 3D Gaussian Splatting artifact restoration, and their method outperforms existi...
