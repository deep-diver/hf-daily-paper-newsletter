summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. The authors examine the factors that impact the learning performance and find that naive implementations take more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. They propose a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts workers' local training steps based on their computation speed, resulting in improved performance....
