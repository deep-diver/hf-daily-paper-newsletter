summary: This paper presents an empirical study of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. The authors find that without optimizations, asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD. They identify acceleration on the global parameters when worker gradients are stale as a key challenge. The authors propose a novel method that applies a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed to match ...
