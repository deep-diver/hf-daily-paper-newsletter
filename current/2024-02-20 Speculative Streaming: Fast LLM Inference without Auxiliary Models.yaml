summary: This paper proposes a new method called Speculative Streaming that speeds up language model inference without the need for auxiliary models. It achieves this by changing the fine-tuning objective to predict future n-grams instead of just the next token. This method is faster and more efficient than other methods, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices....
