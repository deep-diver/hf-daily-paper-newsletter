summary: The study introduces DenseWorld, a benchmark for 25 real-world dense prediction tasks, and proposes DenseDiT, a model that uses generative models' visual priors to perform these tasks with minimal additional parameters. DenseDiT significantly outperforms existing models in real-world scenarios with limited training data, making it practical for real-world deployment....
