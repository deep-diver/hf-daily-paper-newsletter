summary: The authors address the issue of 3D Gaussian Splatting's limited generalization in novel viewpoints by proposing Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR). FASR improves 3DGS's ability to reconstruct high-frequency details and fine details, outperforming other methods across various datasets....
