summary: This paper shows that applying guidance in a limited interval improves the quality of images generated by diffusion models, by restricting guidance to a specific range of noise levels, which speeds up inference and improves result quality. This method significantly improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 and is beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets....
