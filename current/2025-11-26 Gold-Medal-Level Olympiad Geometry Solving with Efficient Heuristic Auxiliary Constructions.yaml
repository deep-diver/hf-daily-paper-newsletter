summary: The authors present HAGeo, a heuristic-based method for geometry theorem proving that outperforms neural network-based approaches, achieving gold-medal level performance on the IMO-30 benchmark. They also introduce HAGeo-409, a more challenging benchmark with 409 problems, to provide a more precise evaluation for geometry theorem proving....
