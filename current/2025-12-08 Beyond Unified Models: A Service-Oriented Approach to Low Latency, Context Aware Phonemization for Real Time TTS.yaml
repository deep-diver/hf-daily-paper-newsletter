summary: This study presents a new framework for text-to-speech systems that balances the need for high-quality pronunciation with the requirement for real-time performance. By using a service-oriented architecture and lightweight strategies, the proposed system separates context-aware components from the core TTS engine, reducing latency and enabling real-time use of advanced phonemization models without sacrificing accuracy....
