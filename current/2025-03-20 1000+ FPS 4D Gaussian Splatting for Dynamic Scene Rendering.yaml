summary: This study addresses the issues of storage and rendering speed in 4D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. It introduces a new pruning criterion to reduce short-lifespan Gaussians and stores a mask for active Gaussians to significantly reduce redundant computations, resulting in a 41x storage reduction and 9x faster rasterization speed compared to vanilla 4DGS....
