summary: 'Large-scale text-to-image models enable a wide range of image editing techniques, using text prompts or even spatial controls. However, applying these editing methods to multi-view images depicting a single scene leads to 3D-inconsistent results. In this work, we focus on spatial control-based geometric manipulations and introduce a method to consolidate the editing process across various views. We build on two insights: (1) maintaining consistent features throughout the generative process helps...'
