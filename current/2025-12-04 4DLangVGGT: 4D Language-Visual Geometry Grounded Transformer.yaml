summary: The authors present a new Transformer-based framework, 4DLangVGGT, for constructing 4D language fields, which is crucial for applications like embodied AI and augmented reality. Unlike previous methods, 4DLangVGGT can be trained across multiple scenes and applied directly during inference, resulting in better generalization and efficiency, as demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets....
