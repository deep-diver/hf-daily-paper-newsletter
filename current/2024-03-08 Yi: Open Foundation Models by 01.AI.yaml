summary: This paper introduces the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The models are based on large pretrained language models and are extended to chat models, long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. The models achieve strong performance on various benchmarks and are attributed to the high quality of the data used for pretraining and finetuning....
