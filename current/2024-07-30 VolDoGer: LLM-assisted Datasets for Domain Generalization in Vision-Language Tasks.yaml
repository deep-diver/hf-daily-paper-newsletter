summary: The paper introduces VolDoGer, a dataset for vision-language tasks that helps deep learning models perform well on unseen data. This dataset is created using a new method that makes it easier and faster to create datasets for deep learning models. The paper also tests different models on this dataset to see how well they perform on unseen data....
