summary: We developed a tool called CrossViewDiff to create realistic street view images from satellite images. This tool helps overcome challenges by using satellite scene structure estimation and cross-view texture mapping modules to generate more realistic structures and textures. We also used a GPT-based scoring method to evaluate the results. Our tool performs better than other tools and will be available online....
