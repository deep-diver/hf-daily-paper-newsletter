summary: This paper proposes a new method called L-Mul that approximates floating point number multiplication with integer addition operations, which can significantly reduce the energy cost and computation resource of large neural networks. The method achieves higher precision than 8-bit floating point multiplications and can be applied to a variety of tasks such as natural language understanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question answering without losing much precision....
