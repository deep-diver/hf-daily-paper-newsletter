summary: The paper proposes a new research area called Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS) which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs. The paper also presents a simple algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, and through experiments, it shows that the algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents....
