summary: Kiss3DGen is a simple and efficient framework for 3D object generation by repurposing a trained 2D image diffusion model. It generates a tiled representation of multi-view images and normal maps, which are then used to reconstruct a 3D mesh and provide texture mapping for a complete 3D model....
