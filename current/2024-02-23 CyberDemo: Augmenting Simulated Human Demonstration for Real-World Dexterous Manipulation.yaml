summary: This paper presents CyberDemo, a method for robotic imitation learning that uses simulated human demonstrations for real-world tasks. By augmenting the data in a simulated environment, CyberDemo outperforms traditional real-world demonstrations and can handle diverse physical and visual conditions. It also exhibits generalizability with previously unseen objects, such as rotating novel tetra-valve and penta-valve, despite only being trained on tri-valves....
