summary: This paper presents CyberDemo, a method for robotic imitation learning that
  uses simulated human demonstrations for real-world tasks. By augmenting the data
  in a simulated environment, CyberDemo outperforms traditional real-world demonstrations
  and can handle diverse physical and visual conditions. It also exhibits generalizability
  with previously unseen objects, such as rotating novel tetra-valve and penta-valve,
  despite only being trained on tri-valves....
