summary: The authors present MLLMSeg, a new framework that makes full use of the visual detail features in MLLM vision encoder to improve the Referring Expression Segmentation task, without adding extra visual encoders. They also introduce a light-weight mask decoder that combines detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to predict precise masks, outperforming both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors in a cost-effective manner....
