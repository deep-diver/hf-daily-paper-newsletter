summary: The study presents DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, two first-generation reasoning models, where DeepSeek-R1-Zero is trained using reinforcement learning and exhibits impressive reasoning capabilities. However, it struggles with issues like poor readability and language mixing. To overcome these challenges and improve reasoning performance, DeepSeek-R1 is introduced with multi-stage training and cold-start data, achieving results comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks.
