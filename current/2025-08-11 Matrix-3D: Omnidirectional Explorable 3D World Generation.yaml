summary: The authors present a new method called Matrix-3D that creates large, explorable 3D worlds from a single image or text prompt using panoramic video generation and reconstruction. They trained a model to generate high-quality, geometrically consistent scene videos using scene mesh renders as a condition and proposed two methods to convert these panorama videos into 3D worlds, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation....
