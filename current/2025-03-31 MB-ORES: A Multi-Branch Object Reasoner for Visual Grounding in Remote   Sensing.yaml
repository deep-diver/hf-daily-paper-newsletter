summary: The authors present a new framework that combines object detection and visual grounding for remote sensing images. This framework, called MB-ORES, uses a multi-branch network to integrate spatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, followed by an object reasoning network to select the final referring object localization, outperforming existing methods on two benchmark datasets....
