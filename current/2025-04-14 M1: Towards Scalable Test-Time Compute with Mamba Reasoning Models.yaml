summary: The paper presents a new reasoning model, M1, based on the Mamba architecture, which is a hybrid linear RNN. M1 allows for memory-efficient inference and outperforms previous linear RNN models while matching the performance of state-of-the-art DeepSeek R1 distilled reasoning models at a similar scale, and achieves higher accuracy under a fixed generation time budget compared to DeepSeek R1 distilled transformer reasoning models....
