summary: This paper presents video-SALMONN, an audio-visual large language model that can understand visual frames, audio events, music, and speech. It uses a multi-resolution causal Q-Former structure to connect pre-trained audio-visual encoders and the large language model. Additionally, it proposes dedicated training approaches to avoid frames or modality dominance. Video-SALMONN demonstrates remarkable video comprehension and reasoning abilities and is available on GitHub....
