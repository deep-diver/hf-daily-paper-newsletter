summary: The researchers found an issue in the Outcome-Supervised Reinforcement Learning method used for training large language models, where positive-advantage tokens were not weighted correctly, leading to unbalanced updates. They proposed a new method called Asymmetric Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO) that fixes this issue by flipping the importance sampling ratios of positive-advantage tokens and using a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize updates. ASPO significantly improves tra...
