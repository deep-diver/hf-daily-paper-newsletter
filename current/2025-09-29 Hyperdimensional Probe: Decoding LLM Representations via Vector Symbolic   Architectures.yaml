summary: The research presents a new method called Hyperdimensional Probe that improves the understanding of Large Language Models' internal representations by combining symbolic representations and neural probing. This technique effectively extracts meaningful concepts from various LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, and helps identify LLM failures, enhancing the interpretability of these models....
