summary: This study explores a biologically inspired learning technique based on Dale's law, which leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. The researchers propose a new multiplicative denoising score-matching formalism, resulting in a novel update scheme for generating images from a log-normal density, and demonstrate its generative capabilities on various datasets....
