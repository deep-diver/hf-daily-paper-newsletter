summary: The study presents SEED-Bench-R1, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models, and proposes GRPO-CARE, a reinforcement learning framework that enhances both the correctness and coherence of reasoning in these models. GRPO-CARE outperforms existing methods on the benchmark, demonstrating improved performance and consistency, and also shows strong transferability to other video understanding tasks....
