summary: This paper presents DITTO, a framework for controlling pre-trained text-to-music
  diffusion models at inference-time via optimizing initial noise latents. The method
  can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve
  a target output and can be used for a wide-range of applications such as inpainting,
  outpainting, looping, and intensity control. DITTO outperforms comparable approaches
  on controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, making it a valu...
