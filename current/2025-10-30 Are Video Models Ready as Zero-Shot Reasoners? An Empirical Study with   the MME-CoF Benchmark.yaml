summary: This study tests if advanced video models, specifically Veo-3, can be used for zero-shot reasoning in various visual scenarios. The researchers found that while these models perform well in short-term spatial tasks, they struggle with long-term causal reasoning and complex logic, suggesting they're not yet fully reliable for standalone reasoning but show potential as visual aids for dedicated reasoning models....
