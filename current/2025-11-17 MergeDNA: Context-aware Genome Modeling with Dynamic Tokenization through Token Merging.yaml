summary: This study presents a new method for modeling genomic sequences that addresses the challenge of varying information density by automatically merging adjacent bases into words and using a hierarchical architecture with latent transformers for context-aware pre-training. The proposed model, MergeDNA, outperforms existing methods on various DNA benchmarks and multi-omics tasks....
