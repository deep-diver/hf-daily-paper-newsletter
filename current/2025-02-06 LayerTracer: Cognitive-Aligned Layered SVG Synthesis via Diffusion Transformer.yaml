summary: LayerTracer, a new AI-based framework, creates cognitively-aligned layered SVGs by imitating human design workflows and using a conditional diffusion mechanism to generate multi-phase rasterized blueprints and then layer-wise vectorization for clean, editable SVGs. It outperforms existing methods in both quality and editability, aligning AI-generated vectors with professional design cognition....
