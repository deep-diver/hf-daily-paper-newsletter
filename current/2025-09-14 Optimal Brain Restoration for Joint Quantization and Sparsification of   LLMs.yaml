summary: This study presents a new method called Optimal Brain Restoration (OBR) that combines quantization and sparsity for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). OBR addresses the conflicting requirements of these techniques by using a training-free framework that minimizes performance loss, resulting in faster and more memory-efficient LLMs....
