summary: This paper presents Loong, a new autoregressive language model-based video generator that can produce minute-long videos by addressing the challenges of generating long videos. The model is trained from scratch and employs progressive short-to-long training and loss re-weighting to mitigate imbalance issues. Inference strategies like video token re-encoding and sampling are also investigated to minimize error accumulation. Loong can generate minute-level videos conditioned on text prompts, as de...
