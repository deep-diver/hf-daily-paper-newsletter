summary: We propose Mimic Score, a data quality metric that uses a pretrained reference model to evaluate the usefulness of data samples for training a new model. Samples that misalign with this direction are considered low-value and can be filtered out. Empirically, using Mimic scores to guide model training results in consistent performance gains across six image datasets and enhances the performance of CLIP models....
