summary: The paper presents a method for understanding long videos using Large Language Models (LLMs) and addressing the challenge of context length constraints. It introduces a dynamic video encoding approach called 'Temporal Dynamic Context' (TDC), which segments the video into scenes and uses a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. This method then feeds the static frame tokens and temporal context tokens to the LLM for video understanding, even for extr...
