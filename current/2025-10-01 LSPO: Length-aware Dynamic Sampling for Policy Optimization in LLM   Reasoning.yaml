summary: This research presents LSPO, a new method for optimizing policy training in large language models (LLMs) by dynamically selecting training data based on response length. The study shows that LSPO improves learning effectiveness and provides insights for future research by conducting an ablation study on incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling....
