summary: 'The study presents Iceberg, a benchmark suite for evaluating Vector Similarity Search methods in real-world scenarios, focusing on three main sources of performance degradation: Embedding Loss, Metric Misuse, and Data Distribution Sensitivity. Iceberg assesses 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods across eight diverse datasets, revealing significant differences in their performance when evaluated based on application-level metrics rather than traditional recall-latency evaluations....'
