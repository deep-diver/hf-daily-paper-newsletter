summary: The study presents a new approach for reinforcement learning using large language models, explaining why and how a surrogate token-level objective can optimize the true sequence-level reward in policy gradient methods. They demonstrate the importance of minimizing training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness for this surrogate to work effectively, and provide guidelines for stable RL training through extensive experiments with a 30B model....
