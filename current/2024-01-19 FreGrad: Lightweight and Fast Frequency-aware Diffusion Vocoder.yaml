summary: FreGrad is a lightweight and fast diffusion-based vocoder that uses discrete wavelet transform, frequency-aware dilated convolution, and a bag of tricks to generate realistic audio. It is 3.7 times faster to train and 2.2 times faster to infer compared to the baseline, while reducing the model size by 0.6 times without sacrificing output quality.
