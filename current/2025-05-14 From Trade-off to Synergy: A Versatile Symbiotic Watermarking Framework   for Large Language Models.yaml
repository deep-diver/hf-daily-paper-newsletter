summary: 'The authors present a new watermarking framework for Large Language Models that combines logits-based and sampling-based schemes, improving upon existing methods by balancing detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. They propose three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid, with the hybrid framework adaptively embedding watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, and their approach is validated through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models, outperformi...'
