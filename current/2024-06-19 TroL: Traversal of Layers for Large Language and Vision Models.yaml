summary: We introduce a new family of efficient large language and vision models called TroL, which uses a layer traversing technique to simulate the effect of looking back and retracing the answering stream while increasing the number of forward propagation layers without physically adding more layers. This approach allows TroL to outperform open-source models with larger model sizes and rival the performances of closed-source models with substantial sizes, without requiring costly, high-end resources....
