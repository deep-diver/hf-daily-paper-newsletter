summary: The study presents SAFE, a new framework for ensembling Large Language Models in long-form generation, which selectively ensembles tokens by considering tokenization mismatch and consensus in probability distributions. SAFE also includes a probability sharpening strategy to improve stability, and experiments show that it outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency, even when ensembling very few tokens....
