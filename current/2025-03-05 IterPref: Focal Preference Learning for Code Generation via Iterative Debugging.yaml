summary: The proposed IterPref framework enhances preference alignment for code LLMs by mimicking human iterative debugging, providing more informative error correction patterns. It specifically identifies errors and aligns corresponding tokens using a tailored DPO algorithm, outperforming other methods in code generation tasks, including BigCodeBench....
