summary: This paper proposes a method called HSPI to identify the underlying hardware and software platforms of a machine learning model based on its input-output behavior. By analyzing numerical patterns in the model's outputs, HSPI can accurately identify the type of hardware and software configuration used for model inference. The method is evaluated against models served on different real hardware and achieves up to three times higher accuracy than random guessing in a black-box setting....
