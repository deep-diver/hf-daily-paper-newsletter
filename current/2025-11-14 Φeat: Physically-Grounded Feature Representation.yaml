summary: The study presents a new visual backbone called Φeat that focuses on physical factors like material identity, reflectance, and geometric structure for improved feature representation in vision tasks. By using a self-supervised training strategy, Φeat learns to create robust features that are invariant to external physical factors, demonstrating the potential of unsupervised physical feature learning for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics....
