summary: The researchers have created a large-scale dataset and model suite called CASS for translating GPU code between different architectures, specifically from Nvidia to AMD. This tool can translate both the source code and assembly language, and it performs much better than commercial translation tools. The researchers also made a benchmark to test the translations and released all their resources for others to use and improve upon....
