summary: This study presents two methods, Error-Constrained Layer Merging and Mask-guided Token Merging, to reduce computational cost in 3D Human Mesh Recovery transformer models by merging layers and tokens with minimal impact on accuracy. Additionally, a diffusion-based decoder is proposed to maintain performance, resulting in up to 2.3x speed-up and slight performance improvements over the baseline....
