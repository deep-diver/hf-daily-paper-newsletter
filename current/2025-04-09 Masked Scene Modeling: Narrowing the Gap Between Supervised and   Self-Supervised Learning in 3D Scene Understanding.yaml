summary: The paper proposes a self-supervised 3D scene understanding model, Masked Scene Modeling, that performs similarly to supervised models in a linear probing setup. This model is trained in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked Scene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in a bottom-up manner and is specifically designed for hierarchical 3D models....
