summary: This study explores how vision-language models handle cultural elements from different origins appearing together in images, introducing a new benchmark called CultureMix. The researchers find that current models struggle with this 'culture mixing' challenge, relying too much on backgrounds and providing inconsistent answers. They then propose and test strategies to improve model performance, finding that fine-tuning with a diverse dataset significantly enhances consistency and reduces backgroun...
