summary: 'The authors present a new method called MoCapAnything that can capture and recreate 3D motions for any type of digital character using just a single video. This is achieved through a framework that predicts joint movements and recovers specific rotations for each character, allowing for high-quality animations and cross-species retargeting. (ELI5: Imagine being able to take a video of someone moving and use it to make any digital character, like animals or robots, move in the same way. This pape...'
