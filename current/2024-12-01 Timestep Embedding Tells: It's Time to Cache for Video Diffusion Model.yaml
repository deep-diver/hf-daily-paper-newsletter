summary: TeaCache is a caching approach for video diffusion models that focuses on model inputs instead of outputs to improve inference efficiency. It uses timestep embeddings to estimate differences among model outputs and refine caching. Experiments show up to 4.41x acceleration with negligible degradation in visual quality....
