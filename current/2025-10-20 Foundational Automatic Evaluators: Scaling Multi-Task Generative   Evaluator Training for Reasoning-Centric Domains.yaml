summary: This study presents Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a new family of evaluators developed through data scaling using a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning approach. FARE-8B and FARE-20B outperform larger specialized evaluators and set new standards for open-source evaluators, demonstrating strong performance in real-world tasks such as inference-time reranking and verification in reinforcement learning training....
