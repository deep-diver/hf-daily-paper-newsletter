summary: The proposed ATLaS method improves LLM agents by focusing tuning on critical steps identified from expert trajectories, enhancing generalization and reducing overfitting risks. Through experiments, LLMs tuned on 30% of critical steps selected by ATLaS outperform those tuned on all steps and other open-source LLM agents....
