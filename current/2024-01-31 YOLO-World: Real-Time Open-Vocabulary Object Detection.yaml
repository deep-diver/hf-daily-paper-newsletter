summary: This paper introduces YOLO-World, a new method that allows the YOLO object detection system to recognize a wide range of objects in real-time, without needing to be trained on each specific object. This is done by combining visual and linguistic information using a new network architecture called RepVL-PAN. YOLO-World performs well on several tasks, including object detection, and is faster and more accurate than many state-of-the-art methods....
