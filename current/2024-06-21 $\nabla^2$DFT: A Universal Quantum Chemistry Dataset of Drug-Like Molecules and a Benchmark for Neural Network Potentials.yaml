summary: This paper introduces a new dataset and benchmark for training neural network potentials in quantum chemistry. The dataset, called nabla^2DFT, includes energies, forces, 17 molecular properties, Hamiltonian and overlap matrices, and a wavefunction object. The dataset is based on the nablaDFT and contains twice as much molecular structures, three times more conformations, new data types and tasks, and state-of-the-art models. The dataset includes calculations performed at the DFT level for each c...
