summary: This research explores using Reinforcement Learning to improve decoding-based regression, which converts regression into a sequence generation task using large language models. The proposed method aligns discrete token-level objectives with continuous numerical values, enhancing precision and generalization, and outperforms existing token-level baselines and traditional regression heads in various experiments....
