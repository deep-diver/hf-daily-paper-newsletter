summary: The proposed Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (EDGS) optimizes the rendering of dynamic scenes, addressing the drawbacks of traditional deformable Gaussian Splatting by using a sparse anchor-grid representation. This approach filters out anchors in static areas and calculates motion flow efficiently, leading to faster rendering speed and superior quality in real-world datasets....
