summary: This paper introduces new synthetic datasets to evaluate the temporal reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing research that relies on real-world data. The datasets cover various scenarios and enable a systematic investigation into factors affecting LLM performance. The findings provide valuable insights into LLM strengths and weaknesses, and the datasets and evaluation framework are open-sourced for further research....
