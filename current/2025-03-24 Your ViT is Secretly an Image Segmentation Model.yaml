summary: This research demonstrates that a larger Vision Transformer (ViT) model with extensive pre-training can perform image segmentation as well as existing methods, but faster due to its simpler architecture. The Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT) is proposed, which uses a plain ViT architecture for image segmentation, achieving similar accuracy to state-of-the-art models but with better prediction speed....
