summary: MARVEL-40M+ is a large dataset with detailed text annotations for 3D assets to improve computer vision for generating high-quality 3D content from text prompts. This dataset has a multi-stage annotation pipeline using AI models and human input to create descriptions for 3D assets. The two-stage text-to-3D pipeline, MARVEL-FX3D, uses AI models to create 3D meshes from text prompts quickly. MARVEL-40M+ is better than other datasets at creating detailed and diverse text annotations for 3D assets....
