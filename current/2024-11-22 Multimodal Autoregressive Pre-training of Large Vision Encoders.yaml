summary: This paper presents AIMV2, a family of generalist vision encoders that excel in various downstream tasks, including multimodal evaluations and vision benchmarks. The encoders are characterized by a straightforward pre-training process, scalability, and remarkable performance. AIMV2-3B encoder achieves 89.5% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk and outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive models in multimodal image understanding across diverse settings....
