summary: This study presents a new method to control the reasoning modes of large language models, which can either generalize well or memorize data verbatim. The proposed framework, Dynamic Mode Steering, uses a lightweight algorithm to identify reliance on memorization and steers the model towards generalization, improving logical consistency and factual accuracy....
