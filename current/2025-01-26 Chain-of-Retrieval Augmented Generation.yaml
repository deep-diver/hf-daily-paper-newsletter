summary: The approach presented in this work is a method for training RAG models that progressively retrieves and reasons over relevant information before generating the final response, improving on existing methods which usually perform a single retrieval step before generation. The proposed method, CoRAG, dynamically reformulates the query based on the changing state, using rejection sampling to generate intermediate retrieval chains for training. At test time, decoding strategies are used to control t...
