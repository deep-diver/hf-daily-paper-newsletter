summary: This study proposes a new method called Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT) for improving large language models and reinforcement learning. RPT treats next-token prediction as a learning task, rewarding it for correctly guessing the next token in a context, which enhances language modeling accuracy and offers a solid foundation for further refinement, all while utilizing vast text data efficiently....
