summary: 'This study presents Voyager, a novel video diffusion framework that generates world-consistent 3D point-cloud sequences from a single image with user-defined camera path, without requiring 3D reconstruction pipelines. The method uses three key components: World-Consistent Video Diffusion, Long-Range World Exploration, and Scalable Data Engine, resulting in improved visual quality and geometric accuracy for various applications....'
