summary: The paper proposes a new method called RALL-E that improves the accuracy of text-to-speech synthesis by breaking down the task into simpler steps and using chain-of-thought prompting. RALL-E significantly reduces the word error rate compared to the previous method VALL-E and is better at synthesizing difficult sentences....
