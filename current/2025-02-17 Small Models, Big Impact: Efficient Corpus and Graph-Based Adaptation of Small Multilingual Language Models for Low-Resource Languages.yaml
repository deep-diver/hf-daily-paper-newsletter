summary: The study focuses on adapting smaller multilingual language models to low-resource languages using parameter-efficient adapter-based methods, such as Sequential Bottleneck, Invertible Bottleneck, and Low-Rank Adaptation. Using a small dataset, the researchers found that adapter-based methods outperform full fine-tuning and smaller models work better than large ones for low-resource languages....
