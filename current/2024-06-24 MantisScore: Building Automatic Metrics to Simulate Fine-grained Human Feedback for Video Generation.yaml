summary: This paper introduces MantisScore, a new automatic video quality assessment tool. MantisScore is trained on the first large-scale dataset containing human-provided multi-aspect scores over 37.6K synthesized videos. Experiments show that MantisScore has a higher correlation with human judges than other metrics, making it a great proxy for human raters to rate different video models and improve current video generation models....
