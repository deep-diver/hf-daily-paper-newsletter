summary: The paper presents TexDreamer, a model that can generate high-fidelity 3D
  human textures from either text or image in seconds using an efficient texture adaptation
  fine-tuning strategy and a novel feature translator module. The model is trained
  on the largest high-resolution 3D human texture dataset, ATLAS, which contains 50k
  high-fidelity textures with text descriptions....
