summary: The paper presents TexDreamer, a model that can generate high-fidelity 3D human textures from either text or image in seconds using an efficient texture adaptation fine-tuning strategy and a novel feature translator module. The model is trained on the largest high-resolution 3D human texture dataset, ATLAS, which contains 50k high-fidelity textures with text descriptions....
