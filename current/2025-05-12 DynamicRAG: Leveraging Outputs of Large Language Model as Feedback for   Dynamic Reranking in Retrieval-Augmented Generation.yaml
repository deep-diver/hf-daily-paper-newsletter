summary: The authors present a new framework called DynamicRAG that uses a large language model's feedback to dynamically adjust the order and number of retrieved documents for a given query, improving the performance of retrieval-augmented generation systems. They use reinforcement learning to optimize the reranker, resulting in state-of-the-art results across several datasets....
