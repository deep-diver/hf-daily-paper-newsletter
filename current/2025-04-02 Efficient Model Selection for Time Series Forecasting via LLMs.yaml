summary: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to efficiently select models for time series forecasting, eliminating the need for expensive performance matrices built by traditional meta-learning approaches. Experiments show that this method outperforms traditional techniques and heuristic baselines while reducing computational overhead....
