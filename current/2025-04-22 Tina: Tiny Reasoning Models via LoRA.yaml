summary: The researchers developed a family of tiny reasoning models, Tina, that achieve strong reasoning abilities at a low cost by using a minimalist approach with parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning and low-rank adaptation. Tina models are highly cost-efficient, achieving competitive or better reasoning performance than existing state-of-the-art models at a fraction of the computational and financial cost....
