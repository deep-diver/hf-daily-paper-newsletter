summary: The study presents SkillFactory, a method that enables models to learn cognitive skills through self-distillation during a supervised fine-tuning stage before reinforcement learning. SkillFactory uses samples from the model itself, rearranged to provide training data, and helps models generalize to harder tasks and use cognitive skills effectively, making them more robust to out-of-domain tasks compared to reinforcement learned base models....
