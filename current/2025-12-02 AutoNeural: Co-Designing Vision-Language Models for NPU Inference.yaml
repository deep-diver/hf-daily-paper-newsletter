summary: The authors present AutoNeural, a new Vision-Language Model architecture designed for efficient inference on Neural Processing Units (NPUs). By replacing traditional components with more efficient alternatives, such as MobileNetV5-style backbones and State-Space Model principles, AutoNeural significantly reduces quantization error and latency, while also improving decoding speed and context window, making it ideal for real-time applications on NPUs....
