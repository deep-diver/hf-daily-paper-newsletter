summary: This study explores the alignment of video and text representations, finding that it heavily depends on the richness of visual and text data, especially with advanced video encoders. The research also suggests a link between strong alignment and general-purpose video understanding, and provides a new way to test vision and language models by correlating temporal reasoning with cross-modal alignment....
