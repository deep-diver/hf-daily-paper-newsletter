summary: The study presents a method to improve the recall ability of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) without significantly increasing the training costs or model parameters. This is achieved by expanding the state size of pre-trained RNNs through a post-training process, which enhances their performance in tasks requiring accurate recall of long contexts, such as linear attention and state space models, without compromising other capabilities....
