summary: We developed a method to learn object dynamics from multi-view RGB videos by considering robot actions and their effects on scene dynamics. We used 3D Gaussian representation and Graph Neural Networks to train a particle-based dynamics model, which can predict object motions and enable action-conditioned video prediction. This method can be applied to model-based planning frameworks for object manipulation tasks....
