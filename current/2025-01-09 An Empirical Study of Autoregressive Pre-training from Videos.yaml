summary: The paper presents an empirical study of autoregressive pre-training from videos using a series of models called Toto. The models are trained to predict future visual tokens in a sequence and are pre-trained on a large dataset. The study explores various architectural, training, and inference design choices and evaluates the learned visual representations on various downstream tasks. The results show that autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks and that...
