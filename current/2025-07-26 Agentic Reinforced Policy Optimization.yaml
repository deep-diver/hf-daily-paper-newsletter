summary: The authors present a new algorithm called Agentic Reinforced Policy Optimization (ARPO) that improves large language models' (LLMs) performance in multi-turn tool interactions by balancing their long-term reasoning abilities and tool usage proficiency. ARPO's entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism promotes exploration in uncertain steps after tool usage, and it outperforms existing trajectory-level RL algorithms across various benchmarks, requiring only half the tool-use budget....
