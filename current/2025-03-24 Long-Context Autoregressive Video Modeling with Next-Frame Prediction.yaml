summary: This work proposes a strong baseline for video autoregressive modeling, FAR, which models temporal causal dependencies between continuous frames. It then introduces FlexRoPE, a test-time technique, and long short-term context modeling to tackle the challenges of long-context video modeling, improving performance in both short- and long-video generation....
