summary: The authors present a new framework called FuncBind that generates all-atom molecules for various targets using computer vision techniques and neural fields. This modality-agnostic approach allows FuncBind to create competitive small molecules, macrocyclic peptides, and antibody loops, and even designed new antibody binders in vitro, all while handling diverse atomic systems and variable counts....
