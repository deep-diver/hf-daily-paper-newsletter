summary: This paper investigates hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) and proposes a method to reduce them by modifying the model's internal representations. The method involves projecting image representations to the language vocabulary, spatially localizing real objects, and removing hallucinations by orthogonalizing image features. Targeted edits to the model's latent representations can reduce hallucinations by up to 25.7% while preserving performance....
