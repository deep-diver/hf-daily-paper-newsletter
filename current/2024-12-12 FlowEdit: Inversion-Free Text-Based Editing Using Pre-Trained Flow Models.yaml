summary: FlowEdit is a new way to edit images using text prompts with pre-trained models. It doesn't need to convert the image into a noise map first, which makes it easier to use and can get better results. It works with different model architectures and gives the best results with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. You can try it out and see examples on the project's website....
