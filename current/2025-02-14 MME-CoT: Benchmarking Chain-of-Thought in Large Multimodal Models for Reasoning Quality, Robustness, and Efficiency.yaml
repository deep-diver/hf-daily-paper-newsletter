summary: The paper presents MME-CoT, a benchmark for evaluating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), covering various domains. Through a thorough evaluation suite, it uncovers insights on CoT quality, robustness, and efficiency in state-of-the-art LMMs, including a superior CoT quality in models with reflection mechanism and potential overthinking behavior....
