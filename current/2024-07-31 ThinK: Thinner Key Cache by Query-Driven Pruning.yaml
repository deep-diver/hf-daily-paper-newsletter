summary: This paper proposes ThinK, a method to reduce memory costs in long-sequence scenarios by selectively pruning less significant channels in the KV cache, while maintaining or even improving model accuracy. It achieves a reduction in memory costs by over 20% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction methods, and has been successfully evaluated on LLaMA3 and Mistral models....
