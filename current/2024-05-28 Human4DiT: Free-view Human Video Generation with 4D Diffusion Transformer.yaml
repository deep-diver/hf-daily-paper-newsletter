summary: We developed a new method to create realistic human videos from a single image, using a 4D diffusion transformer and a cascaded architecture. Our model can handle complex motions and viewpoint changes, and we trained it on a multi-dimensional dataset. Our approach outperforms previous methods based on GAN or UNet-based diffusion models, and it has potential applications in virtual reality and animation....
