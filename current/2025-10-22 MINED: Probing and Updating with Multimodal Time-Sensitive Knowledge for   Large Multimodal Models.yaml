summary: This study presents MINED, a new benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models' understanding of time-sensitive knowledge across six dimensions and 11 tasks. The benchmark reveals that while some models perform well, many still struggle with time-sensitive knowledge, especially in areas like sports. The researchers also explore ways to update models with new information, finding that knowledge editing methods can be effective in certain scenarios....
