summary: This research introduces a method using small neural networks, named InfluenceNetwork, to estimate influence values in models, reducing costs by a maximum of 99%. The authors apply this method, called NN-CIFT, to the task of subset selection for instruction fine-tuning, demonstrating that it performs as well as existing methods while being faster....
