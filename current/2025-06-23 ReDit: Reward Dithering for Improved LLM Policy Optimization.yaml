summary: The study presents ReDit, a method that adds random noise to discrete rewards in LLM policy optimization to address gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. ReDit enables smoother gradient updates, accelerates convergence, and encourages model exploration, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to vanilla GRPO in various tasks....
