summary: This paper proposes ComboVerse, a 3D generation framework that creates high-quality assets with complex compositions by combining multiple models. The framework uses spatially-aware score distillation sampling to guide the positioning of objects and achieves better results than existing methods in generating compositional 3D assets....
