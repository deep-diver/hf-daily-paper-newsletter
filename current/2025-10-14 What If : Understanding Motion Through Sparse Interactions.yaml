summary: The Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) is a new framework that predicts local motion distribution based on sparse interactions, providing a more interpretable and multi-modal representation of scene motion compared to traditional methods. The FPT model excels in various tasks, including dense face motion generation and articulated object motion estimation, and its source code is publicly available....
