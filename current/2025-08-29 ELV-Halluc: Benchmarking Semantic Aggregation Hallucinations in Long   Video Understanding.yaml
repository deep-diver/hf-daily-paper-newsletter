summary: This study presents ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark for long-video hallucinations, to investigate a new type of hallucination called Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH). SAH occurs when models generate incorrect outputs with correct frame-level semantics, and it becomes more critical in long videos due to increased complexity. The researchers confirm the existence of SAH, show that it increases with semantic complexity, and suggest potential approaches to mitigate it, such as positional enc...
