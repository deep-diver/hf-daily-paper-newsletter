summary: The researchers present Lumina-DiMOO, a new open-source model that excels at creating and understanding various types of data, such as text and images, by using a unique method called fully discrete diffusion modeling. This approach enables Lumina-DiMOO to perform tasks like generating images from text, editing images, and more, all while being more efficient than previous methods and outperforming other open-source models in these areas....
