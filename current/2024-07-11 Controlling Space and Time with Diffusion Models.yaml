summary: The paper introduces 4DiM, a cascaded diffusion model for 4D novel view synthesis, which is conditioned on images of a general scene and a set of camera poses and timestamps. The model is trained on 3D, 4D, and video data, and uses a new architecture that enables joint training. It also proposes the calibration of SfM posed data using monocular metric depth estimators for metric scale camera control. The paper introduces new metrics for model evaluation and demonstrates state-of-the-art results ...
