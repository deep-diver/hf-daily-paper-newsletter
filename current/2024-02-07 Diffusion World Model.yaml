summary: This paper introduces a new model, Diffusion World Model (DWM), which can
  predict multiple future states and rewards at once, without needing to repeatedly
  ask for predictions. The model helps to estimate values in a type of learning called
  model-based value estimation, and it can also be used to create synthetic data for
  offline Q-learning. DWM performs well in long-term simulations, and outperforms
  other one-step prediction models by 44%....
