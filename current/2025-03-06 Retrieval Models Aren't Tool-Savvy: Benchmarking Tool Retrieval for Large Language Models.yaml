summary: This study presents ToolRet, a benchmark for tool retrieval for LLMs, comprising 7.6k tasks and 43k tools. It's found that even strong conventional IR models perform poorly, lowering the task pass rate of LLMs; a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances is provided to improve tool retrieval ability....
