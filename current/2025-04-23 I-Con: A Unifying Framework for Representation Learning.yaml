summary: The study presents a unifying framework, I-Con, that generalizes many modern loss functions in machine learning by showing they minimize an integrated KL divergence between supervisory and learned representations. This framework leads to the creation of new loss functions and improves unsupervised image classifiers on ImageNet-1K by 8% and provides debiasing methods for contrastive representation learners....
