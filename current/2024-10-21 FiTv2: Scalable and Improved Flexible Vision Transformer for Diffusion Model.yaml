summary: FiTv2 is a transformer architecture designed to generate images with unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios. It improves upon the original FiT by incorporating new designs and a meticulously adjusted network structure, resulting in faster convergence and better computational efficiency. Additionally, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and diverse resolution generation, and can be adapted for high-resolution generation using an efficient post-training ...
