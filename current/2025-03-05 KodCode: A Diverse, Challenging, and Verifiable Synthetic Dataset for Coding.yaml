summary: KodCode is a new, synthetic dataset created to help train large language models for coding. It stands out because it covers a wide range of difficulties and domains, and each example has a solution and test cases that have been independently verified. The dataset was created by first generating a variety of coding questions, then creating solutions and test cases, and finally rewriting the questions and generating responses based on a reasoning model. Experiments using this dataset show improved...
