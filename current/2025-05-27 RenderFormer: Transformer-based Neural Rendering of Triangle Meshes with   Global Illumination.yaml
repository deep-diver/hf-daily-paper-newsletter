summary: 'RenderFormer is a new rendering pipeline that uses a transformer architecture to render images from triangle-based scenes with global illumination effects, without needing per-scene training. It works in two stages: a view-independent stage that models light transport between triangles, and a view-dependent stage that converts a sequence of triangle tokens into pixel values, resulting in realistic images with minimal constraints....'
