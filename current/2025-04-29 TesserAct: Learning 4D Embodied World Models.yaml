summary: The authors propose a new method for learning detailed 4D models of the world, which can predict how 3D scenes change over time in response to an agent's actions, using RGB-DN videos. This approach improves upon traditional 2D models, enables the creation of accurate inverse dynamic models, and enhances policy learning for embodied agents....
