summary: 'This academic paper introduces Seeker, a multi-agent framework that uses large language models to improve exception handling in code. The framework addresses three key issues: Insensitive Detection of Fragile Code, Inaccurate Capture of Exception Block, and Distorted Handling Solution. Seeker uses agents to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability....'
