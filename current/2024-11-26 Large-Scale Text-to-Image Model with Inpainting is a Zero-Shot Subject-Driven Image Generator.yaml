summary: Researchers present Diptych Prompting, a zero-shot approach that uses large-scale text-to-image models to create images of new subjects within a desired context. This method improves subject alignment and detail by reinterpreting image generation as an inpainting task and enhancing attention weights between panels during inpainting. The approach outperforms zero-shot image prompting methods and can be used for subject-driven generation, stylized image generation, and subject-driven image editing...
