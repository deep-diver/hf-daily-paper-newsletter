summary: This study presents a new method called GenRecal that allows for the transfer of knowledge from large, complex vision-language models to smaller, more efficient ones, enabling their use in real-world scenarios even on devices with limited resources. GenRecal addresses the challenge of varying architectures and token types among vision-language models by aligning and adapting feature representations, resulting in improved performance on various benchmarks....
