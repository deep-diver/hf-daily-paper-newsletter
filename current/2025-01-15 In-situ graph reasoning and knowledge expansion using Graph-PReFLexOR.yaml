summary: The paper introduces Graph-PReFLexOR, a system that uses graph reasoning and symbolic abstraction to dynamically expand domain knowledge. It combines reinforcement learning and category theory to support hierarchical inference and adaptive learning. Demonstrations include hypothesis generation, materials design, and creative reasoning. Results show superior reasoning depth and adaptability, highlighting the potential for transparent, multidisciplinary AI-driven discovery....
