summary: This survey explores the development of text-to-video generation models, from early generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) to hybrid diffusion-transformer architectures. It discusses the challenges faced in creating coherent, high-quality videos from text prompts, and suggests future directions for research in this evolving field....
