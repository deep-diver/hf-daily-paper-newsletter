summary: This research proposes a new method called GVM-RAFT to improve the efficiency of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models. By dynamically allocating computational resources based on prompt acceptance rates and stochastic gradient norms, GVM-RAFT minimizes gradient variance, leading to faster convergence and better accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks compared to the traditional RAFT method....
