summary: This paper proposes a new method for optimizing text-to-image Diffusion Models by aligning them with human perception in the U-Net embedding space. This approach outperforms standard methods in terms of quality and computational cost, and is easily integrable with other optimization techniques. The training code and LoRA weights will be available at the provided link....
