summary: The study finds that reinforcement learning significantly enhances large language models' performance with only a small portion of parameters being updated, a phenomenon known as parameter update sparsity. This sparsity is observed across various algorithms and models, and finetuning the subnetwork alone yields similar results as full finetuning, suggesting that RL updates a small subset of parameters that span nearly the full subspaces the parameter matrices can represent....
