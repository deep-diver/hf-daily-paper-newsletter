summary: The study presents ReasonFlux-PRM, a new framework that evaluates the reasoning traces of large language models, focusing on trajectory-response type reasoning. ReasonFlux-PRM offers fine-grained reward assignment and supports various settings, including offline and online reward supervision. Experimental results show that it outperforms other PRMs and human-curated baselines in downstream benchmarks, providing consistent performance improvements....
