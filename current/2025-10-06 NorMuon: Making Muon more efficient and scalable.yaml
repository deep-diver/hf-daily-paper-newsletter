summary: This study presents NorMuon, an optimizer that combines orthogonalization and neuron-level adaptive learning rates to improve training efficiency and scalability in large language models. NorMuon balances parameter utilization and maintains Muon's conditioning benefits, outperforming both Adam and Muon in various model scales while keeping a similar memory footprint to Muon....
