summary: This paper introduces the OpenBezoar family of models, which are fine-tuned versions of the OpenLLaMA 3Bv2 model, using a combination of synthetic instruction fine-tuning data and cost-effective QLoRA-based supervised fine-tuning. The resulting checkpoint, 'OpenBezoar-HH-RLHF-DPO', demonstrates superior performance over many models at the 3B parameter scale....
