summary: The authors of this study present a new method, D^3QE, to detect images generated by autoregressive models, which are different from previous methods as they generate images through discrete token prediction. The proposed method leverages the unique patterns and frequency distribution bias of the codebook in real and fake images, and it has shown superior detection accuracy and robustness to real-world perturbations across different autoregressive models....
