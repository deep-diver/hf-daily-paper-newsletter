summary: The paper presents IGPG, an autoregressive framework for generating neural network parameters, which is flexible and scalable, and can handle diverse tasks and architectures. IGPG uses a VQ-VAE and an autoregressive model to generate weight tokens, ensuring inter-layer coherence, and achieves competitive or superior performance, especially in handling large architectures....
