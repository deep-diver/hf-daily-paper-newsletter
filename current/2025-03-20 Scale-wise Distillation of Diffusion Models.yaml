summary: The paper introduces SwD, a method that uses the concept of predicting the next scale to improve the performance of diffusion models, which generate data at lower resolutions and then upscale the samples. SwD integrates this idea into existing diffusion distillation methods and introduces a new loss function for better similarity to the target distribution. When applied to text-to-image models, SwD reduces inference time and outperforms other methods with the same computation budget....
