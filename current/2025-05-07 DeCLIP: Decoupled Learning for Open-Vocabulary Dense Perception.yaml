summary: The researchers found that CLIP's image tokens have trouble combining information from related areas, leading to less accurate local predictions. They introduced DeCLIP, a new method that improves CLIP's performance by separating and enhancing 'content' and 'context' features, which significantly boosts accuracy in tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation....
