summary: The research proposes a new framework, VTP, to improve the quality of visual tokenizers for image generation by focusing on high-level semantics instead of pixel-level accuracy. Through extensive experimentation, the study finds that better understanding leads to better generation and that the proposed method scales more effectively with compute, parameters, and data, resulting in faster convergence and improved performance in downstream image generation tasks....
