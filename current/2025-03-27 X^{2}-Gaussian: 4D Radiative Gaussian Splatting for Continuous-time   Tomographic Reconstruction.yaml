summary: The proposed framework, X^2-Gaussian, addresses the limitations of conventional 4D CT reconstruction methods by providing a continuous-time approach that eliminates phase discretization and the need for external gating devices. It uses a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder architecture to predict time-varying Gaussian deformations, along with a physiology-driven periodic consistency loss to learn patient-specific breathing cycles directly from projections....
