summary: The authors describe a system called PSI that learns flexible world models from data through a three-step process. This system can predict probabilistic graphs, extract low-dimensional properties, and integrate these structures back into the model, enhancing its capabilities and creating new control handles for tasks like video prediction and understanding....
