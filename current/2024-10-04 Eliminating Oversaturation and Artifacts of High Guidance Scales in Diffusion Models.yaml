summary: This paper introduces adaptive projected guidance (APG), a method to improve the quality and realism of images generated by diffusion models without causing oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. APG achieves this by down-weighting a specific component of the classifier-free guidance (CFG) update rule and introducing a new rescaling and momentum method. APG is easy to implement and has no significant additional computational overhead. It is compatible with various conditional diffusion models...
