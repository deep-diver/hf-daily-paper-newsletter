summary: In this paper, we explore whether data scaling laws in robotics, specifically for robotic manipulation, can lead to single-task robot policies that can be deployed without any prior training in new environments with unseen objects. Our research involves collecting over 40,000 demonstrations and executing more than 15,000 real-world robot rollouts. We find that the generalization performance of the policy follows a power-law relationship with the number of environments and objects, and the divers...
