summary: This study addresses the limitation of prompt optimization approaches being confined to text, which hinders the full potential of multimodal language models (MLLMs). The researchers propose a unified framework called Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) that jointly optimizes multimodal prompts and guides prompt selection, outperforming text-only optimization methods across various modalities like images, videos, and molecules....
