summary: 'A study was done to see if advanced language models (LLMs) could solve a specific mathematical problem: determining whether a given multivariate polynomial is nonnegative. When given clear instructions, these models were able to solve the problem much more accurately than without instructions, and a smaller model with less computation time was still able to outperform larger models....'
