summary: This study presents a method called Bridge to create connected responses in parallel, which enhances the quality and consistency of the answers compared to independent generation. By using a small number of new parameters, Bridge improves accuracy and is compatible with any post-generation aggregation technique, offering a more efficient way to scale parallel processing....
