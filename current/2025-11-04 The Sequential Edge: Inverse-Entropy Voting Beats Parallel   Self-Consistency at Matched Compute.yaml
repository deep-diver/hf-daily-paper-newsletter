summary: 'This study compares two methods for language model reasoning: parallel self-consistency and sequential scaling. The researchers found that sequential scaling, which builds upon previous attempts, outperforms parallel self-consistency in 95.6% of configurations, with up to 46.7% higher accuracy. They also introduced a new method called inverse-entropy weighted voting, which further improves sequential scaling''s accuracy by weighing answers based on the inverse entropy of their reasoning chains....'
