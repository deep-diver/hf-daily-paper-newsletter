summary: This paper proposes STT, a tracking model for autonomous driving that accurately tracks and estimates the states of objects in three-dimensional space. STT uses rich appearance, geometry, and motion signals and is jointly optimized for data association and state estimation tasks. The paper also introduces new metrics called S-MOTA and MOTPS to evaluate the model's performance in the wider spectrum of object states....
