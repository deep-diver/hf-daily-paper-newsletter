summary: This study presents Text2World, a new benchmark for evaluating large language models' ability to generate symbolic world models from textual descriptions. Text2World is based on PDDL, featuring hundreds of domains and using multi-criteria, execution-based metrics, and it finds that reasoning models trained with large-scale reinforcement learning perform best, but still have limited capabilities, suggesting strategies like test-time scaling, agent training, and more to improve the world modeling ...
