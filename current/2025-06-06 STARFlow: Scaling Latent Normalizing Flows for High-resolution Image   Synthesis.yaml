summary: The authors propose STARFlow, a scalable generative model for high-resolution image synthesis, which uses a combination of normalizing flows and Autoregressive Transformers. They improve scalability through innovative architectural and algorithmic changes, resulting in competitive image generation performance, both class-conditional and text-conditional, approaching the quality of state-of-the-art diffusion models....
