summary: The SpineMed ecosystem, co-developed with spine surgeons, presents a large-scale dataset and evaluation framework for improving AI-assisted diagnosis of spine disorders. The dataset, SpineMed-450k, is designed for vertebral-level reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI, while SpineBench assesses models on clinically important factors. Advanced vision-language models show weaknesses in this fine-grained reasoning, but a model trained on SpineMed-450k significantly outperforms them, according to clini...
