summary: 'Merging multiple expert Large Language Models (LLMs) into one versatile model can sometimes result in misaligned models. The paper proposes a simple two-step approach to address this problem: generating synthetic safety and domain-specific data, and incorporating these generated data into the optimization process of existing data-aware model merging techniques. This allows us to maximize alignment in the resulting merged LLM....'
