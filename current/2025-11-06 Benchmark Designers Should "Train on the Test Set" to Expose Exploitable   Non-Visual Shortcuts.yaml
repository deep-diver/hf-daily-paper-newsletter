summary: The study presents a method for creating robust benchmarks for multimodal large language models by identifying and mitigating non-visual biases. The approach involves a 'Test-set Stress-Test' to diagnose benchmark susceptibility and an 'Iterative Bias Pruning' procedure to filter high-bias samples, which is applied to four benchmarks, resulting in a new, less biased benchmark called VSI-Bench-Debiased....
