summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method that can transfer high-detailed textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across different categories. This method takes inspiration from recent advancements in diffusion models and significantly improves texture quality. Experiments show that TextureDreamer produces highly realistic, semantically meaningful textures, surpassing the visual quality of previous state-of-the-art methods....
