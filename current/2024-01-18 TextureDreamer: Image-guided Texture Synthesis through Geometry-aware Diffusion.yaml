summary: TextureDreamer is a novel image-guided texture synthesis method to transfer relightable textures from a small number of input images to target 3D shapes across arbitrary categories. It uses personalized geometry-aware score distillation (PGSD), drawing inspiration from recent advancements in diffuse models to improve texture quality, and shows superior visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art methods....
