summary: The authors propose a new method called Delta Activations to represent fine-tuned large language models as vector embeddings, making it easier to organize and understand these models based on their tasks and domains. This approach has desirable properties, such as being robust and additive, and can also be used for model selection and merging, ultimately helping to improve the reuse of publicly available models....
