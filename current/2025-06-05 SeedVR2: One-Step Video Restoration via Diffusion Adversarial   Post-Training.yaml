summary: The study presents SeedVR2, a one-step model for improving video restoration quality, which uses adversarial training against real data. The model features an adaptive window attention mechanism that adjusts dynamically to output resolutions, and a series of losses to enhance training stability and efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive experiments....
