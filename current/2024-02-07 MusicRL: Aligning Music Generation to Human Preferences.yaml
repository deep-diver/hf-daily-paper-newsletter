summary: The paper proposes MusicRL, a text-to-music model that incorporates human
  feedback using reinforcement learning to improve the system's performance. The model
  is evaluated through human evaluations and is shown to be a better alternative than
  the baseline model. The study highlights the importance of subjective preferences
  in music appreciation and calls for more involvement of human listeners in the finetuning
  of music generation models....
