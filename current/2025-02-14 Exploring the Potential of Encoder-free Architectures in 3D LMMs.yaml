summary: The abstract discusses the investigation of encoder-free architectures for 3D Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), addressing challenges like varying point cloud resolutions and semantic needs. The study introduces a strategy for the pre-training stage, the LLM-embedded Semantic Encoding, and the Hierarchical Geometry Aggregation for the instruction tuning stage, resulting in the ENEL model that rivals the current state-of-the-art model....
