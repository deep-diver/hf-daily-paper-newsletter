summary: The paper presents CARFF, a method for predicting future 3D scenes based on past observations using a probabilistic encoder and a global Neural Radiance Field. It extends previous work by considering complex scenarios of uncertainty and is trained using a two-stage process. It is demonstrated to be useful for autonomous driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator....
