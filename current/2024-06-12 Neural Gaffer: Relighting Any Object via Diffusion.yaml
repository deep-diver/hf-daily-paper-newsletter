summary: Neural Gaffer is a new method that can create realistic, high-quality images of objects under different lighting conditions, without needing to know the object's shape, material, or lighting details. It uses a pre-trained model to learn about lighting and fine-tunes it on a synthetic dataset, and it can be used for various tasks like text-based relighting and object insertion....
