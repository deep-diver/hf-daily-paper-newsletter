summary: This study presents a new method called GeoDistill that enhances cross-view localization, which involves estimating a camera's position using ground-level and satellite images. By using a teacher-student learning approach with specific masking techniques, GeoDistill focuses on essential features like lane lines and ignores unimportant areas, leading to more accurate predictions and improved performance in real-world scenarios....
