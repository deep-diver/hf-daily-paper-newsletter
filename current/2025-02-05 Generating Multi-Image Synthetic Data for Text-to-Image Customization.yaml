summary: The paper presents a method to improve text-to-image models by creating a high-quality synthetic dataset with multiple images of the same object, instead of relying on costly test-time optimization or single-image training datasets. It also introduces a new encoder architecture based on shared attention mechanisms and a new inference technique to better capture fine-grained visual details and mitigate overexposure issues....
