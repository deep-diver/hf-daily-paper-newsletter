summary: The research presents a new method for optimizing the use of computation in large language models during inference, focusing on finding the best combination of models and their arrangements for specific tasks. The proposed solution, Agent-REINFORCE, is an LLM-agent-augmented framework that improves upon traditional methods by being more efficient and effective in identifying optimal model configurations, as demonstrated through experiments....
