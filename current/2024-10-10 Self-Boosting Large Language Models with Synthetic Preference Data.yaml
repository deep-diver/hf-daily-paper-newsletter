summary: SynPO is a new method that helps large language models get better at following instructions and performing tasks by using synthetic preference data. This method involves an iterative process where a self-prompt generator creates diverse prompts and a response improver refines model responses. After four iterations, the models show significant improvements in instruction-following abilities and general performance on various tasks....
