summary: We propose Video-Ma$^2$mba, a new architecture that uses State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-Axis Gradient Checkpointing (MA-GC) to efficiently process long video sequences. This allows LMMs to scale linearly in terms of time and memory requirements, making it feasible to handle long-duration video content. Our approach significantly reduces the memory footprint compared to standard gradient checkpointing, and empirical analyses show that Video-Ma$^2$mba can process extensive video sequences-equ...
