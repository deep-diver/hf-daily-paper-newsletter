summary: The authors present a new model called cadrille that uses visual, language, and procedural data for CAD reconstruction, which outperforms existing single-modal methods in a benchmark. They also demonstrate that using online reinforcement learning for fine-tuning the model leads to better results than offline methods, setting new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets....
