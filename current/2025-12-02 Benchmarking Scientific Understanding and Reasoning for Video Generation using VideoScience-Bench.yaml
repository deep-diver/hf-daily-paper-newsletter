summary: The researchers have created a new benchmark called VideoScience-Bench to test how well video models understand and apply scientific concepts like those taught in undergraduate physics and chemistry courses. They evaluated seven advanced video models using this benchmark and found that the models' performance was strongly correlated with human evaluations, making this the first benchmark to assess video models' ability to reason scientifically....
