summary: The researchers present SwiftVLA, an efficient architecture that enhances a compact model with 4D understanding. It uses a pretrained 4D visual geometry transformer and a temporal cache to extract 4D features from 2D images, along with Fusion Tokens and a mask-and-reconstruct strategy to improve the model's performance on real and simulated environments, outperforming lightweight baselines and rivaling larger VLAs....
