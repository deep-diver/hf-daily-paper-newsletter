summary: Puppet-Master is a video generative model that can create realistic part-level motion based on a single image and sparse motion trajectories. It uses a large-scale pre-trained video diffusion model and a new conditioning architecture to inject dragging control effectively. The model is trained on a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips and outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark....
