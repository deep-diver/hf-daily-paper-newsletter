summary: We propose Synthio, a method to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data by augmenting small-scale audio classification datasets with synthetic data generated from text-to-audio diffusion models. Synthio aligns the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization to ensure acoustic consistency and proposes a novel caption generation technique to generate diverse and meaningful audio captions. Synthio consistently outperforms all basel...
