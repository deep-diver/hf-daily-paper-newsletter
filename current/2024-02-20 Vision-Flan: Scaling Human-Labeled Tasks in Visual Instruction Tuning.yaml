summary: This paper proposes Vision-Flan, a diverse dataset of 187 tasks and 1.6 million instances for visual instruction tuning of vision-language models, and a two-stage tuning framework that outperforms traditional methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The findings suggest that GPT-4 synthesized data modulates model responses, a minimal quantity can align responses with human preference, and instruction tuning helps large-language models understand visual features....
