summary: This paper introduces a method to teach multiple large language models to collaborate by interleaving their generations at the token level. By optimizing the marginal likelihood of a training set under their latent variable model, the base LLM learns when to generate and when to call on an assistant language model to generate, all without direct supervision. This collaboration improves performance on various tasks....
