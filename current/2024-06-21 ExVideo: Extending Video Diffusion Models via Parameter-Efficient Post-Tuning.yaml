summary: We present ExVideo, a new method for enhancing video synthesis models to create longer videos with lower training costs. Our approach works by extending the temporal duration of existing models like Stable Video Diffusion, and we achieve this by modifying their architectures. We test our method on the Stable Video Diffusion model and find that it can generate videos up to 5 times longer with only 1.5k GPU hours of training. Our method does not compromise the model's ability to generalize and cre...
