summary: DynaGuide is a new method for steering diffusion policies using guidance from an external dynamics model during the denoising process. It has advantages like steering towards multiple objectives, enhancing underrepresented behaviors, and maintaining robustness on low-quality objectives, and it works with pretrained diffusion policies. DynaGuide outperforms goal-conditioning in experiments and can even create novel behavior in real robot policies....
