summary: The authors present a new framework called Discrete Markov Bridge for learning discrete representations, which overcomes the limitations of fixed rate transition matrices in existing methods. This framework, consisting of Matrix Learning and Score Learning components, provides performance guarantees, addresses space complexity, and outperforms baselines in empirical evaluations on Text8 and CIFAR-10 datasets....
