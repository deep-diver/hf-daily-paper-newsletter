summary: The authors present the JL1-CD dataset, a collection of 5,000 pairs of high-resolution remote sensing images, to tackle the scarcity of open-source CD datasets. They also propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework for improving the performance of CD models, achieving new state-of-the-art results on various network architectures and parameter sizes....
