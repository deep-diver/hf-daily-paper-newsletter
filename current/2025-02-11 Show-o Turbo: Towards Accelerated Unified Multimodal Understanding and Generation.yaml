summary: This research presents Show-o Turbo, a faster version of the Show-o model, which improves the efficiency of unified multimodal understanding and generation. Show-o Turbo achieves this by optimizing the denoising process and extending consistency distillation to multimodal denoising trajectories, resulting in a 1.5x speedup without significant loss in performance for both text-to-image and image-to-text generation....
