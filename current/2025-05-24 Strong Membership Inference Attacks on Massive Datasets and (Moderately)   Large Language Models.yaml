summary: 'The study scales a strong membership inference attack (LiRA) to large language models (GPT-2) and a massive dataset (C4) to understand the effectiveness of such attacks. The key findings are: (1) strong attacks can work on pre-trained language models, (2) their success is limited in real-world scenarios, and (3) the connection between attack success and privacy metrics is more complex than previously thought....'
