summary: This paper proposes a new method called 3D Congealing for aligning 2D images of similar objects in a 3D space, without relying on predefined shapes or camera settings. The method uses a combination of prior knowledge from an image generative model and semantic information from the input images to achieve accurate alignment, even in challenging conditions and with in-the-wild image collections. This method can be used for tasks such as correspondence matching, pose estimation, and image editing, ...
