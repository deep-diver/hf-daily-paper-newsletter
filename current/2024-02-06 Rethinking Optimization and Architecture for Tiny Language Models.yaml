summary: |-
    The paper presents a study on optimizing the training process of tiny language models by analyzing different components such as neural architecture, parameter initialization, and optimization strategy based on a 1B parameter language model. Experimental results show significant improvement in benchmark evaluation sets for the optimized models.
