summary: This paper presents a new method to speed up the inference process of diffusion models for image generation by simplifying the model architecture and reducing the number of sampling steps. The method, called SDXS, achieves a significant reduction in model latency and offers potential applications in image-conditioned control and image-to-image translation....
