summary: The authors present a new model called UniEgoMotion that can predict, generate, and reconstruct human motion from a first-person perspective, which is essential for improving AR/VR experiences and human-robot interaction. Unlike previous models, UniEgoMotion considers the scene context from first-person images to create realistic 3D motion, and it has achieved top performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and generating motion from a single egocentric image....
