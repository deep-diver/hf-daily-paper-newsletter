summary: This paper presents Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a new technique for continuous sequential prediction that outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models across six real-world sensor datasets, and has efficient scaling to smaller datasets and compatibility with data filtering techniques. The authors show that HiSS is effective in using long sequences of raw sensor data to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities....
