summary: This paper presents Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a new technique
  for continuous sequential prediction that outperforms state-of-the-art sequence
  models across six real-world sensor datasets, and has efficient scaling to smaller
  datasets and compatibility with data filtering techniques. The authors show that
  HiSS is effective in using long sequences of raw sensor data to predict sequences
  of desirable physical quantities....
