summary: The paper introduces a new method called Gaussian Splatting Transformers (GST) for creating realistic 3D human models from a single image. GST uses a transformer model to predict small adjustments to the positions of standardized human mesh vertices and other Gaussian attributes. The method can achieve fast inference of 3D human models without test-time optimization, expensive diffusion models, or 3D points supervision. The code is available on the project website....
