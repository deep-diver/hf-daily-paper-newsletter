summary: This paper proposes a system to endow Vision Language Models (VLMs) with spatial reasoning capabilities by training them with internet-scale spatial reasoning data generated by an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework. The authors aim to address the VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability by focusing on 3D spatial knowledge in training data and enhancing their ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA. By training a VLM on such data, the authors unlock novel applic...
