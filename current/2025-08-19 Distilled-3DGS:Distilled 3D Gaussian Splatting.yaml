summary: The researchers present a new method called Distilled-3DGS to improve 3D Gaussian Splatting for creating new images from 3D models. Their approach reduces memory usage and storage requirements by using multiple teacher models to guide a lightweight student model, resulting in better performance compared to existing methods....
