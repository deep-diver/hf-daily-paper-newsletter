summary: This paper introduces a new 3D generative model called Make-A-Shape that uses a wavelet-tree representation for efficient training on large scale, utilizing 10 million public shapes. The representation is made generatable by a diffusion model and can generate shapes from various modalities. The approach outperforms state-of-the-art in quality and generates shapes within seconds. The model is trained using a subband adaptive strategy, which enables it to learn to generate both coarse and detail w...
