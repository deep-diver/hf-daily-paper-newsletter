summary: This paper presents a new method called AutoIF for generating high-quality training data for large language models to improve their instruction-following abilities. AutoIF involves LLMs generating instructions, code to verify the instructions, and test samples to verify the code. This process is then used for training data generation and achieves significant improvements in three training algorithms when applied to popular LLMs....
