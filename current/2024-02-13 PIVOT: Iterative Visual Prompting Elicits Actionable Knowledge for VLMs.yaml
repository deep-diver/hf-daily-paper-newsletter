summary: This paper proposes a novel approach called PIVOT that enables Vision Language Models to handle spatial tasks such as robotic control and navigation without fine-tuning, by casting tasks as iterative visual question answering. PIVOT is investigated on various real-world and simulated spatial tasks, showing promising results such as zero-shot control of robotic systems without any training data....
