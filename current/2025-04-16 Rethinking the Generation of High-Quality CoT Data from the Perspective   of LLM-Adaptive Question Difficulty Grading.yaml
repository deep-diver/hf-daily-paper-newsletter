summary: The study creates an efficient method for generating high-quality reasoning data with varying difficulty levels tailored to different large language models (LLMs). This approach reduces data generation costs and improves model training efficiency, as demonstrated by the superior performance of ZMath-32B and ZCode-32B in mathematical and code reasoning tasks, respectively....
