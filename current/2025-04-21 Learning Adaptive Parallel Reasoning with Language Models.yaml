thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.15466
summary: The authors present Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (APR), a new method that allows language models to combine serial and parallel computations for reasoning. APR improves performance, scalability, and accuracy of language models in the Countdown reasoning task by optimizing inference threads and enabling adaptive multi-threaded inference....
