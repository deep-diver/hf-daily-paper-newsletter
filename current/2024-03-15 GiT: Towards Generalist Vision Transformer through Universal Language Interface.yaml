summary: This paper proposes a framework called GiT that uses a single Transformer architecture to perform various vision tasks without the need for specific additions or task-specific fine-tuning. GiT is trained on multiple datasets and achieves strong results in zero-shot learning, showing promise for narrowing the gap between vision and language models....
