summary: UniAff is a new way to help robots understand how to use tools and move in 3D spaces. It uses special computers to learn about objects and tasks to make robots better at manipulating things. The researchers made a big dataset with labeled information about tools and objects, and they tested UniAff in both simulations and the real world. They hope UniAff will be a starting point for future robot manipulation studies....
