summary: This paper presents a method to improve mathematical reasoning in non-English languages by combining different language models. The method replaces layers of a math model with layers from a language model, enhancing math performance in the target language. The merged models outperform individual models and other merging methods on a math benchmark, and the process is simple, inexpensive, and based on an analysis of parameter changes during fine-tuning....
