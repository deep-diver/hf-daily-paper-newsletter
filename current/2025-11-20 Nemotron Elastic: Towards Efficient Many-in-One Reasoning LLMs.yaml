summary: The authors present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for creating reasoning-oriented LLMs with multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. This approach significantly reduces training costs compared to training model families from scratch or using state-of-the-art compression techniques, while maintaining or improving accuracy....
