summary: GRIN (GRadient-INformed MoE training) is a method that improves the performance of Mixture-of-Experts models by incorporating sparse gradient estimation and configuring model parallelism. This results in a more effective scaling of MoE models, as demonstrated by a top-2 16times3.8B MoE model that outperforms a 7B dense model and matches the performance of a 14B dense model, while only using 6.6B activated parameters. GRIN also shows promise in enhancing MoE efficacy across diverse tasks, achievi...
