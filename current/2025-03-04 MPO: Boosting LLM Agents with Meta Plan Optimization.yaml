summary: The proposed Meta Plan Optimization (MPO) framework enhances LLM-based agents' planning capabilities by incorporating explicit guidance through high-level general guidance called meta plans, enabling continuous optimization based on agent feedback. MPO outperforms existing methods in experiments conducted on two representative tasks, improving task completion efficiency and generalization in unseen scenarios....
