summary: This study focuses on the challenge of forgetting sensitive information in multimodal LLMs, which process both image and text data. They create a new benchmark and evaluation framework to measure the effectiveness of various methods in deleting specific multimodal knowledge from these models, revealing that multimodal attacks are more successful than text or image-only ones, and larger models are more robust against post-editing attacks....
