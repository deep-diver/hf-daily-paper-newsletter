summary: The authors present HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline that generates high-quality test cases for difficult coding problems using large language models (LLMs). This pipeline is used to create HARDTESTS, a dataset of 47,000 problems with synthetic tests, which significantly improves the precision and recall of existing tests when evaluating LLM-generated code, especially for harder problems....
