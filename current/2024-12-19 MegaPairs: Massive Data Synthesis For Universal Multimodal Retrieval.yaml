summary: This paper introduces MegaPairs, a method for creating large amounts of training data for multimodal retrieval. It uses vision language models and open-domain images to generate high-quality data, which allows a multimodal retriever to outperform a baseline model trained on 70 times more data from existing datasets. MegaPairs can be easily scaled up and has produced more than 26 million training instances. The paper also introduces several new models that achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot perfo...
