summary: This paper proposes PeriodWave-Turbo, a high-quality and efficient waveform generation model that improves upon existing models by reducing the number of steps required for generation and enhancing high-frequency information. It achieves this by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification and using reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback. The model significantly reduces inference speed and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various objective metrics, with a perceptual evaluati...
