summary: This paper proposes a framework called GALA3D that uses language models to generate the initial layout and then generates 3D content using a layout-guided 3D Gaussian representation. The framework also includes an object-scene compositional optimization mechanism to generate realistic 3D scenes with consistent geometry, texture, scale, and accurate interactions among multiple objects....
