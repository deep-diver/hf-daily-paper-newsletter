summary: The authors present VIR-Bench, a new benchmark for testing the geospatial and temporal understanding of video in multimodal large language models. This benchmark consists of 200 travel videos and evaluates models' performance in reconstructing itineraries, which is crucial for real-world tasks like AI planning and navigation. Experiments show that current MLLMs struggle with this task, and the authors develop a travel-planning agent that improves itinerary recommendations based on VIR-Bench insi...
