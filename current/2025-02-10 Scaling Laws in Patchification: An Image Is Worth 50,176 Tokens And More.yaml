summary: 'This study explores the impact of patchification-based image tokenization on visual understanding in plain architectures like ViT and Mamba. The researchers find an intriguing scaling law: decreasing patch sizes can consistently improve predictive performance until reaching pixel tokenization, and this conclusion applies to various tasks, input scales, and architectures. They also discover that smaller patches make task-specific decoder heads less critical for dense prediction, and they successf...'
