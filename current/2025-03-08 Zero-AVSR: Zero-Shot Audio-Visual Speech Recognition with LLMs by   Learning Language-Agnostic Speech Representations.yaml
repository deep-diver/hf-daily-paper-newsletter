summary: The proposed Zero-AVSR framework utilizes a novel Audio-Visual Speech Romanizer (AV-Romanizer) to learn language-agnostic speech representations, enabling zero-shot AVSR. It then leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert predicted Roman text into language-specific graphemes, forming the Cascaded Zero-AVSR. Alternatively, it integrates audio-visual speech representations into the LLM through a unified approach, fine-tuning the adapter and LLM using a multi-task learning scheme. The Multil...
