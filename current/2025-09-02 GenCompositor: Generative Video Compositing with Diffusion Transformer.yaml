summary: The authors propose a new method for automating video compositing using generative models, which allows for interactive customization of foreground elements in videos. They introduce a novel Diffusion Transformer pipeline, a lightweight background preservation branch, and a DiT fusion block to maintain consistency and fuse background and foreground videos with different layouts. The proposed method was trained and tested on a curated dataset of 61K video sets, demonstrating improved fidelity and...
