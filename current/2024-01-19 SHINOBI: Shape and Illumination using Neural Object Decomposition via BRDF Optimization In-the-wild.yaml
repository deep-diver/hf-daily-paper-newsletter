summary: The paper SHINOBI presents an end-to-end framework for the reconstruction of shape, material, and illumination from object images captured with varying lighting, pose, and background. The framework uses an implicit shape representation based on a multi-resolution hash encoding and jointly optimizes BRDF and illumination with the object's shape to enable editing of illumination and object reflectance. The method is class-agnostic and works on in-the-wild image collections to produce relightable 3...
