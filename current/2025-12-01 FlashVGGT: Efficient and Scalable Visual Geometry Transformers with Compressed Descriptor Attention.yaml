summary: The study presents FlashVGGT, a more efficient version of the Visual Geometry Grounding Transformer, which solves the scalability issue of its predecessor by using a descriptor-based attention mechanism. This method significantly reduces computational costs and enables online inference over long sequences, resulting in faster inference time and better scalability without compromising reconstruction accuracy....
