summary: The study introduces a new method called Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE) to process visual tokens in a more efficient way. By using a nested structure for experts, MoNE can dynamically choose tokens in a priority order and reduce inference time compute by over two-fold. The approach is validated on standard image and video datasets and demonstrates strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets using only a single trained model....
