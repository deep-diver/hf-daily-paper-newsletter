summary: This study presents SHINE, a new framework for creating high-quality, realistic images by inserting objects into scenes without the need for complex training. SHINE uses pre-existing models and techniques to ensure the inserted objects maintain their accuracy and blend seamlessly with the background, while also addressing issues like poor lighting and reflections. The researchers also introduce a new benchmark, ComplexCompo, to evaluate and compare the performance of different image composition ...
