summary: This paper introduces DeepSpeed-FastGen, a high-throughput text generation system for LLMs using Dynamic SplitFuse, a novel prompt and generation composition strategy. It leverages DeepSpeed-MII and DeepSpeed-Inference to provide an efficient serving system for LLMs with non-persistent and persistent deployment options. This system delivers up to 2.3x higher throughput, 2x lower latency, and up to 3.7x lower tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. It offers a detailed benchmarking met...
