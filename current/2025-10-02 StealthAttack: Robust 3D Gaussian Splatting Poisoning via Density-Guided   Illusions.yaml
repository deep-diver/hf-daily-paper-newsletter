summary: This research studies the weaknesses of 3D scene representation methods, specifically 3D Gaussian Splatting, and proposes a new strategy to exploit these vulnerabilities. The method involves inserting illusory objects into scenes from specific viewpoints without significantly affecting other views, and it also disrupts the consistency of multiple views to enhance the attack's effectiveness....
