summary: This study presents a new method, Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL), to improve the reasoning ability of Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs). By using thought templates derived from previous problem-solving traces, the approach structures how evidence is combined and guides multi-hop inference, resulting in consistent improvements across various benchmarks and LCLM families, and even enabling distillation into smaller open-source models for broader applicability....
