title: 'FastKV: KV Cache Compression for Fast Long-Context Processing with Token-Selective Propagation'
thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.01068
summary: FastKV is a KV cache compression method that improves latency for long-context sequences in large language models (LLMs). It does this by using a novel Token-Selective Propagation approach and grouped-query attention-aware KV cache compression to boost processing speeds while preserving accuracy....
