summary: This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework called RAGElo to evaluate the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the context of a product QA task at Infineon Technologies. RAGElo leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate large datasets of synthetic queries, uses LLM-as-a-judge to rate retrieved documents and answers, and ranks different variants of RAG agents based on an automated Elo-based competition. The framework shows a moderate, positive correl...
