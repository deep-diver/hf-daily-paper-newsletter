summary: This study examines how reducing precision affects the performance of YOLO object detection models in recognizing objects under various real-world image distortions. The researchers propose a new method to improve model robustness under distortions, which works better for larger models and specific distortions but doesn't consistently improve performance across all models and distortions....
