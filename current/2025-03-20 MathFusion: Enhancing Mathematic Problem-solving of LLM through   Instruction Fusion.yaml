summary: 'MathFusion is a framework that enhances mathematical reasoning in LLMs by creating new problems through three fusion strategies: sequential, parallel, and conditional. It generates a new dataset MathFusionQA for fine-tuning models, resulting in a 18.0 point accuracy improvement across diverse benchmarks with minimal additional synthetic instructions....'
