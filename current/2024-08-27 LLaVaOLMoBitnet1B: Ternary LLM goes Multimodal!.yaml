summary: Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have seen significant advancements in the last year, demonstrating impressive performance across tasks. However, to truly democratize AI, models must exhibit strong capabilities and be able to run efficiently on small compute footprints accessible by most. Part of this quest, we introduce LLaVaOLMoBitnet1B - the first Ternary Multimodal LLM capable of accepting Image(s)+Text inputs to produce coherent textual responses. The model is fully open-sourced a...
