summary: SuperCorrect is a two-stage framework that uses a large teacher model to supervise and correct the reasoning and reflection processes of a smaller student model. It helps the student model to identify and correct reasoning errors, and to learn from the teacher model's error-driven insights. This approach improves the student model's performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks, and achieves new SOTA performance among all 7B models....
