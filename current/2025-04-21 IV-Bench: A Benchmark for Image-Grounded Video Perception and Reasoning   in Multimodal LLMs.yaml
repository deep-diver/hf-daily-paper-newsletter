summary: The study presents IV-Bench, a new benchmark for testing how well multimodal large language models understand videos based on images. They find that these models struggle with this task, often getting it wrong, even when the videos and images are simple. The researchers also identify factors that affect the models' performance and show that making the data format match the training process isn't enough to improve results....
