summary: The paper presents EVA-CLIP-18B, the largest and most powerful open-source CLIP model with 18-billion parameters. With a smaller training dataset, it achieves a higher zero-shot top-1 accuracy compared to its predecessor and other open-source CLIP models, demonstrating the potential of EVA-style weak-to-strong visual model scaling....
