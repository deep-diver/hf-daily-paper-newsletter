summary: This study compares the cognitive patterns of large language models (LLMs) to those of avian and small mammalian brains, revealing similarities in distributed yet interconnected cognitive organization. The researchers propose a new framework for analyzing foundation models that emphasizes the importance of dynamic, cross-regional interactions and neural plasticity in skill acquisition, providing new insights into LLM interpretability and fine-tuning strategies....
