summary: SUPIR (Scaling-UP Image Restoration) is a groundbreaking method that combines
  generative prior and model scaling to achieve realistic and intelligent image restoration.
  It is trained on a dataset of 20 million high-quality images with textual annotations,
  allowing for image restoration guided by textual prompts. It also introduces negative-quality
  prompts to improve perceptual quality and a restoration-guided sampling method to
  suppress fidelity issue encountered in generative-based restoration,...
