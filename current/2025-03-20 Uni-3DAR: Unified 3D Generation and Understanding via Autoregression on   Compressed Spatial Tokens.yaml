summary: Uni-3DAR is a unified framework that combines 3D generation and understanding tasks via autoregressive prediction. It uses a novel hierarchical tokenization method that compresses 3D space using an octree and captures fine-grained structural details, along with optimizations for improved efficiency and effectiveness....
