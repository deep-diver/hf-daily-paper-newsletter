summary: To evaluate the quality of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in disentangling interpretable features in language model (LM) representations, the paper proposes measuring progress in interpretable dictionary learning by using chess and Othello transcripts, which carry natural collections of interpretable features. The paper also introduces a new SAE training technique called p-annealing, which improves performance on prior unsupervised metrics as well as the new metrics....
