summary: This paper introduces a new dataset and method for 3D multimodal question answering in city scenes. The dataset, City-3DQA, is the first to incorporate scene semantic and human-environment interactive tasks within the city. The method, Sg-CityU, uses a scene graph to introduce spatial semantic and achieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness and generalization compared to indoor 3D MQA methods and zero-shot using advanced large language models (LLMs)....
