summary: The researchers created a new system called UniPercept-Bench that helps large language models better understand images on a perceptual level, focusing on aesthetics, quality, structure, and texture. They built a hierarchy to define these features and gathered large datasets to test the system. UniPercept, a strong baseline, was developed using this framework and outperforms existing models in image understanding, which can also be used to improve text-to-image generation....
