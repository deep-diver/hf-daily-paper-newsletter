summary: The paper proposes Efficient-vDiT, a more efficient video diffusion transformer that addresses the inefficiency issue of DiTs through pruning 3D full attention based on video data redundancy and adopting multi-step consistency distillation for shortening the sampling process. Efficient-vDiT significantly improves video generation speed with minimal performance trade-off....
