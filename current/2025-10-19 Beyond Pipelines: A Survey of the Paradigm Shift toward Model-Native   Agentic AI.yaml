summary: This survey explores the shift in agentic AI from traditional pipeline-based systems to model-native ones, where capabilities like planning, tool use, and memory are internalized within the model's parameters. The transformation is driven by Reinforcement Learning, which allows models to learn from outcomes, leading to advancements in applications like long-horizon reasoning and embodied interaction....
