summary: This paper introduces a new dataset called WebSight, which contains 2 million
  pairs of HTML codes and their corresponding screenshots. The authors fine-tune a
  vision-language model on this dataset and show that it can convert webpage screenshots
  into functional HTML code. They hope that this dataset will help advance research
  in this area....
