summary: The paper introduces ETCH, a new method for fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud. ETCH uses a cloth-to-body surface mapping with locally approximate SE(3) equivariance to estimate tightness as displacement vectors, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing and shape accuracy, and even reduces directional errors in one-shot settings....
