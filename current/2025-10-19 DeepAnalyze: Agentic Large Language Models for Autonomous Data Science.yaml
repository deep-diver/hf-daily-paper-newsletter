summary: The study presents DeepAnalyze-8B, an agentic language model that automates the entire data analysis process, from raw data to research reports, by learning through a curriculum-based training method and a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework. Experiments show that DeepAnalyze, with 8B parameters, outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on advanced proprietary language models....
