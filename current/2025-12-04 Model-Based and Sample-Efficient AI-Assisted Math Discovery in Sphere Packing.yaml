summary: The study tackles the challenging problem of sphere packing, which involves arranging spheres in n-dimensional space to achieve maximum density. The researchers introduce a new method that turns this problem into a game, where a policy constructs high-precision mathematical programs to test different packing configurations. By using a smart, efficient approach that combines two powerful search techniques, they discover new upper bounds for sphere packing in dimensions 4-16, demonstrating that th...
