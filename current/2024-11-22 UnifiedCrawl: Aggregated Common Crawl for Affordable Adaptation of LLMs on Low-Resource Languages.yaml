summary: We developed a method to collect text data for low-resource languages from the Common Crawl corpus efficiently, resulting in larger datasets than before. Our approach, UnifiedCrawl, filters and extracts common crawl using minimal compute resources. We fine-tuned multilingual LLMs using this data and efficient adapter methods (QLoRA), which significantly boosted performance on low-resource languages while minimizing VRAM usage. Our experiments showed improvements in language modeling perplexity a...
