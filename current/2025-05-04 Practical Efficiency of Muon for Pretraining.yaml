summary: The study shows that Muon, a simplified second-order optimizer, outperforms AdamW in terms of compute-time tradeoff and data efficiency, especially with large batch sizes. They also introduce a new algorithm that improves hyperparameter transfer and error accounting for Muon, which is validated through experiments with models up to four billion parameters....
