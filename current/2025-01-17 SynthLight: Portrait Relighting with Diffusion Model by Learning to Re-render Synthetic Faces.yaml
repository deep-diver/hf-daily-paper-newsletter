summary: 'This paper presents SynthLight, a diffusion model that uses a physically-based rendering engine to simulate lighting-conditioned transformations in 3D head assets. It introduces two strategies to bridge the gap between synthetic and real image domains: multi-task training and an inference time diffusion sampling procedure. SynthLight generalizes to real photographs and produces realistic illumination effects while preserving the subject''s identity....'
