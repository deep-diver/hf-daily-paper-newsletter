summary: This paper proposes a new method for creating better instruction data for multimodal large language models. It uses an iterative approach to improve the complexity and variety of the data, and it tests the effectiveness of this data by training a model on it and comparing its performance to a model trained on the original data. The new model performs better across 13 different tasks....
