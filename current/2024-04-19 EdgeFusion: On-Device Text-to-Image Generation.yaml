summary: 'This paper introduces a method to generate photo-realistic images from text on resource-limited edge devices with low latency, using a compact variant of Stable Diffusion and two strategies: leveraging high-quality image-text pairs and designing an advanced distillation process. This is achieved through quantization, profiling, and on-device deployment, with results in just two steps....'
