summary: The researchers present a new method called Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization (BGPO) that addresses the memory issue in training large language models using reinforcement learning. BGPO improves the accuracy of training by using a larger sample size, leading to better performance in tasks like math problem-solving, code generation, and planning....
