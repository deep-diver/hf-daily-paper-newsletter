summary: DiPaCo is a new approach for training ML models in a distributed manner, by distributing computation through shared modules. It reduces communication and allows training on poorly connected and heterogeneous workers, and at inference time only a single path is executed without model compression. Experiments show improved performance compared to a 1 billion-parameter dense transformer model....
