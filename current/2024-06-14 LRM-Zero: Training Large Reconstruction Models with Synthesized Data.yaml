summary: The paper introduces LRM-Zero, a Large Reconstruction Model trained on synthesized 3D data called Zeroverse. Zeroverse is rich in intricate details and helps LRM-Zero achieve high-quality 3D reconstruction of real-world objects, even without considering global semantics. The authors also analyze key design choices in Zeroverse that contribute to LRM-Zero's capability and stability. They demonstrate that 3D reconstruction can be achieved without requiring real-world object semantics. The Zerovers...
