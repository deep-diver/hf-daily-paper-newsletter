summary: This paper introduces a new method called 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which uses 3D smooth convex shapes instead of Gaussians to represent 3D scenes. This method is better at capturing hard edges and flat surfaces, and it uses fewer primitives than the previous method. It also has faster rendering speeds and better results on benchmarks like Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending....
