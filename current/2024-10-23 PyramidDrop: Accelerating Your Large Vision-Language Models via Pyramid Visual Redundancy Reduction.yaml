summary: This paper introduces PyramidDrop, a method to make large vision-language models more efficient by reducing the number of image tokens in the model without losing too much information. They do this by dropping some image tokens in the deeper layers of the model, which are less important. This can make the model faster and use less computer resources, while still working well. The method can also be used to make models faster for inference without having to retrain them, and it works better than ...
