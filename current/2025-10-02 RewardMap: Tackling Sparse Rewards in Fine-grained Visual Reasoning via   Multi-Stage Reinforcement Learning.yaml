summary: This study presents RewardMap, a multi-stage reinforcement learning framework that enhances fine-grained visual understanding and reasoning abilities in multimodal large language models. By introducing a difficulty-aware reward design and a multi-stage RL scheme, RewardMap effectively addresses the challenges of sparse rewards and unstable optimization, leading to improved performance on various benchmarks....
