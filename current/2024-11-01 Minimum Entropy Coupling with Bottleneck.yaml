summary: This paper introduces a new way to compress information using a method called Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck. This method allows for a controlled amount of randomness in the compression process, which is useful for situations where the information being compressed might change. The paper also provides a way to solve this problem using a greedy algorithm and shows how it can be used in a game called Markov Coding Games....
