summary: 'This paper proposes a framework called Think-and-Execute, which decomposes algorithmic reasoning in language models into two steps: generating a task-level logic with pseudocode and simulating its execution for each instance. This approach improves language models'' reasoning compared to instance-specific reasoning and suggests the helpfulness of using pseudocode....'
