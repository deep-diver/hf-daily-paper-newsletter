summary: The paper introduces a new approach called Wavelet Latent Diffusion, or WaLa, to efficiently train large-scale 3D generative models with minimal loss of detail. This is achieved by compressing 3D shapes into wavelet-based, compact latent encodings, which allows for high-quality, high-resolution generation at a fast speed. The models, both conditional and unconditional, contain approximately one billion parameters and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets....
