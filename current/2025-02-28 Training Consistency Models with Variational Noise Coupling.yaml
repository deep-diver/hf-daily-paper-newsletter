summary: The paper presents a new approach for Consistency Training (CT) in image generation, using a noise-coupling scheme inspired by Variational Autoencoders (VAE). This method learns the noise-to-data mapping, improving generative performance and achieving state-of-the-art FID on CIFAR-10 and competitive FID on ImageNet at 64x64 resolution....
