summary: We introduce two small protein language models, Llama-3-8B and Phi-3-mini, capable of both uncontrollable and controllable protein generation. Our approach, using LoRA technique, reduces trainable parameters to just 4% of the original model size, lowering computational requirements. Our models are trained on a subset of the UniRef50 dataset and small models, reducing overall training time by 70% without compromising performance. We also demonstrate the deployment of our models on the energy effi...
