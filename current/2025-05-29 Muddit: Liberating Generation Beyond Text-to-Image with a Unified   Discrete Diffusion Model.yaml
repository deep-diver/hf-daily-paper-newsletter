summary: The study presents Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that allows for fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. By integrating strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, Muddit delivers competitive or superior performance compared to larger autoregressive models in terms of quality and efficiency....
