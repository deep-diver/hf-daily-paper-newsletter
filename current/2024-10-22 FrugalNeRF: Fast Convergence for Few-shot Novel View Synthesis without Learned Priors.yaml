summary: FrugalNeRF is a new way to make 3D images from a few pictures. It uses a trick called 'weight-sharing voxels' to make the images faster and more accurately. It also uses a method called 'cross-scale geometric adaptation' to choose the best images to use for training. This makes FrugalNeRF better than other methods and faster to train. It can also use pre-trained images to make the final images even better without slowing down the training process....
