summary: The paper introduces Change State Space Model (CSSM), a model specifically designed for change detection in remote sensing by focusing on relevant changes between bi-temporal images, reducing network parameters, and improving computational efficiency. CSSM has been evaluated on three benchmark datasets and outperformed ConvNets, ViTs, and Mamba-based models at a lower computational complexity....
