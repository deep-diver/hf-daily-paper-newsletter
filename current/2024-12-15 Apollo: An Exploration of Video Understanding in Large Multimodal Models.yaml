summary: This paper explores the factors that contribute to effective video understanding in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The researchers found that scaling consistency is a key factor in transferring design and training decisions from smaller models to larger ones. Based on these findings, they introduced Apollo, a family of LMMs that outperform existing models in video understanding tasks, including hour-long videos....
