summary: The work explores a method for merging multiple models trained on different tasks, addressing performance degradation and high storage costs in model merging. This method averages layers with low parameter conflicts and uses a task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts, further reducing storage costs by decoupling fine-tuned experts into a dense and several sparse experts, and selecting appropriate experts based on task uncertainty for out-of-distribution samples....
