summary: The paper presents a new algorithm, AEPO, that addresses the challenges of relying too much on entropy signals in agentic RL. AEPO balances entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases, improving rollout sampling diversity and maintaining stable policy entropy, which helps in training scalable web agents....
