summary: This paper introduces ScaleQuest, a scalable and novel data synthesis method that uses small-size open-source models to generate questions from scratch, without the need for seed data with complex augmentation constraints. It constructs a mathematical reasoning dataset consisting of 1 million problem-solution pairs, which can increase the performance of mainstream open-source models by achieving significant gains on MATH. Fine-tuning a model with this dataset can even surpass strong and well-ali...
