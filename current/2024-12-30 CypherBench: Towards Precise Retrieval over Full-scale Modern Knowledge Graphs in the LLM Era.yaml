summary: To improve retrieval from graph data for large language models (LLMs), the paper proposes property graph views on top of RDF knowledge graphs. It introduces CypherBench, a benchmark with property graphs for efficient LLM querying. The paper also addresses challenges in converting RDF to property graphs and generating tasks for Cypher....
