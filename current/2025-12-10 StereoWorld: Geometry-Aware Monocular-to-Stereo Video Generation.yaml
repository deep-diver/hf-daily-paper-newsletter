summary: The authors present StereoWorld, a framework that uses artificial intelligence to create high-quality stereo videos from single videos, making the process more affordable and reducing artifacts. They also created a large dataset of high-definition stereo videos to train and test their method, which outperforms existing techniques in producing realistic and geometrically accurate stereo videos....
