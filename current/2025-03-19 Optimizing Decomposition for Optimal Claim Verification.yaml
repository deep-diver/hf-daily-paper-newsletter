summary: The study addresses the issue that current research on the Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text overlooks the interactions between decomposition and verification, leading to suboptimal results. The paper proposes dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity, which outperforms existing decomposition policies....
