summary: The abstract introduces AdaptiveStep, a method that automatically divides reasoning steps based on a model's confidence level in predicting the next word, rather than using rule-based techniques. This method enhances downstream tasks like reward model learning, without the need for manual annotation, and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks....
