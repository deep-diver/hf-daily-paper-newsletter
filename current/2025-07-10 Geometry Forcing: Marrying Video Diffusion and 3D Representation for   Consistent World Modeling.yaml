summary: The authors present a method called Geometry Forcing to improve video diffusion models by incorporating 3D representations. They achieve this by aligning the model's intermediate representations with a pretrained geometric foundation model using two alignment objectives, resulting in better visual quality and 3D consistency in generated videos....
