summary: This paper proposes a method called Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers (HPT) to improve the performance of policy representations in robot learning by pre-training a large, shareable trunk of a policy neural network to learn a task and embodiment agnostic shared representation. The method is tested on multiple simulator benchmarks and real-world settings and outperforms several baselines....
