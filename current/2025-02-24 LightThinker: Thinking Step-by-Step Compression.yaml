summary: The authors present LightThinker, a new method that helps large language models compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning, inspired by human cognitive processes, to reduce memory and computational costs while maintaining accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. They introduce the Dependency metric to measure the reliance on historical tokens during generation, and their experiments demonstrate that LightThinker reduces peak memory usage and inference time without sacrificing performance....
