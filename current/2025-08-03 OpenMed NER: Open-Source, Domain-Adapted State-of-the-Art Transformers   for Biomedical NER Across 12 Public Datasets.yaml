summary: The study presents OpenMed NER, a collection of open-source, domain-adapted transformer models for biomedical named-entity recognition. These models utilize lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training and parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 10 out of 12 biomedical NER benchmarks while maintaining computational efficiency....
