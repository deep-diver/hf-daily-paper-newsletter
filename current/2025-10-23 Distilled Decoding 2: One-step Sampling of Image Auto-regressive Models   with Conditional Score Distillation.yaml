summary: The authors present a method called Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2) that allows for faster generation of images using auto-regressive models with minimal loss in quality. DD2 improves upon a previous method by eliminating the need for a pre-defined mapping and reduces the performance gap between one-step sampling and the original model by 67%....
