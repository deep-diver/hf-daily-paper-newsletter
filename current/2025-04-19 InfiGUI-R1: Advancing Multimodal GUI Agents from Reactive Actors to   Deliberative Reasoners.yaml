summary: The study presents InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent that evolves from a basic reasoner to a deliberative one using a two-stage training approach called Actor2Reasoner. The first stage focuses on teaching spatial reasoning, while the second stage refines the agent's reasoning abilities through reinforcement learning, resulting in strong performance in GUI tasks....
