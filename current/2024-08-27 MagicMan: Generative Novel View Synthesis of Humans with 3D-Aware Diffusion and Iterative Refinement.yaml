summary: MagicMan is a human-specific multi-view diffusion model that uses a pre-trained 2D diffusion model and the SMPL-X model to generate high-quality novel view images from a single reference image. It uses hybrid multi-view attention, a geometry-aware dual branch, and iterative refinement to improve consistency and accuracy of the generated images....
