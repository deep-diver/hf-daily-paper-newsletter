summary: The authors propose a new framework called ECoRAG that improves the performance of large language models in question answering tasks by compressing retrieved documents based on their evidentiality. This method ensures that the model only uses relevant information, reducing latency and token usage, and can retrieve more information if needed, resulting in better performance and cost-efficiency compared to existing compression methods....
