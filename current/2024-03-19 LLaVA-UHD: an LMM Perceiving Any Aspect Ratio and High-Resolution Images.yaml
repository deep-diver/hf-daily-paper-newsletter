summary: 'This paper presents LLaVA-UHD, a large multimodal model that can efficiently
  perceive images in any aspect ratio and high resolution. The model includes three
  key components: an image modularization strategy, a compression module, and a spatial
  schema. LLaVA-UHD outperforms established LMMs on 9 benchmarks, supports larger
  resolution images with minimal computation, and can be efficiently trained in academic
  settings....'
