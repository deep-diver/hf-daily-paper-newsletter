summary: We present a new method for creating smooth and dynamic transitions between frames in videos using video-level diffusion models. Our approach doesn't require any additional training and uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to model latent representations. We also introduce interpolation-based conditional controls and a Frequency-aware Bidirectional Fusion (FBiF) architecture to enhance temporal control and transition reliability. Our method produces high-quality transition videos, as shown in ...
