summary: This paper proposes LLaMA-Mesh, a method to generate 3D meshes using large language models (LLMs) by representing mesh data as text. The approach overcomes challenges in tokenizing mesh data and demonstrates the potential for LLMs to acquire complex spatial knowledge for 3D mesh generation, while maintaining strong text generation performance....
