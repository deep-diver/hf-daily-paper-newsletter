summary: This paper proposes a framework called HDFlow to improve the performance of large language models on complex reasoning problems. It combines fast and slow thinking modes in an adaptive manner and proposes a new approach called Dynamic Workflow to automatically decompose complex problems into sub-tasks and design a workflow to solve them. The framework also includes a method to train smaller LLMs on a large-scale dataset to internalize hybrid reasoning strategies. Experiments show that HDFlow sig...
