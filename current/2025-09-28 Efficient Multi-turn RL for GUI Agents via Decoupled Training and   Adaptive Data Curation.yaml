summary: The authors present a new framework called DART that improves the efficiency of training vision-language model based GUI agents for complex desktop and mobile tasks by decoupling the training system into four asynchronous modules, resulting in higher GPU and environment utilization. Additionally, they introduce an adaptive data curation scheme that enhances learning from abundant samples, leading to a significant improvement in task success rate on the OSWorld benchmark compared to the base mode...
