summary: The paper focuses on improving the performance of smaller language models by enhancing their text embeddings through contrastive fine-tuning. The authors select three models, MiniCPM, Phi-2, and Gemma, and test them on the NLI dataset. MiniCPM shows the most significant improvements, with an average performance gain of 56.33%. The code for contrastive fine-tuning is available on GitHub....
