summary: The authors present a method to create realistic robot manipulation videos by translating human interaction videos, without needing paired human-robot videos for training. They use a transferable representation to bridge the gap between humans and robots, and fine-tune a state-of-the-art video diffusion model to generate high-quality robot videos that mimic human actions, achieving more realistic and grounded robot motions compared to baselines....
