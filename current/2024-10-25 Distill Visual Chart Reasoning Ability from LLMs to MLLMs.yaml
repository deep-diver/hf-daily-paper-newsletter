summary: The paper introduces a method called Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT) to improve the visual reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by using code to translate visual chart representations into textual representations. The paper also presents a dataset called ReachQA, which contains 3k reasoning-intensive charts and 20k Q&A pairs, to enhance both recognition and reasoning abilities. Experiments show that when fine-tuned with the ReachQA dataset, models perform well o...
