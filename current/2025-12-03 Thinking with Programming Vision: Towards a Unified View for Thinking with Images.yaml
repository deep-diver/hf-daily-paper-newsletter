summary: The study presents CodeVision, a flexible framework that allows models to generate code for any image operation, improving tool-based reasoning for multimodal large language models. This approach addresses the brittleness of current models when dealing with simple image changes or corruptions, enhancing performance through a two-stage training methodology and introducing new datasets and benchmarks for evaluation....
