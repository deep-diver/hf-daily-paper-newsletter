summary: The study investigates how different training methods affect the importance of layers in vision models for ImageNet-1k classification. It finds that improved training regimes and self-supervised training increase the importance of early layers, while adversarial training prioritizes deeper layers. The results provide insights into the inner workings of neural networks....
