summary: This research presents a new method to create complex chart datasets using a code-driven pipeline, which helps improve the visual reasoning abilities of multimodal large language models. The resulting ChartM^3 dataset includes 38,000 charts and 142,000 question-answer pairs for training, and it has been shown to significantly enhance model performance in complex chart comprehension tasks....
