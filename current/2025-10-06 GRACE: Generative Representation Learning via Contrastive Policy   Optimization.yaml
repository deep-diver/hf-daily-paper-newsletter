summary: GRACE is a new framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to be more interpretable by using contrastive signals as rewards to guide a generative policy, creating human-understandable explanations for its understanding. This method improves the overall score by 11.5% in the supervised setting and adds 6.9% in the unsupervised variant on the MTEB benchmark, while maintaining its general capabilities....
