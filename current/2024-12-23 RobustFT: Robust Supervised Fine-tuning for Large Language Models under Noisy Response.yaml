summary: The paper proposes a noise-robust SFT framework called RobustFT to enhance large language models' performance on downstream tasks. RobustFT uses a multi-expert collaborative system for noise detection, a context-enhanced strategy for denoising, and an effective data selection mechanism based on response entropy....
