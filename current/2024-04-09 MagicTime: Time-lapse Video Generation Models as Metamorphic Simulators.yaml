summary: This paper proposes MagicTime, a model for generating high-quality and dynamic metamorphic videos from time-lapse videos by learning physical knowledge of the real world. The model uses a decoupled spatial and temporal training scheme, dynamic frames extraction strategy, and improved text encoder. The authors also create a new time-lapse video-text dataset called ChronoMagic to evaluate the model's performance....
