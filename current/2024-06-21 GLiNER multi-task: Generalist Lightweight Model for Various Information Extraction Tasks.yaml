summary: This paper introduces a new model called GLiNER that can be used for various information extraction tasks, such as named entity recognition, question-answering, summarization, and relation extraction. The model is small and efficient, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot named entity recognition benchmarks and leading performance on other tasks. The paper also covers experimental results on self-learning approaches for named entity recognition using GLiNER models....
