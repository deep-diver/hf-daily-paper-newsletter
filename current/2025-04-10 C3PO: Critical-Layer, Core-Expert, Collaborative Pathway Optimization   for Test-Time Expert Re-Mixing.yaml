summary: The paper introduces C3PO, a novel method for optimizing the performance of Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models (LLMs) at test time, by re-weighting or 're-mixing' the experts in different layers based on a surrogate objective defined by the sample's 'successful neighbors'. C3PO focuses on optimizing the core experts' mixing weights in critical layers, improving the base model's accuracy by 7-15% and outperforming other test-time learning baselines....
