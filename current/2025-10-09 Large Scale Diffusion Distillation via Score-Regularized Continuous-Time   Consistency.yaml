summary: The authors present a new method to improve the efficiency of continuous-time consistency models for large-scale image and video generation. They introduce a parallelism-compatible kernel for training these models on bigger tasks and propose a score-regularized model that enhances visual quality and diversity, outperforming existing methods without requiring additional tuning or hyperparameter searches....
