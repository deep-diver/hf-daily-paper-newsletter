summary: LongSplat is a new method that improves novel view synthesis from long videos with irregular motion and unknown camera positions. It does this by optimizing camera poses and 3D Gaussians together, using learned 3D priors for pose estimation, and efficiently organizing point clouds. This results in better rendering quality, more accurate poses, and faster computation compared to existing methods....
