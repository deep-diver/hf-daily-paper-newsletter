summary: This research explores the impact of low-quality ground truth images in super-resolution datasets on model evaluations, showing that SR performances can be biased by these images. The paper introduces a novel perceptual quality metric, Relative Quality Index (RQI), which measures the quality discrepancy of image pairs and improves consistency with human opinions....
