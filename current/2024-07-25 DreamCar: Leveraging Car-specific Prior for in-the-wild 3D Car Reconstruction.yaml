summary: The paper introduces DreamCar, a method for reconstructing high-quality 3D car models from images. It uses a car-specific dataset and a generative prior to guide the reconstruction process, and proposes a pose optimization method to tackle texture misalignment. The method outperforms existing methods in reconstructing high-quality 3D cars....
