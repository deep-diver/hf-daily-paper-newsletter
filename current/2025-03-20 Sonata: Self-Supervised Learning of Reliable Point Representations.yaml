summary: The authors propose a novel method to improve self-supervised learning for 3D point clouds, which overcomes the challenge of 'geometric shortcut' by obscuring spatial information and relying on input features. The method, called Sonata, demonstrates significant improvement in performance across various tasks and with less data, achieving state-of-the-art results....
