summary: FastVLM is a model that optimizes the trade-off between latency, model size, and accuracy by reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM. It incorporates FastViTHD, a hybrid vision encoder that outputs fewer tokens and reduces encoding time for high-resolution images, achieving a 3.2 times improvement in time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works....
