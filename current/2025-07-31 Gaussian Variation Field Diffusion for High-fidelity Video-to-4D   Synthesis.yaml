summary: The authors propose a new method for creating high-quality 3D animations from videos, addressing challenges in data construction and high-dimensional representation. Their approach, Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE, efficiently encodes 3D shapes, appearance, and motion, and trains a Gaussian Variation Field diffusion model with a Diffusion Transformer. This model outperforms existing methods and generalizes well to real-world video inputs, enabling the generation of high-quality animated ...
