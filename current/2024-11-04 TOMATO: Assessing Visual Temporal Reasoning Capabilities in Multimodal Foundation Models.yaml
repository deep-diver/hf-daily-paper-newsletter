summary: This paper introduces TOMATO, a new benchmark for assessing the visual temporal reasoning capabilities of multimodal foundation models in video understanding. The benchmark includes 1,484 carefully curated questions spanning six tasks, and reveals a significant gap in performance between current models and humans. The authors believe TOMATO will serve as a valuable testbed for evaluating future models and pushing the field towards developing AI systems that can truly understand the human world t...
