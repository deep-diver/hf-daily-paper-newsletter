summary: Kangaroo is a new method for self-speculative decoding in large language models. It uses a fixed shallow sub-network as a self-draft model, with the remaining layers serving as the larger target model. A lightweight adapter module is added to the sub-network to improve its representation ability. It also introduces an early exiting mechanism to increase the token acceptance rate and reduce the drafting steps of the small model....
