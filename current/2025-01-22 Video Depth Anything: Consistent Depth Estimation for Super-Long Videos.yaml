summary: This paper introduces a new method for estimating depth in long videos called Video Depth Anything. It uses a spatial-temporal head and a temporal consistency loss to improve the quality and consistency of the depth estimation, and it can be applied to videos of any length without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. It sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation, and it offers models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with its small...
