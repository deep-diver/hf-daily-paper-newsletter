summary: This paper proposes a new quantization paradigm called SVDQuant to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. It absorbs outliers using a low-rank branch and co-designs an inference engine Nunchaku to cut off redundant memory access, resulting in reduced memory usage and speedup. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness in preserving image quality....
