summary: Router-Tuning is a method that fine-tunes only the router on a small dataset to reduce computational overhead and improve efficiency in transformer models. It also proposes MindSkip to preserve model performance while enhancing efficiency. Experiments show competitive results with 21% speedup and only a 0.2% performance drop.
