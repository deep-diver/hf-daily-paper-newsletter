summary: The study presents PromptQuine, a self-discover prompt optimization framework that improves large language model performance by automatically searching for an effective pruning strategy using low-data regimes. This innovative approach challenges conventional wisdom in prompt design by showing that pruning random demonstrations into 'gibberish' can outperform state-of-the-art techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment....
