summary: The study presents RL-PLUS, a new method for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models in reinforcement learning. RL-PLUS combines internal exploitation with external data, addressing the distributional mismatch and guiding the model towards high-value, unexplored paths. Results show that RL-PLUS outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 69.2% improvement and resolving the capability boundary collapse problem....
