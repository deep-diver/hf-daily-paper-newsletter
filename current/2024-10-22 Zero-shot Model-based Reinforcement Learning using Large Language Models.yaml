summary: This paper explores how Large Language Models can predict the dynamics of continuous Markov decision processes and proposes Disentangled In-Context Learning to address the challenges of handling multivariate data and incorporating the control signal. The approach is tested in two reinforcement learning settings and produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates....
