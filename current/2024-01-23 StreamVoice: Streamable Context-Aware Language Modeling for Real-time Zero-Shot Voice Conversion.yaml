summary: In this paper, the authors introduce StreamVoice, a streaming language model-based
  zero-shot voice conversion model that enables real-time conversion given arbitrary
  speaker prompts and source speech. The model employs a fully causal context-aware
  language model with a temporal-independent acoustic predictor and alternately processes
  semantic and acoustic features at each time step of autoregression. To address the
  potential performance degradation from incomplete context in streaming processing...
