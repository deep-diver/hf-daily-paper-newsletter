summary: The paper proposes a new method called Task Preference Optimization (TPO) to improve multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by incorporating task-specific heads and rich visual labels during training. TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance, and demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks....
