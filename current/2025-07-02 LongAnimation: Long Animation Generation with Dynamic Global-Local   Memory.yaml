summary: The study presents a new framework called LongAnimation for long animation colorization, which addresses the issue of inconsistent colors in long animations by incorporating both local and global information. The framework uses a dynamic global-local paradigm to maintain color consistency over long periods, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving color consistency for open-domain animation colorization tasks....
