summary: The paper presents Seg-Zero, a new framework that uses cognitive reinforcement to interpret user intentions, generate explicit reasoning chains, and produce precise pixel-level masks. Unlike traditional methods, Seg-Zero doesn't rely on supervised fine-tuning and achieves robust zero-shot generalization, outperforming previous models by 18% on the ReasonSeg benchmark....
