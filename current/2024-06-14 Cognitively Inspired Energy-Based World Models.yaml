summary: The paper introduces Energy-Based World Models (EBWM), a new approach for training world models inspired by human cognition. EBWM involves training an Energy-Based Model (EBM) to predict the compatibility of a given context and a predicted future state, enabling models to achieve three key facets of human cognition. The paper also presents a variant of the traditional autoregressive transformer tailored for Energy-Based models, called the Energy-Based Transformer (EBT). EBWM shows better scaling...
