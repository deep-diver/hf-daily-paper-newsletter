summary: The paper presents a method to create large-scale, diverse training data for intelligent humanoid robots by converting human videos into humanoid videos using a generative video editing approach. The approach, called X-Humanoid, adapts a powerful model to handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions, and is trained using a scalable data creation pipeline. The resulting dataset outperforms existing baselines in terms of motion consistency and embodiment correctness....
