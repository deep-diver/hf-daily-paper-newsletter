summary: The study presents Tropical attention, a new attention mechanism that better captures the sharp structures of combinatorial algorithms compared to existing models. This leads to improved performance in out-of-distribution settings, length and value generalization, and robustness against adversarial attacks in algorithmic reasoning tasks....
