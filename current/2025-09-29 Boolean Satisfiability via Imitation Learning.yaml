summary: The authors present ImitSAT, a new approach for the Boolean satisfiability problem that learns from expert decisions to improve the performance of CDCL solvers. By using dense decision-level supervision, ImitSAT reduces propagation counts and runtime, outperforming other learned methods in extensive experiments....
