summary: The researchers address a common issue in fine-tuning large language models using reinforcement learning, where the model's performance on multiple attempts worsens over time despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy. They propose a new framework, DPH-RL, which uses a special type of mathematical measure called f-divergence to help the model retain its diverse knowledge base and improve both single and multiple attempt performance, while also being more efficient to train....
