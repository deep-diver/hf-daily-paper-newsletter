summary: This paper proposes a method called Self-Exploring Language Models (SELM) to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by actively exploring different responses to align them with human intentions. SELM eliminates the need for a separate reward model and enhances exploration efficiency, resulting in improved performance on instruction-following benchmarks and standard academic benchmarks....
