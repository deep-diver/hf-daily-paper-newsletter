summary: The researchers created a new video dataset called MATRIX-11K with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks to study how video generation models represent interactions. They then developed a method called MATRIX, which improves the models' ability to accurately represent interactions by aligning attention in specific layers with the mask tracks from their new dataset....
