summary: PhysTwin is a new framework that creates a realistic, interactive digital twin of deformable objects using videos. It combines physics-informed models for simulation, generative shape models for geometry, and Gaussian splats for rendering, while a novel optimization-based framework recovers complete geometry, infers physical properties, and replicates appearance. PhysTwin works well on various objects, outperforming existing methods in experiments, and can be applied in real-time simulation and ...
