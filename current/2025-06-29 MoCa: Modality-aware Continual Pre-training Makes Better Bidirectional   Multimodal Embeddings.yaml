summary: The authors present a two-stage framework called MoCa that improves bidirectional multimodal embeddings by addressing limitations in current models. The first stage enhances context-aware reasoning, while the second stage uses diverse data to improve generalization and alignment, leading to state-of-the-art results and scalability....
