summary: The authors present a new method called MeshSplat that improves the accuracy of reconstructing 3D surfaces from a small number of input images. They achieve this by using a technique called Gaussian Splatting and a feed-forward network to predict pixel-aligned 2D Gaussian Splats, which helps synthesize novel view images and eliminates the need for direct 3D supervision....
