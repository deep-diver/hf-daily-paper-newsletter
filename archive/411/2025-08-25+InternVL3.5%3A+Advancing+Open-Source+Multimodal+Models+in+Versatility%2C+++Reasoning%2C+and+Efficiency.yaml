summary: The authors present InternVL 3.5, an open-source multimodal model that improves versatility, reasoning, and efficiency using a new training strategy called Cascade RL and features like Visual Resolution Router and Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment. These improvements lead to better performance and faster inference, and the model also supports new capabilities like GUI interaction and embodied agency, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source models....
