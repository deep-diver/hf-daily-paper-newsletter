summary: The study presents a new method, MV-RAG, for generating 3D images from text by first finding related 2D images from a large database and then using them to create consistent and accurate 3D outputs. This approach is particularly useful for generating rare or unseen concepts, and the researchers provide a new set of challenging tests to evaluate its performance....
