summary: The study explores the constraints of normalization in attention mechanisms, focusing on token selection and separation. Experiments with the GPT-2 model reveal that as more tokens are chosen, the model struggles to distinguish informative ones, and softmax normalization can be problematic during training, particularly at low temperatures....
