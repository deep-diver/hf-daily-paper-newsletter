summary: This study investigates how different architectures and training methods affect a model's ability to perform multi-step reasoning, using a cellular automata framework. The researchers found that most neural architectures can abstract underlying rules when trained to avoid memorization, but performance drops for multi-step reasoning. They discovered that increasing model depth, along with recurrence, memory, and test-time compute scaling, significantly improves reasoning capabilities....
