summary: The study presents BlockFFN, a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture that improves model performance and acceleration by addressing the limitations of traditional MoE. It introduces a differentiable router, promotes both token-level and chunk-level sparsity, and implements efficient acceleration kernels, resulting in significant performance improvements and speedup on end-side devices....
