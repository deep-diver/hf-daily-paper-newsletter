summary: This study explores why multimodal large language models sometimes give incorrect or imaginary answers in real-world tasks, focusing on the issue of conflicting information from different input sources like images and text. They created a new dataset to test this problem and proposed three methods to improve the models' performance, with one method, reinforcement learning, working the best....
