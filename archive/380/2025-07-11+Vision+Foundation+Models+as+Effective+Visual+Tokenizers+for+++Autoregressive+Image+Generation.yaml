title: Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for   Autoregressive Image Generation
thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.08441
summary: The study utilizes pre-trained vision foundation models to create an efficient image tokenizer, VFMTok, which outperforms existing methods in image reconstruction and generation quality. This new tokenizer enhances autoregressive generation, achieves high fidelity class-conditional synthesis, and accelerates model convergence, all without requiring classifier-free guidance....
