summary: The paper describes two new sequence models, Eagle and Finch, that improve upon the RWKV architecture. These models have multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism, which improves their expressivity while maintaining the inference efficiency of RNNs. The models were trained on a new multilingual corpus and achieve competitive performance on various benchmarks. The models are released under the Apache 2.0 license and the training and inference code is available on Github...
