summary: The authors present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a more affordable and faster monolithic multimodal large language model that integrates visual encoding and language decoding into a single model. They address optimization issues and catastrophic forgetting by embedding a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained language model, resulting in competitive performance with lower training and inference costs compared to previous models....
