summary: 'Research on scaling test-time compute for improving reasoning in large language models (LLMs) explores two methods: Self-Consistency (SC) and Generative Reward Models (GenRM). SC generates multiple solutions and selects the most common answer, while GenRM scores solutions via a reward model. The study compares SC and GenRM under a fixed inference budget and finds that SC is more compute-efficient for most practical budgets. Additionally, inference scaling laws for GenRM reveal that optimal compu...'
