summary: MixerMDM is a new method that learns to combine pre-trained human motion diffusion models for finer control in motion generation, by dynamically mixing the denoising process of each model depending on the conditions. It allows for individual control over each person's motion and overall interaction, and introduces a new evaluation technique that measures the interaction and individual quality of the generated motions....
