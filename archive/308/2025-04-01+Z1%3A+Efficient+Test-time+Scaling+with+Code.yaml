summary: The paper introduces a novel method of efficient test-time scaling for Large Language Models (LLMs) by training them on code-related reasoning trajectories. A dataset of coding problems with short and long solution trajectories is used, along with a Shifted Thinking Window to reduce overthinking overhead. Trained with this data, the Z1-7B model can adjust its reasoning level based on problem complexity, matching performance with fewer thinking tokens....
