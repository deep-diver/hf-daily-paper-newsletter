summary: The paper presents GeometryCrafter, a new method for recovering high-fidelity point map sequences from open-world videos, enabling accurate 3D/4D reconstruction and other depth-based applications. It uses a point map VAE to learn a latent space agnostic to video latent distributions, and a video diffusion model for point map sequence distribution modeling....
