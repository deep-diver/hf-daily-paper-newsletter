summary: This study investigates the multimodal gap between Visual Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). The researchers found that visual SSL models perform better than CLIP models when scaled up in terms of data and model capacity, and can match CLIP-level performance on various VQA and classic vision benchmarks, suggesting that pure visual SSL can match language-supervised visual pretraining at scale....
