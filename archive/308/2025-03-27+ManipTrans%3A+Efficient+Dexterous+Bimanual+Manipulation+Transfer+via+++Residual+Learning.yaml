summary: 'The paper presents ManipTrans, a method to efficiently transfer human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands using two stages: pre-training a generalist trajectory imitator and fine-tuning a residual module under interaction constraints. Experiments show superior success rate, fidelity, and efficiency compared to existing methods, and the authors introduce DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring complex tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing....'
