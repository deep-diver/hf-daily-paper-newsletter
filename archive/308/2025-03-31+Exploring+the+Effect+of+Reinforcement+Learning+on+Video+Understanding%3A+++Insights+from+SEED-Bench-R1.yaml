summary: The study evaluates the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) in improving video understanding for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using a new benchmark called SEED-Bench-R1. Results show that RL outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and enhances visual perception, but may overlook visual cues and produce less coherent reasoning chains, suggesting areas for future improvement....
