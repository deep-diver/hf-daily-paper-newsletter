summary: The study introduces Grounded 3D-LLM, a unified generative framework that uses scene referent tokens to handle 3D vision tasks. It uses large-scale grounded language datasets and Contrastive LAnguage-Scene Pre-training (CLASP) to integrate 3D vision with language models. The model outperforms existing methods in various 3D vision tasks....
