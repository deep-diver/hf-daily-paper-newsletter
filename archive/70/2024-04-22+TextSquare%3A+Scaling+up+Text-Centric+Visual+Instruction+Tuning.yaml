summary: The paper introduces a new approach for creating a large, high-quality instruction-tuning dataset called Square-10M, which is used to improve the performance of text-centric visual instruction models. The method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models and highlights the importance of reasoning data in offering comprehensive insights, which not only improves accuracy but also reduces hallucinations....
