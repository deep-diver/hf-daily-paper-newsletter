summary: This paper explores alternative initialization strategies for the 3D Gaussian Splatting technique, with a goal to overcome its reliance on high-quality point cloud initialization by Structure-from-Motion (SFM) algorithms. It shows that random initialization can perform well when carefully designed and also suggests using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models to achieve comparable or better results to SFM initialization....
