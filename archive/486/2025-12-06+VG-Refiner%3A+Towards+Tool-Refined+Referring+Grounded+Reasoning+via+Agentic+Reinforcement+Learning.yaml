summary: The authors present a new framework called VG-Refiner that improves tool-integrated visual reasoning, specifically in referring and grounding tasks, by addressing the issue of unreliable tool outputs. They introduce a two-stage mechanism for analyzing and responding to tool feedback, along with a refinement reward to encourage corrections, and propose new metrics for evaluating model performance....
