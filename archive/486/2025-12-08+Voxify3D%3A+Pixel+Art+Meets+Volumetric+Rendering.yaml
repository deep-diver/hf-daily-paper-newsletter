summary: 'The authors present a new method called Voxify3D that converts 3D models into pixel art by combining 3D mesh optimization with 2D pixel art supervision. It achieves this through three main components: perspective distortion elimination, semantic preservation, and discrete color space optimization, resulting in high-quality pixel art with better control over aesthetics and abstraction levels....'
