summary: The study investigates the exposure bias issue in scale-wise autoregressive models used for image generation and proposes a new method called Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR). SAR improves generation quality by aligning train-test patterns and providing adequate supervision for self-generated contexts, resulting in a consistent improvement in image generation with minimal computational overhead....
