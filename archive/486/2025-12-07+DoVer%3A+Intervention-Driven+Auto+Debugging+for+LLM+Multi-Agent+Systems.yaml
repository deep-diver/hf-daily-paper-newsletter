summary: The researchers present a new framework called DoVer that improves debugging of large language model-based multi-agent systems by actively testing hypotheses through targeted actions and focusing on outcomes rather than just attributing errors to specific agents or steps. This approach enhances system reliability and paves the way for more effective debugging methods in the future....
