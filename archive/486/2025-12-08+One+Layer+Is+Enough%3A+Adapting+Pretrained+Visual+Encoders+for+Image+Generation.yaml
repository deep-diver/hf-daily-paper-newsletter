summary: The authors present FAE, a straightforward method to adjust pre-trained visual representations into compact latent spaces for image generation, using a single attention layer. This approach effectively combines two decoders for feature reconstruction and image generation, achieving strong performance on various benchmarks, including near state-of-the-art FID scores on ImageNet 256x256....
