summary: The researchers present a new method called ContextFlow that enables precise manipulation of objects in videos without requiring training. This technique uses a high-order solver and a mechanism called Adaptive Context Enrichment to improve accuracy and consistency in object editing, specifically designed for Diffusion Transformers. Experiments show that ContextFlow outperforms existing training-free methods and even some training-based approaches, producing high-quality and coherent video edits...
