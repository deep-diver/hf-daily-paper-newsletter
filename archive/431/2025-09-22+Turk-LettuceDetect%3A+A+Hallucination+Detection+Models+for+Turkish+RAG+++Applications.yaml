summary: The study presents Turk-LettuceDetect, the first set of hallucination detection models tailored for Turkish RAG applications, addressing the issue of generating incorrect information in complex languages like Turkish. The models, based on a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT, have been trained on a machine-translated dataset and demonstrate high efficiency and precision in detecting hallucinations....
