summary: The authors present a new framework called MetaEmbed for multimodal retrieval that creates efficient and expressive multi-vector embeddings by using learnable Meta Tokens during training. This allows users to adjust retrieval quality and efficiency at test-time, and extensive evaluations show that MetaEmbed outperforms existing methods while scaling to large models....
