summary: The study presents a new robotic wrist named ByteWrist, designed for precise motion in tight spaces. Its unique three-stage parallel drive mechanism and arc-shaped end linkages allow for flexible and anthropomorphic motion, making it ideal for tasks like home services and medical assistance, and it performs better than existing systems in narrow-space maneuverability....
