summary: The study presents a new method called Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) that uses large language models to adaptively generate and refine Gaussian process kernels for Bayesian optimization. This approach, combined with the BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) technique, outperforms existing methods in various real-world tasks, such as hyperparameter optimization and photonic chip design....
