summary: The researchers present a new framework called TempSamp-R1 that improves the performance of video temporal grounding tasks by using ground-truth annotations for off-policy supervision, providing temporally precise guidance. TempSamp-R1 also employs a hybrid training paradigm to optimize a single model for different inference modes, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets and robust few-shot generalization capabilities....
