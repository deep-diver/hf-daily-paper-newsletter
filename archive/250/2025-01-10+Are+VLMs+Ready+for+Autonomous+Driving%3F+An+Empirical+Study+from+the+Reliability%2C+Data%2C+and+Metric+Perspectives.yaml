summary: This paper introduces DriveBench, a benchmark dataset to evaluate the reliability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for autonomous driving. The findings show that VLMs often generate plausible responses derived from general knowledge or textual cues instead of true visual grounding, especially under degraded or missing visual inputs. To address these challenges, the paper proposes refined evaluation metrics that prioritize robust visual grounding and multi-modal understanding. The benchmark toolk...
