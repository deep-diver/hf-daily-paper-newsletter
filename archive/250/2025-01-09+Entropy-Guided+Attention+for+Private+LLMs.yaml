summary: This paper introduces an information-theoretic framework and an entropy-guided attention mechanism to optimize transformer architectures for private inference in language models, addressing communication and latency overheads caused by nonlinear operations. It also proposes a novel entropy regularization technique to mitigate entropic overload and explores PI-friendly alternatives to layer normalization for preventing entropy collapse....
