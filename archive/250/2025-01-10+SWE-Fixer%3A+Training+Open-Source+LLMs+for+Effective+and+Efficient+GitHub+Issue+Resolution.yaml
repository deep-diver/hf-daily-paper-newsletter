summary: 'The paper proposes SWE-Fixer, an open-source LLM that effectively and efficiently resolves GitHub issues by using two modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. It outperforms other open-source models on SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with scores of 23.3% and 30.2% respectively. The model, dataset, and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer....'
