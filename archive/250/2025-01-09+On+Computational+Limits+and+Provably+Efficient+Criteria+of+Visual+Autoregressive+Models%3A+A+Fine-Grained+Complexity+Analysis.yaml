summary: This paper analyzes the computational efficiency of Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) and identifies conditions under which they can achieve sub-quadratic time complexity. The authors establish a critical threshold for input matrices used in VAR attention mechanisms and present efficient constructions leveraging low-rank approximations. The work initiates the study of computational efficiency in VAR models and aims to advance scalable and efficient image generation....
