summary: This research proposes a new loss function, MFD, to reduce oscillations in Consistency Models' training, leading to faster training times and better sample quality, even with small batch sizes. The method, named Align Your Tangent (AYT), aligns the model's updates with the data manifold, outperforming LPIPS and enabling efficient training....
