summary: The study presents the first comprehensive benchmark on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. It categorizes these attacks, constructs datasets for both malicious and benign samples, systematizes text-based and image-based detection methods, and evaluates their performance. Key findings reveal that while some detectors work moderately to high accuracy against explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations, they struggle with attacks that omit explicit instruction...
