summary: The study presents a new method called Orthogonal Sparse Autoencoders (OrtSAE) that addresses issues in sparse autoencoders, such as feature absorption and composition, by promoting orthogonality between learned features. This approach leads to more distinct features, improved performance on spurious correlation removal, and comparable performance on other tasks compared to traditional sparse autoencoders....
