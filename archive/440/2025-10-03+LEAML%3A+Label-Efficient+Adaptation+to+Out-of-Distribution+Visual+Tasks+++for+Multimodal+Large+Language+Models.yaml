summary: The paper presents a new method called LEAML that helps advanced language models understand visual tasks in specific areas like medical imaging, where there's little labeled data. LEAML uses both limited labeled and abundant unlabeled images, creating fake questions and answers for the unlabeled data and updating only the relevant parts of the model, which improves performance in tasks like gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA with minimal supervision....
