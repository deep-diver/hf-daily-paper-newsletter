summary: This research presents RH-AUC, a new metric to measure how well multimodal models maintain visual accuracy as reasoning length increases. They also introduce RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for assessing the balance between reasoning ability and hallucination in models. The study finds that larger models generally perform better in this balance and that the types and domains of training data have a bigger impact on this balance than the amount of data....
