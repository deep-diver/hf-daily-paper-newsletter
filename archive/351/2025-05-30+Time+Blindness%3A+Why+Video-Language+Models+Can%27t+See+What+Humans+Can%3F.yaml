summary: SpookyBench is a new benchmark that tests video-language models' ability to understand information encoded solely in temporal sequences of noisy frames. While humans can easily recognize patterns in these sequences, state-of-the-art models struggle, highlighting the need for new architectures or training methods to improve machines' understanding of temporal patterns....
