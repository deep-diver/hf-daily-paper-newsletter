summary: The study presents a new method to improve the realism and precision of whole-body manipulation of articulated objects by coordinating the motion of the body and hands, and using a unified representation for hand-object interaction. The proposed framework outperforms existing approaches in generating high-quality and physically plausible motion, enabling various capabilities such as object pose control and simultaneous walking and manipulation....
