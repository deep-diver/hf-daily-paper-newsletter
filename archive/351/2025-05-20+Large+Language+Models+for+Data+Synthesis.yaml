summary: This study presents a new framework called LLMSynthor that uses Large Language Models to create realistic synthetic data without relying on strict mathematical assumptions or manual design. LLMSynthor efficiently generates data by leveraging LLMs as nonparametric copula simulators and improving sampling efficiency through a novel method called LLM Proposal Sampling. The resulting synthetic data demonstrates high statistical accuracy, practical usefulness, and adaptability across various domains....
