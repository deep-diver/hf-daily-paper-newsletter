summary: The study compares using Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o for generating structured outputs, specifically low-code workflows in JSON form. It finds that while LLMs can be effective with the right prompt, SLMs still have a 10% quality advantage when fine-tuned for such tasks, and also identifies the limitations of both models through error analysis....
