summary: This study explores the idea that hidden units in recurrent neural networks can actively participate in computations, rather than just storing information. The researchers revisit bi-linear operations, which involve multiplication between hidden units and input embeddings, and show that they are a natural fit for modeling the evolution of hidden states in tasks requiring active hidden unit contribution. They also find that bi-linear state updates form a hierarchy of increasing complexity, with l...
