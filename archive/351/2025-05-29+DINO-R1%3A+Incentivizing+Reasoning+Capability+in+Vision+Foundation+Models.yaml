summary: This study presents DINO-R1, a new method that enhances the reasoning abilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement learning, specifically for query-based representation models. DINO-R1 introduces GRQO, a training strategy that calculates query-level rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality, and uses KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution, resulting in improved performance on visual prompting tasks compared to supervised fine-tuning baselines....
