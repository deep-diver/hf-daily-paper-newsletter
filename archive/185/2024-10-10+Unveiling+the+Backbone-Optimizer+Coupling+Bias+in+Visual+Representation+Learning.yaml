summary: This paper investigates the interplay between vision backbones and optimizers, revealing a phenomenon called backbone-optimizer coupling bias (BOCB). It highlights the co-dependency between specific backbones and optimizers and discusses the impact of BOCB on pre-training and fine-tuning vision models. The paper provides insights into recommended optimizers and robust backbone architectures, and the source code and models are available online....
