summary: We introduce a new metric called Modality Integration Rate (MIR) to evaluate the quality of pre-training in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). MIR is effective, robust, and generalized, and can help in choosing training data, designing efficient modules, and guiding the development of LVLMs....
