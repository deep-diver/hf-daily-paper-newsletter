summary: This paper proposes a unified pyramidal flow matching algorithm that reduces the computational demands of video generative modeling by operating at a lower resolution and enabling interlinking of flows. The method supports generating high-quality videos at 768p resolution and 24 FPS within 20.7k A100 GPU training hours....
