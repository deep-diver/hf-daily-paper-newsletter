summary: A new method named GRA is proposed for data synthesis, which uses multiple small language models to play specific roles instead of relying on a single large model. In this method, a Generator produces initial data samples, a Reviewer evaluates their quality, and an Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. Experiments show that GRA-produced data is comparable or even superior to the output of a single large model, challenging the need for monolithic large models for high-quality dat...
