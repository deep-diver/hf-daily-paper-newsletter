summary: The paper presents REVERSE, a unified framework for reducing visual hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by combining hallucination-aware training with on-the-fly self-verification. This approach is built upon a new dataset and an inference-time retrospective resampling technique, achieving state-of-the-art hallucination reduction compared to existing methods....
