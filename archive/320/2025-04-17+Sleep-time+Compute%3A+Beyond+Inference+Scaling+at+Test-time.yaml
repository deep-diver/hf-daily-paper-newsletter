summary: The paper introduces sleep-time compute, a method to reduce inference cost and latency of large language models (LLMs) by pre-computing useful quantities before queries are presented. Through experiments on two reasoning tasks, the paper demonstrates that sleep-time compute can decrease test-time compute requirements by up to 5x and increase accuracy by up to 18%....
