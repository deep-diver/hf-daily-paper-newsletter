summary: The authors present a novel method for 3D visual grounding using multi-level convolution architecture, addressing the inefficiency of previous methods in real-time inference. They introduce text-guided pruning and completion-based addition to efficiently interact 3D scene representation with text features, resulting in improved accuracy and inference speed....
