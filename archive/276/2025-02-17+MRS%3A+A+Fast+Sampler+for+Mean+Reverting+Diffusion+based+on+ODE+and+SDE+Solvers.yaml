summary: The authors present MRS, a fast sampler for Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion, which reduces the number of function evaluations for higher quality samples. MRS solves the reverse-time SDE and Probability Flow ODE and derives semi-analytical solutions that allow for high-quality samples in fewer steps, providing a 10-20x speedup for image restoration tasks....
