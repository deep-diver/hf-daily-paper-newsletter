summary: The paper proposes a novel integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into cooperative autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication setting. They introduce a new dataset (V2V-QA) and a baseline method (V2V-LLM) that uses an LLM to fuse perception information from multiple connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) for grounding, notable object identification, and planning tasks, showing promising results over other baseline methods....
