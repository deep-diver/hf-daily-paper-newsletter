summary: The paper describes a new fine-tuning method called Selective Self-to-Supervised Fine-Tuning (S3FT) for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhances generalization while improving performance compared to standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). S3FT uses the model's correct responses to reduce specialization, which is evaluated on tasks such as mathematical reasoning, Python programming, and reading comprehension....
