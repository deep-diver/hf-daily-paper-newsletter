summary: The proposed DarwinLM method uses an evolutionary search process with mutation and selection for training-aware structured pruning of large language models, accounting for varying sensitivities of model components towards pruning. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, like outperforming ShearedLlama while needing 5 times less training data during post-compression training....
