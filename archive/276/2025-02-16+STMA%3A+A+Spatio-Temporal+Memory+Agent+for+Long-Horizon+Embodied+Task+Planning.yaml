summary: The authors present a new framework known as the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA) for enhancing long-horizon task planning and execution in dynamic environments. STMA, built on a spatio-temporal memory module, dynamic knowledge graph, and planner-critic mechanism, significantly outperforms existing models in TextWorld environments....
