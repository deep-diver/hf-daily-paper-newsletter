summary: The authors present MM-RLHF, a new approach to aligning multimodal large language models with human preferences using a dataset of 120k fine-grained, human-annotated preference comparison pairs. They propose a critique-based reward model and dynamic reward scaling for more efficient and effective alignment, which they rigorously evaluate across 10 dimensions and 27 benchmarks, showing significant improvements in model performance....
