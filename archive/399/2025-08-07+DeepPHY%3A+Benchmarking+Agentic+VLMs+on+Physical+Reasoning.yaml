summary: The authors present DeepPHY, a new benchmark framework that tests how well Vision Language Models (VLMs) understand and apply physical principles in complex, virtual environments. They found that even the best VLMs struggle with turning knowledge of physics into accurate actions, highlighting a gap that needs to be addressed for real-world applications....
