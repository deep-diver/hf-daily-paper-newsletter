summary: The authors present SODEC, a new single-step diffusion image compression model that addresses the issues of slow decoding and poor image quality in current diffusion-based models. SODEC uses a pre-trained VAE model to create informative latents and a fidelity guidance module to improve image quality, resulting in faster decoding and better rate-distortion-perception performance compared to existing methods....
