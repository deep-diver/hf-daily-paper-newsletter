summary: The authors present a new framework called Hi3DEval for evaluating 3D generated content, which goes beyond existing methods by assessing both object-level and part-level details, as well as material realism. They also create a large-scale dataset called Hi3DBench to support this framework, and their approach proves to be more effective than image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and aligning with human preference....
