summary: The authors propose a new method called Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) to improve the generalization of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Large Language Models (LLMs). DFT addresses the problematic reward structure in SFT by dynamically rescaling the objective function, resulting in significantly better performance across various benchmarks and base models, even competing with offline reinforcement learning settings....
