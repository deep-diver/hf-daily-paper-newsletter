summary: Gen2Act is a method that uses human video generation to enable generalizable robot manipulation in novel scenarios. It casts language-conditioned manipulation as zero-shot human video generation followed by execution with a single policy conditioned on the generated video. Gen2Act uses an order of magnitude less robot interaction data compared to what the video prediction model was trained on and directly uses a pre-trained model for generating human videos. The results show how Gen2Act enables ...
