summary: This paper presents a new method for generating synthetic tabular data by converting it into fixed-size binary representations and using a generative model called Binary Diffusion. This approach is simpler and more efficient than traditional methods, as it eliminates the need for complex preprocessing or large pretrained models, and it outperforms existing models on several popular datasets....
