summary: This paper proposes a method to use one transformer for both autoregression and diffusion in multimodality tasks, which is achieved by sharing the same backbone for both text and visual generation. The transformer is successfully applied to diffusion for visual generation, and the training for autoregression and diffusion is very similar, with the difference lying in the attention mask. Experimental results show that this approach achieves comparable image generation performance to current state...
