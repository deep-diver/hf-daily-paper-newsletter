summary: DynaMo is a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations for visuo-motor control. It uses expert demonstrations to jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings. DynaMo improves downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives and pretrained representations....
