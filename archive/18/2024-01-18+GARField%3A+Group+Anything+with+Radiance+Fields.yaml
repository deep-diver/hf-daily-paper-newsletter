summary: GARField is a method for decomposing 3D scenes into groups of different sizes based on 2D masks provided by Segment Anything. It optimizes a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature field that consistently fuses conflicting masks from different viewpoints. It can automatically construct a hierarchy of groupings, and is evaluated on a variety of scenes, producing higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks. Downstream applications include 3D asset extraction and dynamic scene understanding....
