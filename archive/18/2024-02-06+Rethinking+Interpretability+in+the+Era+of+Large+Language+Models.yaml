summary: Interpretable machine learning has exploded as an area of interest over the
  last decade, sparked by the rise of increasingly large datasets and deep neural
  networks. Simultaneously, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
  capabilities across a wide array of tasks, offering a chance to rethink opportunities
  in interpretable machine learning. Notably, the capability to explain in natural
  language allows LLMs to expand the scale and complexity of patterns that can be
  given to a hu...
