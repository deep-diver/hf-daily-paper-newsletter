summary: The proposed method is a new distillation technique for diffusion bridge models (DBMs), designed to improve their speed and practicality, by addressing the issue of slow inference. This technique can distill both conditional and unconditional DBMs, distill models in a single-step generator, and use only the corrupted images for training, resulting in a 4x to 100x acceleration in DBM inference....
