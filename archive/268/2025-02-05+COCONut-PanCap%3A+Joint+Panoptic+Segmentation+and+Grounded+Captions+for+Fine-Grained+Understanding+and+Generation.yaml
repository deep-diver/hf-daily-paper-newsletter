summary: The COCONut-PanCap dataset is created to advance panoptic segmentation and grounded image captioning, overcoming the limitations of existing datasets. It uses fine-grained, region-level captions grounded in panoptic segmentation masks, resulting in improved performance for vision-language models and text-to-image generative models....
