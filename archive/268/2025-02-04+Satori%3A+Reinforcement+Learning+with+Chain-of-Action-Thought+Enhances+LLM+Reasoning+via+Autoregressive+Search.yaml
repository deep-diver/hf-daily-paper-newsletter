summary: The paper proposes a new approach to improve the reasoning abilities of a single LLM by internalizing searching capabilities. They introduce Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT) reasoning and a two-stage training paradigm to achieve this, resulting in Satori, a 7B LLM that outperforms existing models in mathematical reasoning benchmarks and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks....
