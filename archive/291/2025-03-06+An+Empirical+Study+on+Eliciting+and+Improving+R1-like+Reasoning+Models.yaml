summary: The report explores the use of RL training to improve reasoning models, demonstrating enhanced performance in Qwen2.5-32B base models and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B models. Additionally, it introduces tool manipulation as a technique to significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models, achieving 86.67% accuracy on AIME 2024....
