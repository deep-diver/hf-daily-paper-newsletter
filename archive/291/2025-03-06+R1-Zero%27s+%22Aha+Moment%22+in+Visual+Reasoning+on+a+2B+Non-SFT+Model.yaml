summary: The report details the successful replication of complex reasoning in a multimodal model using reinforcement learning, specifically on a non-SFT 2B model. The model, Qwen2-VL-2B, achieved 59.47% accuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model and exceeding SFT settings. The report also shares insights from failed attempts, highlighting challenges such as trivial reasoning trajectories and ineffective length rewards when applying RL on instruct models....
