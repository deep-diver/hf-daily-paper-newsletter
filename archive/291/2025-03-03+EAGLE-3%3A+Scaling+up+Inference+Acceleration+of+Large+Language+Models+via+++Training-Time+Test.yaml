summary: The paper presents EAGLE-3, an improvement on the EAGLE method, which enhances the inference acceleration of large language models by abandoning feature prediction and adopting direct token prediction, along with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique called training-time test, resulting in up to 6.5x speedup and 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2....
