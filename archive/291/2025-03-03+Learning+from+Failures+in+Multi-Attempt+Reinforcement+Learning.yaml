summary: The research extends the approach of reinforcement learning for large language models by modifying the task into a multi-attempt setting, where the model is allowed multiple attempts with feedback after incorrect responses. This method encourages the model to refine its responses and improve search efficiency, leading to significantly higher accuracy when evaluated with more attempts, compared to a standard single-turn task....
