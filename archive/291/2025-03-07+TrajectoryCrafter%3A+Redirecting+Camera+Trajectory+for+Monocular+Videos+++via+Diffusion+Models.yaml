summary: The authors propose TrajectoryCrafter, a method to change camera movements in monocular videos using a dual-stream video diffusion model. This model conditions on both point cloud renders and source videos, allowing for precise control over camera movements while generating cohesive video content. The model is trained on a hybrid dataset combining web-scale monocular videos and static multi-view datasets, resulting in better generalization across various scenes....
