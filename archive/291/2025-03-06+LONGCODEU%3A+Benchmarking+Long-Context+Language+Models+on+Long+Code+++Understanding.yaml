summary: The research presents LONGCODEU, a benchmark for assessing long code understanding in language models, which is crucial for software engineering applications. The study evaluates popular LCLMs on LONGCODEU and finds that they struggle with long code understanding, particularly in inter-code unit relation understanding, and their performance drops significantly when code length exceeds 32K....
