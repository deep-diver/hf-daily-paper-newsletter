summary: The paper describes LoRACode, a method that uses LoRA adapters for fine-tuning code embeddings. This approach, which reduces trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, significantly improves Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for both Code2Code and Text2Code search tasks compared to existing methods....
