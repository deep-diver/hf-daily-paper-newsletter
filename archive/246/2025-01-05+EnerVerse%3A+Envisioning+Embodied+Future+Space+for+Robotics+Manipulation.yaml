summary: EnerVerse is a framework for generating future spaces specifically designed for robotic manipulation tasks. It uses attention mechanisms to ensure low-level consistency and continuity, and introduces the Free Anchor View (FAV) space to enhance observation and analysis. A data engine pipeline integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian Splatting to improve the quality and diversity of data, narrowing the sim-to-real gap. The embodied future space generation prior enhances policy predictive cap...
