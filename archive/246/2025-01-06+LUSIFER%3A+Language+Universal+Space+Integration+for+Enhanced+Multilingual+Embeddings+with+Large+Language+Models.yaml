summary: LUSIFER is a new approach that adapts large language models for multilingual tasks without requiring multilingual supervision. It combines a multilingual encoder with an LLM-based embedding model and integrates them through a minimal set of trainable parameters. LUSIFER significantly improves multilingual performance across various embedding tasks, particularly for medium and low-resource languages, without requiring explicit multilingual training data....
