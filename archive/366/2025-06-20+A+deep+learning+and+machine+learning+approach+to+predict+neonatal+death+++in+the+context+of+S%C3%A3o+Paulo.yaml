summary: This study used historical data of 1.4 million newborns in São Paulo to develop a prediction model for neonatal death using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The results showed that LSTM, a type of deep learning, had the highest accuracy (99%) in predicting neonatal mortality, making it the most suitable approach for identifying at-risk newborns....
