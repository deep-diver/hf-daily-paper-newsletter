summary: The researchers present a new method called Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR) for creating consistent multi-view images from various prompts. They enhance the model's ability to generate images from different angles by using all previous views and propose a unified model that can handle various conditions, such as text, camera pose, image, and shape. Additionally, they introduce a data augmentation technique to address the limited high-quality data issue, resulting in a model that performs as w...
