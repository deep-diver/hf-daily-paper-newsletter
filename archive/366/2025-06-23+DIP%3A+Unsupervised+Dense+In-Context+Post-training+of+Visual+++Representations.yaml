summary: The authors propose a new method called DIP to improve dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding, without the need for labeled data or complex architectures. DIP achieves strong performance across various tasks by learning through pseudo in-context tasks, outperforming both the initial vision encoder and prior methods....
