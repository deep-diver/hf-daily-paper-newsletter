summary: The research addresses the challenges in universal photometric stereo, which seeks to recover surface normals under various lighting conditions without relying on specific illumination models. The study focuses on separating the deep coupling between illumination and surface normal features and preserving high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces to improve accuracy in capturing subtle normal variations, self-shadowing, and inter-reflections....
