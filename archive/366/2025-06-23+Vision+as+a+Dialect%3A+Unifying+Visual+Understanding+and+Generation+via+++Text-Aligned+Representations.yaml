summary: The authors propose a new framework that combines visual understanding and generation using a shared discrete representation, enabling cross-modal input and output through a unified interface. They introduce a text-aligned tokenizer to convert images into discrete tokens, along with advanced pre-training tasks and two de-tokenizers to improve efficiency and visual detail, resulting in a multimodal model that outperforms existing methods....
