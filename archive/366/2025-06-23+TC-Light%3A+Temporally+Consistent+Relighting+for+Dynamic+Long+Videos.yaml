summary: The authors present TC-Light, a new method for editing lighting in long videos with complex movements, which improves upon existing techniques by addressing issues of temporal consistency and computational efficiency. They introduce a two-stage optimization process to align global illumination and fine-grained texture and lighting, resulting in realistic relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost....
