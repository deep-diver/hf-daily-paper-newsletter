summary: The paper proposes RLPR, a new method that allows LLMs to improve their reasoning skills in various domains without relying on complex verifiers. RLPR uses the LLM's own probability scores to evaluate its reasoning process and make it more accurate. Experiments show that RLPR significantly enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs in both general and mathematical domains, outperforming other methods....
