summary: This paper introduces vision-language models (VLMs), which are computer systems that can understand and generate both images and text. VLMs have many potential applications, but they also face challenges due to the high dimensionality of vision and the difficulty of discretizing concepts. The paper provides an introduction to VLMs, including how they work and how to train them, and discusses approaches to evaluating them. While the focus is on mapping images to language, the paper also touches o...
