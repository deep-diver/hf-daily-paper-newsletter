summary: This study presents Nash Mirror Prox (Nash-MP), an online algorithm for Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) that uses the Mirror Prox optimization scheme to quickly and reliably reach a Nash equilibrium. The algorithm's theoretical analysis shows it converges at a rate of order (1+2beta)^{-N/2} towards the beta-regularized Nash equilibrium, and it performs well in practical applications, such as fine-tuning large language models....
