summary: The authors present a new method for improving geometric understanding in large multimodal models by using hard negative contrastive learning. They train a model called MMGeoLM, which outperforms other open-source models and even competes with powerful closed-source models in geometric reasoning tasks. They also investigate the impact of different negative sample construction methods and the number of negative samples on the model's performance....
