summary: This study explores how to use large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed, experiment-ready scientific hypotheses, rather than just broad ideas. They propose a method that gradually builds hypotheses, step by step, and find that it works better than other approaches in creating hypotheses that are more likely to be true and experimentally feasible....
