summary: The researchers present a new framework, AdaCtrl, which adjusts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and allows users to control the budget for efficiency or effectiveness. This is achieved through a two-stage training process, and results show that AdaCtrl improves performance and reduces response length on various datasets, while also enabling user control over the reasoning budget....
