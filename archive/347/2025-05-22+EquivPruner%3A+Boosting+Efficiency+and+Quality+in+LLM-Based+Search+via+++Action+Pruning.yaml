summary: The study presents EquivPruner, a method that improves the efficiency and accuracy of search algorithms in large language models by identifying and eliminating redundant, semantically equivalent steps. This approach, tested on various models and tasks, significantly reduces token consumption and enhances reasoning performance, as demonstrated by a 48.1% token reduction and improved accuracy on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct model for the GSM8K task....
