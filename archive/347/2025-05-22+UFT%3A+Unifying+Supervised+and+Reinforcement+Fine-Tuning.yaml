summary: The study presents a new method called Unified Fine-Tuning (UFT) that combines supervised and reinforcement fine-tuning into one process for large language models. UFT improves reasoning abilities, outperforms existing methods, and reduces the sample complexity bottleneck, allowing for faster convergence on long-term tasks....
