summary: The authors propose a two-system architecture that uses reinforcement learning to balance the need for dense temporal coverage and high-resolution inputs in omnimodal models. The proposed framework, Omni-R1, outperforms other models in video-audio reasoning tasks and improves generalization and hallucination mitigation....
