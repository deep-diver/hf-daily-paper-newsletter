summary: DiffSplat is a 3D generative framework that leverages large-scale text-to-image diffusion models to create 3D Gaussian splats. It uses a lightweight reconstruction model for scalable dataset curation and introduces a 3D rendering loss to maintain 3D consistency across views, outperforming previous models in text- and image-conditioned generation tasks....
