summary: The paper proposes Gaussian Frosting, a mesh-based approach for real-time rendering and editing of complex 3D effects. It uses a layer of adaptive 3D Gaussians around a base mesh to better capture fine details and volumetric effects. The representation allows for efficient rendering and editing by modifying the base mesh, and outperforms existing surface-based approaches....
