summary: This paper introduces an image inversion method called ReNoise that enhances reconstruction accuracy without increasing the number of operations. ReNoise uses an iterative renoising mechanism to refine the approximation of a predicted point along the forward diffusion trajectory, and is evaluated using various sampling algorithms and models, showing its effectiveness in terms of both accuracy and speed....
