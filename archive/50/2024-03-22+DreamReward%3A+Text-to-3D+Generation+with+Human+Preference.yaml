summary: This paper presents DreamReward, a framework to improve text-to-3D models by learning from human preference feedback. It collects expert comparisons and builds Reward3D, a reward model to encode human preferences, and uses it to optimize the models with a direct tuning algorithm called DreamFL. DreamReward generates high-fidelity and consistent results that align better with human intention....
