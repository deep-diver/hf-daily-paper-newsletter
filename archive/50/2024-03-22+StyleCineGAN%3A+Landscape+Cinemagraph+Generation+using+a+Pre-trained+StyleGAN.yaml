summary: This paper presents a method called StyleCineGAN that can create cinemagraphs automatically from a still landscape image using a pre-trained StyleGAN. Unlike previous approaches, it leverages the deep feature space of the pre-trained model for both GAN inversion and cinemagraph generation. The proposed method, multi-scale deep feature warping (MSDFW), warps the intermediate features at different resolutions to generate high-resolution cinemagraphs with plausible looping animation. The method is ...
