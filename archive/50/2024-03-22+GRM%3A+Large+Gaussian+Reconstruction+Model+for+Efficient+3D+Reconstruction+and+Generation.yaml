summary: This paper introduces GRM, a fast and efficient 3D reconstruction model that can create 3D assets from sparse-view images in just 0.1 seconds. It uses a transformer architecture and 3D Gaussians to create a scalable and efficient framework, and it outperforms other methods in both quality and efficiency. GRM can also be used for generative tasks like turning text or images into 3D assets....
