summary: 'The authors propose a new method called Locality-aware Parallel Decoding to speed up the process of creating images one pixel at a time. They achieve this by introducing two main techniques: a flexible model for generating images in any order and a smart schedule for generating image patches that minimizes dependencies and maximizes support, resulting in significantly reduced generation steps and lower latency without sacrificing image quality....'
