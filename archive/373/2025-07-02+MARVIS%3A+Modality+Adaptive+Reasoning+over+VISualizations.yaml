summary: MARVIS is a training-free method that enables small vision-language models to accurately predict various data modalities, including vision, audio, biological, and tabular domains, using latent embedding spaces and spatial reasoning. It outperforms Gemini by 16% on average and approaches specialized methods without using PII or domain-specific training....
