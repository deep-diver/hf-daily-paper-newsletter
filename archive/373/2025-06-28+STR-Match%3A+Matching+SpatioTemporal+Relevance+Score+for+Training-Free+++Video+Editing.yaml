summary: The authors present a new algorithm called STR-Match for training-free video editing that creates visually appealing and consistent videos by calculating a relevance score for pixels in adjacent frames, which is done efficiently without using expensive 3D attention mechanisms. This approach ensures better temporal consistency and visual fidelity, even when making significant changes to the video, compared to existing methods....
