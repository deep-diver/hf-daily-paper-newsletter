summary: This paper introduces a new method called AdvPrompter that can quickly generate human-readable adversarial prompts to test the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs). The method is trained using a novel algorithm that does not require access to the gradients of the LLM being tested. Experimental results show that AdvPrompter is much faster than existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset. The method can also be used to make LLMs more robust against jai...
