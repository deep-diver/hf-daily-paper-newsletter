summary: This paper proposes a method for generating photorealistic materials for 3D meshes from text descriptions. Instead of relying on extensive paired data, it uses a pre-trained 2D diffusion model to connect the text and material graphs. The approach decomposes a shape into segments and synthesizes 2D images aligned with mesh parts, which are used to initialize material graph parameters and fine-tune them through differentiable rendering. Experiments show superior performance over existing methods i...
