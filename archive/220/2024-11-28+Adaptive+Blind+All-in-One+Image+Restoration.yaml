summary: The paper proposes an adaptive blind all-in-one restoration (ABAIR) model that can handle multiple degradations, generalize to unseen distortions, and adapt to new degradations by training a small fraction of parameters. The model is powerful in handling specific distortions and flexible in adapting to complex tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art and showing improved generalization to unseen degradations and composite distortions....
