summary: The paper presents SVIP, a dynamic draft length policy for speculative decoding systems that adapts the lengths of draft sequences based on the entropy of each draft token distribution. This approach improves the performance of existing SD methods, achieving up to 20% walltime speedup on SpecBench and 60% speedup on MT-Bench for long-form generation of up to 8K tokens. SVIP is training-free and compatible with any existing SD methods that generate draft tokens autoregressively, consistently impr...
