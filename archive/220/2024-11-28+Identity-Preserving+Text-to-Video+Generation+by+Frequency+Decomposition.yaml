summary: This paper introduces a new method for generating videos that keep the person's identity consistent, without needing to fine-tune the model for each case. It uses a frequency-aware heuristic identity-preserving DiT-based control scheme, and a hierarchical training strategy to leverage frequency information for identity preservation. The method is called ConsisID, and it generates high-quality, identity-preserving videos....
