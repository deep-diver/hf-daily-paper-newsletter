summary: A new evaluation framework called ISG is introduced to assess interleaved text-and-image generation. It uses a scene graph structure to evaluate responses on multiple levels of granularity. A benchmark called ISG-Bench is also introduced to evaluate models on complex language-vision tasks. The results show that unified vision-language models perform poorly, but compositional approaches show a 111% improvement at the holistic level. To facilitate future work, a baseline agent called ISG-Agent is ...
