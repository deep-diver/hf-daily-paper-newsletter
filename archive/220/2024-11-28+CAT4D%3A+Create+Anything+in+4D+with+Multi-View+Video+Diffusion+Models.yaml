summary: A method called CAT4D is introduced to create 4D scenes from monocular video by leveraging a multi-view video diffusion model trained on diverse datasets. This model can transform a single video into a multi-view video and enable 4D reconstruction via optimization of a deformable 3D Gaussian representation. CAT4D demonstrates competitive performance on benchmarks and has creative capabilities for 4D scene generation....
