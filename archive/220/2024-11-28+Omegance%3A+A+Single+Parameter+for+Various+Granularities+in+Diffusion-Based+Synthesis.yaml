summary: In this paper, we present a new method called Omegance, which uses a single parameter to control the level of detail in images and videos generated by diffusion models. This method does not require any changes to the model or additional computational resources, and it can be used to control the level of detail in specific regions or at specific points in time. The code for this method is available online....
