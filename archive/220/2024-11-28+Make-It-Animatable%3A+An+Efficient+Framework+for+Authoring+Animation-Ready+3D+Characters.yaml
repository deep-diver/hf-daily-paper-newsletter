summary: We have developed a new method called Make-It-Animatable that can make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second, regardless of its shape or pose. Our method generates high-quality blend weights, bones, and pose transformations and supports various 3D representations, including meshes and 3D Gaussian splats. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework, and our approach demonstrates significant improvements in both quali...
