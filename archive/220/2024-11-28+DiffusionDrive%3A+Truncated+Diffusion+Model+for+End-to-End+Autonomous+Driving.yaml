summary: We propose a new method called DiffusionDrive that uses a truncated diffusion model to generate driving actions for autonomous vehicles. This method reduces the number of denoising steps and improves the speed and diversity of the generated actions. It also includes an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for better interaction with the scene context. DiffusionDrive sets a new record on the NAVSIM dataset and runs at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090....
