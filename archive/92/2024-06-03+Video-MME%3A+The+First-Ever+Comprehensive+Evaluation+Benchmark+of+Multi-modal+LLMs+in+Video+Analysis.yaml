summary: The first-ever comprehensive evaluation benchmark of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in video analysis is introduced. This benchmark, named Video-MME, is designed to assess the performance of MLLMs in understanding video content across different visual domains, durations, data modalities, and annotation qualities. The experiments reveal that the Gemini 1.5 Pro model outperforms open-source models, highlighting the need for further improvements in handling longer sequences and multi-mod...
