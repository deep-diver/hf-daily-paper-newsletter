summary: Kaleido is a new method to improve the diversity of images generated by diffusion models by using autoregressive latent priors. It uses an autoregressive language model to generate latent variables that guide the image generation process. Kaleido can use different types of latent representations, such as textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens, to enhance the input conditions and generate more diverse outputs. The results show that Kaleido can broaden the ...
