summary: The proposed FFaceNeRF is a technique for face editing using Neural Radiance Fields, addressing the lack of user control in existing methods due to fixed mask layouts. It leverages a geometry adapter with feature injection and latent mixing for tri-plane augmentation, enabling rapid model adaptation to desired mask layouts and superior performance in flexibility, control, and image quality....
