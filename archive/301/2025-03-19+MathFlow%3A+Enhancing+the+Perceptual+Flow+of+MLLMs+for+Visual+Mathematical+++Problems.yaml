summary: The paper develops a new benchmark called FlowVerse to evaluate MLLMs' performance on visual mathematical problems, revealing limitations in extracting information from diagrams. The authors propose MathFlow, a modular pipeline that decouples perception and inference, and demonstrate significant performance gains when integrating MathFlow-P-7B, a dedicated perception model, with various inference models....
