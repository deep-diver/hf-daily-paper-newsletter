summary: "The authors present a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning approach, \textsc{FastCuRL}, to improve the training efficiency and performance of R1-like reasoning models. This method uses a context window extending strategy, which segments training data based on input prompt length and trains the model with progressively increasing context window length, resulting in better performance on complex reasoning tasks with long chain-of-thought rationales...."
