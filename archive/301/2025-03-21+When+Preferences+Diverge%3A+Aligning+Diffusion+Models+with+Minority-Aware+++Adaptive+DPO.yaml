summary: This study presents Adaptive-DPO, a novel approach to address the complexities in image generation tasks by handling minority samples in preference datasets. The method incorporates a minority-instance-aware metric into the DPO objective and introduces an Adaptive-DPO loss function to improve the DPO loss, thereby enhancing the model's learning of majority labels and mitigating the negative impact of minority samples....
