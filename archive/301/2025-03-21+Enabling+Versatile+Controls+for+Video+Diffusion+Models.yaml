summary: This research addresses the challenge of achieving precise and flexible control over fine-grained spatiotemporal attributes in text-to-video generation. The proposed VCtrl framework enables fine-grained control over pre-trained video diffusion models by integrating diverse user-specified control signals into the models without modifying the underlying generator, improving controllability and generation quality....
