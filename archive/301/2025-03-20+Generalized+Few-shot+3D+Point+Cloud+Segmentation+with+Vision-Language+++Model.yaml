summary: This study presents a novel framework for generalized few-shot 3D point cloud segmentation that combines the strengths of dense, noisy pseudo-labels from 3D vision-language models with precise, sparse few-shot samples. The proposed framework includes methods for filtering low-quality regions, adaptively labeling unlabeled areas, and embedding few-shot samples into training scenes for improved novel class learning, all while addressing the limited diversity in existing benchmarks....
