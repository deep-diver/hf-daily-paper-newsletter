summary: The paper proposes a method for reducing computational demands in vision encoders by identifying and retaining only the most informative visual tokens, using an autoencoder with a Gumbel-Softmax selection mechanism. Results show that more than 50% of visual context can be removed with minimal performance loss for OCR-based tasks, and even randomly retaining only 30% of tokens achieves comparable performance for general-domain tasks....
