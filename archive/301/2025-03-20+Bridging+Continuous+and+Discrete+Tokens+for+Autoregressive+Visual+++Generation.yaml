summary: The authors present TokenBridge, a method that combines the benefits of continuous and discrete tokens in autoregressive visual generation. It maintains the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens and the simplicity of discrete tokens by using post-training quantization and a dimension-wise quantization strategy. This method achieves high-quality visual generation with simple autoregressive modeling....
