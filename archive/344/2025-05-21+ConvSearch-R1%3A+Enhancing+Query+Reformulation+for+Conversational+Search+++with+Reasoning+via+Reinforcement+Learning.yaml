summary: The authors propose ConvSearch-R1, a new framework for improving query reformulation in conversational search systems by using reinforcement learning to eliminate the need for external supervision. This two-stage approach, which involves retrieval-guided self-distillation and a rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism, outperforms previous methods by over 10% on the TopiOCQA dataset using smaller models without external supervision....
