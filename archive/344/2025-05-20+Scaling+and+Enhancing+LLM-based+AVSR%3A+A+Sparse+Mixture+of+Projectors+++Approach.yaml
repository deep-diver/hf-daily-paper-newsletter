summary: The authors present Llama-SMoP, a new method for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition that uses a Sparse Mixture of Projectors approach to improve performance without increasing computational costs. This method allows for the use of smaller language models while maintaining strong performance, and the best configuration, Llama-SMoP DEDR, outperforms other models on various speech recognition tasks....
