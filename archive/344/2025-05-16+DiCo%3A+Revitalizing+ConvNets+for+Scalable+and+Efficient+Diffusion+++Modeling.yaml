summary: This study explores a more efficient alternative to the resource-intensive Diffusion Transformer for visual generation by revisiting convolution as a building block. The researchers develop Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a new family of diffusion models that outperform previous models in both image quality and generation speed, achieving significant efficiency gains by reducing channel redundancy with a compact channel attention mechanism....
