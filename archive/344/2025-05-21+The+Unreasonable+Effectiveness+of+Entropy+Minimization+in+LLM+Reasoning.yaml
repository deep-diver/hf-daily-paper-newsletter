summary: 'The paper explores how maximizing certainty in large language models'' outputs, without using labeled data, significantly boosts their performance on complex tasks like math, physics, and coding. Three methods are introduced: training the model to focus on its most confident predictions, using reinforcement learning to maximize certainty, and adjusting predictions at the time of inference to reduce uncertainty....'
