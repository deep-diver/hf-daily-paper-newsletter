summary: This study presents DeepTravel, a framework for creating autonomous travel planning agents that can plan, execute, and learn from their actions without relying on fixed prompts or external API constraints. The framework uses a sandbox environment, hierarchical reward modeling, and a reply augmented reinforcement learning method to enable small language models to outperform larger ones in travel planning tasks....
