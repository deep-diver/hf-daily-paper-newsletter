summary: The researchers propose a new method called Cache-to-Cache (C2C) that allows large language models to communicate directly with each other using their internal representations, improving response quality and reducing latency compared to text-based communication. Experiments show that C2C outperforms individual models by 8.5-10.5% and text communication by 3.0-5.0%, while also being 2.0 times faster....
