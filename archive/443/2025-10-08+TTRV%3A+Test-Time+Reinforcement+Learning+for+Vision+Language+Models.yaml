summary: This study presents a new method, TTRV, for improving vision language models by adapting them in real-time during use, without requiring labeled data. The approach enhances the GRPO framework, rewards the model based on output frequency, and reduces output uncertainty, leading to significant improvements in object recognition and visual question answering tasks, even outperforming GPT-4o in some cases....
