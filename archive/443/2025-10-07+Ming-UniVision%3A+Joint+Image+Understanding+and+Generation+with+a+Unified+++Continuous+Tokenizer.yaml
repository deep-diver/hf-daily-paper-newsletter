summary: The study presents MingTok, a new visual tokenizer that uses a continuous latent space to unify visual understanding and generation, addressing the challenge of quantization errors in existing methods. Ming-UniVision, built on MingTok, eliminates the need for task-specific visual representations and supports multi-round, in-context tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both understanding and generation tasks....
