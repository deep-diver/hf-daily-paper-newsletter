summary: This paper proposes DARAG, a novel approach to improve Generative Error Correction for ASR by augmenting the training dataset with synthetic data and introducing retrieval-augmented correction to better handle named entities. The approach is simple, scalable, and applicable across different domains and languages, achieving significant WER improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios....
