summary: The paper proposes an efficient method called gamma-MoD to reduce the computational cost of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) without significantly impacting their performance. The method involves identifying and replacing redundant layers with a mixture of depths (MoD) layer, guided by the attention rank (ARank). Experimental results show that gamma-MoD can reduce the training and inference time of MLLMs by up to 31.0% and 53.2%, respectively, while maintaining performance on various ben...
