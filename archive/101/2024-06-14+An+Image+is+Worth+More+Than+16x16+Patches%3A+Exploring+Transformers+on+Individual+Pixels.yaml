summary: 'This paper presents an interesting finding that questions the necessity of locality in modern computer vision architectures. They find that vanilla Transformers can operate by directly treating each individual pixel as a token and achieve highly performant results, which is substantially different from the popular design in Vision Transformer. They showcase the effectiveness of pixels-as-tokens across three well-studied tasks in computer vision: supervised learning for object classification, sel...'
