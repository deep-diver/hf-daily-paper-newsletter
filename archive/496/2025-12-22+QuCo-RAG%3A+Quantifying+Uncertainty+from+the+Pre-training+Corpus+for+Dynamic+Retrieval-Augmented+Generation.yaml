summary: The authors present a new method called QuCo-RAG that reduces hallucinations in large language models by using objective statistics from pre-training data instead of relying on the model's internal signals. This approach identifies knowledge gaps and verifies entity co-occurrence, triggering retrieval when uncertainty is high, and has shown significant improvements in various benchmarks and models....
