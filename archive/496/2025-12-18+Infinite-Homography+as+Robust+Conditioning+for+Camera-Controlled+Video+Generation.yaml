summary: The study presents InfCam, a new method for generating high-quality, camera-controlled videos without relying on depth estimation. It uses infinite homography warping to encode camera movements directly into the video's latent space, ensuring accurate camera poses and high visual fidelity, and it improves upon existing methods by using a data augmentation pipeline to create diverse training datasets....
