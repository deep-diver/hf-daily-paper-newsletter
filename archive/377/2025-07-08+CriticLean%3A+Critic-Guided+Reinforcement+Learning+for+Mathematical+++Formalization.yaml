summary: The authors present CriticLean, a new framework that improves the critic phase in automated theorem proving by actively involving the critic in learning. They introduce CriticLeanGPT for assessing formalization accuracy and CriticLeanBench for evaluating models, demonstrating significant improvements over existing baselines. They also create FineLeanCorpus, a diverse dataset of over 285K problems for further research in formal mathematical reasoning....
