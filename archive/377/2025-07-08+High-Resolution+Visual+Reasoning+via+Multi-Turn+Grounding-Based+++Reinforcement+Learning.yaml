summary: The authors present a new method called MGPO that helps large multi-modal models focus on important parts of high-resolution images by automatically cropping and using a multi-turn conversation framework. Experiments show that this method improves the models' performance on various tasks without needing extra annotations, and it even outperforms other popular models on challenging tasks....
