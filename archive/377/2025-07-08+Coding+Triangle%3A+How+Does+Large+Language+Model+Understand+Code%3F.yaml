summary: The study introduces a framework called Code Triangle to assess large language models' programming skills by analyzing their ability to edit code, implement solutions, and generate test cases. Experiments show that while LLMs can form consistent systems, they often lack the diversity and robustness of human programmers, and their errors tend to cluster due to biases in training data. The research suggests that improving LLMs' performance and robustness can be achieved by incorporating human-gene...
