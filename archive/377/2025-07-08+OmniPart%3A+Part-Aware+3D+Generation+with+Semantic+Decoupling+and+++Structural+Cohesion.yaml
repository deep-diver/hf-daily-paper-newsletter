summary: 'The paper presents a new method, OmniPart, for creating 3D objects with clear, editable parts, which is useful for interactive applications. OmniPart separates the task into two parts: first, it generates a controllable sequence of 3D part bounding boxes guided by 2D part masks, and second, it uses a pre-trained 3D generator to create all 3D parts within the planned layout, allowing for user-defined part granularity and precise localization....'
