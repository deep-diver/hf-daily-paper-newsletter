summary: UltrAvatar is a novel 3D avatar generation approach that employs a diffuse
  color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model to overcome

  generation methods. The former removes unwanted lighting effects to reveal true
  diffuse colors, while the latter generates PBR textures with two gradient-based
  guidances to render face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh
  geometry. The p...
