summary: This paper introduces a new 3D generative model called Make-A-Shape that
  uses a wavelet-tree representation for efficient training on large scale, utilizing
  10 million public shapes. The representation is made generatable by a diffusion
  model and can generate shapes from various modalities. The approach outperforms
  state-of-the-art in quality and generates shapes within seconds. The model is trained
  using a subband adaptive strategy, which enables it to learn to generate both coarse
  and detail w...
