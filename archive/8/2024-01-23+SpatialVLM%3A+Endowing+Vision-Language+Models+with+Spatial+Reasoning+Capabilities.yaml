summary: This paper proposes a system to endow Vision Language Models (VLMs) with
  spatial reasoning capabilities by training them with internet-scale spatial reasoning
  data generated by an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework. The authors
  aim to address the VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability by focusing on 3D
  spatial knowledge in training data and enhancing their ability on both qualitative
  and quantitative spatial VQA. By training a VLM on such data, the authors unlock
  novel applic...
