summary: The paper introduces the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT) which is
  an image generative model that can scale to high-resolution (e.g. 1024x1024) directly
  in pixel-space. It uses the Transformer architecture to bridge the gap between the
  efficiency of convolutional U-Nets and the scalability of Transformers. HDiT successfully
  trains without typical high-resolution training techniques and performs competitively
  with existing models on ImageNet 256^2, setting a new state-of-the-art for diffusi...
