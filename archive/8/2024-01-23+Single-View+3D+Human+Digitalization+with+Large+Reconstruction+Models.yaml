summary: This paper introduces Human-LRM, a single-stage feed-forward Large Reconstruction
  Model that predicts human Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from a single image. They
  propose a strategy to enhance the model's applicability for in-the-wild scenarios
  with occlusions by distilling multi-view reconstruction into single-view via a conditional
  triplane diffusion model. Human-LRM significantly outperforms previous methods on
  several benchmarks....
