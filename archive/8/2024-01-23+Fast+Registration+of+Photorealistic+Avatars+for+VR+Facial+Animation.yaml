summary: 'This paper proposes a novel system for fast registration of photorealistic
  avatars for VR facial animation. The system decouples the problem into two parts:
  an iterative refinement module that takes in-domain inputs and a generic avatar-guided
  image-to-image style transfer module that is conditioned on current estimation of
  expression and head pose. The approach produces high-quality results efficiently
  and validates the accuracy and efficiency through experiments on a commodity headset,
