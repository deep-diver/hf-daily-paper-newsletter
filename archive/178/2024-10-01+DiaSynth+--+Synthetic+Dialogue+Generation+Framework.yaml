summary: The paper presents DiaSynth, a framework that generates synthetic dialogues for various domains using Large Language Models (LLMs) with Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. The framework creates contextually rich, domain-specific dialogues that mimic natural human interactions and can be used as an alternative to traditional data collection methods. The study shows that pretrained language models fine-tuned on synthetic data outperform base models by 16.47% and capture 90.48% of the distribution of...
