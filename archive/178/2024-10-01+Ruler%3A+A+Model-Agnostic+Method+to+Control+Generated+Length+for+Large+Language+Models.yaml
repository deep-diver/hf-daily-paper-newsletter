summary: We propose a method called Ruler to control the length of responses generated by large language models. Ruler uses Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of these models under length-constrained instructions. Experiments show that Ruler is effective across different models on the Target Length Generation Task, with an average gain of 27.97 on Precise Match and 29.57 on Flexible Match....
