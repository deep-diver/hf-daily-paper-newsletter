summary: The authors present a new method called FLARE that improves the efficiency of self-attention mechanisms, enabling them to handle larger datasets while maintaining high accuracy. This is achieved by projecting input sequences onto a fixed-length latent sequence, which allows for a low-rank form of attention that can be applied more quickly. Additionally, the authors introduce a new dataset for additive manufacturing research and provide their code for others to use....
