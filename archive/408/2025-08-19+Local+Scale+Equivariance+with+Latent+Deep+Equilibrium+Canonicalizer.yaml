summary: This study presents a method named Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer (DEC) to enhance a model's ability to handle changes in object size within images, which is a common issue in computer vision. The proposed DEC can be easily added to existing models and has been shown to improve performance and consistency on the ImageNet benchmark for four popular pre-trained models....
