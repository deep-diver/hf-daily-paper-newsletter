summary: The study presents a new framework called REARM to improve multi-modal recommendation systems by addressing limitations in current methods. REARM enhances contrastive learning using meta-network and orthogonal constraint strategies, and integrates user interest and item co-occurrence graphs for better homography relations, resulting in superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines....
