summary: The paper presents AlignVLM, a novel method to align visual features with language embeddings in vision-language models. AlignVLM uses a weighted average of LLM text embeddings, which leverages linguistic priors to ensure visual features are mapped to regions of the space that the LLM can interpret effectively....
