summary: The paper introduces a reasoning challenge based on the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge for large language models, which tests general knowledge. The challenge reveals capability gaps not evident in existing benchmarks, showing that OpenAI o1 outperforms other models on specialized knowledge tests, and highlights new kinds of failures in reasoning outputs, such as DeepSeek R1 conceding with 'I give up' before providing a wrong answer or being 'uncertain' in its output....
