summary: The paper examines the causes of significant model degradation when performing large-scale sequential editing in prior knowledge editing research. It then introduces ENCORE, an early stopping and norm-constrained robust editing method that helps mitigate overfitting and disproportionate norm growth, allowing for up to 10,000 sequential edits without losing downstream performance and is faster than MEMIT and AlphaEdit....
