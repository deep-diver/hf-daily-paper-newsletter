summary: The paper evaluates the robustness of ten pathology foundation models to variations between medical centers. It introduces a novel robustness metric, the Robustness Index, which measures the dominance of biological features over confounding features. The study finds that all models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree, with only one model having a robustness index greater than one, but only slightly. The paper also analyzes the impact of unrobustness on classification perfor...
