summary: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) improve language model alignment by optimizing policy directly instead of using RL and RM in RLHF. DAAs can be categorized by ranking losses, rewards, and whether a Supervised Fine-Tuning phase is needed. This paper compares DAAs, improves single-stage methods with explicit SFT phases and a beta parameter, and shows that using pairwise or pointwise objectives is more important than specific reward or loss functions....
