summary: This research study investigates the issue of conflicting targets in unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding, and proposes a new approach called Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss. The AIA loss aims to mitigate task conflicts without model decoupling by learning task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, which has been shown to improve both generation and understanding performance in various models....
