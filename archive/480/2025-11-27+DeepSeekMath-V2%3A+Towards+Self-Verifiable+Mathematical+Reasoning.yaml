summary: The study introduces DeepSeekMath-V2, a model that aims to improve AI's mathematical reasoning by focusing on self-verification and rigorous step-by-step derivation, which is particularly important for tasks like theorem proving and scaling test-time compute. The model is trained using an accurate and faithful verifier and a proof generator, which work together to identify and resolve issues in the proofs, resulting in strong theorem-proving capabilities and high scores on various mathematical c...
