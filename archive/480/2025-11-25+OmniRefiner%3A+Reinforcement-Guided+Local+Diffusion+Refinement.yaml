summary: The authors present a new framework called OmniRefiner that improves the preservation of fine details in reference-guided image generation. This is achieved by using a two-stage process that first adapts a single-image diffusion editor and then applies reinforcement learning to enhance localized editing capability, resulting in more accurate and visually consistent edits compared to existing models....
