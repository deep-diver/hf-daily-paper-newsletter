summary: This study reveals that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, the key factor for few-step distillation is not matching the student's output with the teacher's, but a previously unnoticed component called CFG Augmentation. The researchers also found that another component, Distribution Matching, acts as a stabilizing force during training. By understanding these two aspects separately, the study proposes new methods to improve the distillation process and has already been applied in a t...
