summary: The study presents a large-scale model called Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT) that efficiently translates data by modeling the trajectory between inputs and outputs, unlike traditional models. By scaling this Transformer-based model to 20B and 1.3B parameters, the authors demonstrate its effectiveness for image and video translation tasks, including instruction-based image editing and complex video translation....
