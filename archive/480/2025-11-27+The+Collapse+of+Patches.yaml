summary: The study explores how observing certain image patches reduces uncertainty in other patches, similar to quantum mechanics' wave function collapse. They developed an autoencoder to identify crucial patches for image reconstruction, leading to improved image generation and classification methods, and introduced patch collapse as a new perspective for efficient image modeling....
