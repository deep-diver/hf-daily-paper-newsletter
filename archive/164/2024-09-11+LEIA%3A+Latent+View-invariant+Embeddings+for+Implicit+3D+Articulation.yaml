summary: LEIA is a new method for representing dynamic 3D objects by observing the object at different times and using a hypernetwork to parameterize a NeRF. This allows for learning a view-invariant latent representation for each state, and interpolating between states to generate new articulation configurations in 3D space. LEIA outperforms previous methods that rely on motion information for articulation registration....
