summary: We present LLaMA-Omni, a model that allows for real-time interaction with large language models via speech, eliminating the need for speech transcription. It's based on the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model and a new dataset called InstructS2S-200K. LLaMA-Omni provides better responses and low latency, making it a promising approach for speech-language models in the future....
