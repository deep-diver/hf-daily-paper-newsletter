summary: The study finds that a common method for improving diffusion models, called Classifier-free Guidance, often produces suboptimal results, leading to lower quality outputs. The researchers then propose a new method, S^2-Guidance, which uses random selection of model parts to avoid these suboptimal predictions and improve output quality, outperforming the old method in various tasks....
