summary: The authors create a new method called 4DNeX, which uses a pretrained video model to generate dynamic 3D scenes from a single image more efficiently than existing methods. They also build a large dataset with high-quality 4D annotations and propose strategies to adapt pretrained models for 4D modeling, resulting in high-quality dynamic point clouds for novel-view video synthesis....
