summary: The study presents a new method called Unilogit for selectively forgetting specific information in Large Language Models while preserving their overall utility. Unilogit dynamically adjusts target logits to achieve a uniform probability for the target token, improving the model's ability to approximate the golden targets and outperforming existing methods in extensive experiments....
