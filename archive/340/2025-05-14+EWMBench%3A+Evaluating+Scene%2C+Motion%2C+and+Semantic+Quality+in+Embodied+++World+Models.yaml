summary: The study presents a new evaluation framework, EWMBench, for embodied world models (EWMs) which generate physically plausible scenes from language commands. EWMBench assesses EWMs based on visual scene consistency, motion correctness, and semantic alignment, using a curated dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation toolkit to identify current models' limitations and guide future advancements....
