summary: 'This study introduces a method to create detailed and accurate depth maps for any scene by combining precise depth measurements with complete geometric structures. The proposed approach uses a two-step process: first, it fills in diverse metric priors using depth prediction and then refines the noise in depth priors using a conditioned monocular depth estimation model. The model demonstrates excellent performance across various tasks and datasets, and it can adapt to advancements in monocular de...'
