summary: This research introduces a novel system called AAD-LLM that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention in auditory scenes, improving the alignment of responses with listener intention. The model, which extends an auditory LLM, predicts the attended speaker from neural activity and conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state, showing improved performance in various tasks compared to existing models....
