summary: SWE-RL is a reinforcement learning approach that enhances LLM reasoning for real-world software engineering tasks using a lightweight rule-based reward. Trained on Llama 3, Llama3-SWE-RL-70B achieves a 41.0% solve rate on SWE-bench Verified and outperforms other medium-sized LLMs, even demonstrating generalized reasoning skills on out-of-domain tasks....
