summary: The paper presents KV-Edit, a training-free method that uses the KV cache in Dense Image Transformers (DiTs) to maintain background consistency in image editing tasks. It eliminates the need for complex mechanisms or expensive training by preserving background tokens, making it compatible with any DiT-based generative model. The approach demonstrates superior performance in background and image quality compared to existing methods, even outperforming training-based techniques....
