summary: The study presents InfGen, a new method for generating images at any resolution from a fixed-sized latent, which significantly reduces computation time for high-resolution images. By replacing the VAE decoder with a new generator, InfGen allows for faster and more efficient image synthesis without the need for retraining diffusion models....
