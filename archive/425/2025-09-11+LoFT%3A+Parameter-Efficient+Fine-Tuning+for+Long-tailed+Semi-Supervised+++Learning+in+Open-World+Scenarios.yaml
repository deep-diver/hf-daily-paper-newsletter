summary: The study presents LoFT, a new framework for efficient fine-tuning in long-tailed semi-supervised learning, which improves upon existing methods by using foundation models to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. Additionally, the researchers introduce LoFT-OW to handle out-of-distribution samples in open-world scenarios, achieving better performance than previous approaches with only 1% of the unlabeled data....
