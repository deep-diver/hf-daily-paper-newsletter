summary: 'This study explores two methods for predicting annotator-specific annotations: in-context learning with large language models and label distribution learning with RoBERTa. The research finds that in-context learning can effectively generate perspective-based annotations, and combining these predictions improves performance, while label distribution learning shows potential for soft label predictions and suggests further investigation by the perspectivist community....'
