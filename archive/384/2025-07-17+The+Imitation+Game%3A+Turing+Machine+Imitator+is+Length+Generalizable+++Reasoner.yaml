summary: This study presents a new method called Turing Machine Imitation Learning (TAIL) that enhances the problem-solving ability of large language models for longer sequences. TAIL improves performance on various tasks by mimicking the steps of a Turing Machine, and it outperforms previous methods in experiments with a synthetic dataset....
