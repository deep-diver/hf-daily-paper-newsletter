summary: 'This study presents a new method called RiemannLoRA that tackles two main issues in LoRA optimization for large language models: overparametrization and initialization. By viewing LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold, RiemannLoRA eliminates overparametrization and finds the best initial direction for loss reduction. The method is efficient and stable, and experiments show that it outperforms standard LoRA and other advanced variations in terms of speed and performance....'
