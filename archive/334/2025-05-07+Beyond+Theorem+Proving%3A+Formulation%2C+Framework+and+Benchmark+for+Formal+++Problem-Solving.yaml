summary: The authors propose a new approach to problem-solving by formulating it as a deterministic Markov decision process and introduce a novel framework called FPS that uses formal theorem proving environments for process-verified problem-solving. They also present three benchmarks for evaluating the performance of problem-solving models and propose a symbolic approach to determine the correctness of answers through formal verification....
