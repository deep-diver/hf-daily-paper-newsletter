summary: The authors present a new framework called RAIL to improve 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT scans using semi-supervised learning. RAIL addresses issues with limited supervision in ambiguous regions and unreliable pseudo-labels by introducing two instructive mechanisms, Disagreement-Focused Supervision and Confidence-Aware Learning, which enhance the model's performance and reliability with minimal annotation....
