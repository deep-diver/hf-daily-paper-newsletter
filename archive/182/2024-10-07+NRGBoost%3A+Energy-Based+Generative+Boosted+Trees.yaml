summary: This paper introduces an energy-based generative boosting algorithm that is similar to the second order boosting used in XGBoost. It can handle discriminative tasks on tabular data and is also capable of sampling. The algorithm achieves similar performance to GBDT while outperforming alternative generative approaches....
