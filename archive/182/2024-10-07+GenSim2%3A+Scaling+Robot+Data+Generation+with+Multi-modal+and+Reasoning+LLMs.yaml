summary: This paper introduces GenSim2, a framework that uses LLMs to create complex and realistic simulation tasks, including long-horizon tasks with articulated objects. It also proposes planning and RL solvers to automatically generate demonstration data at scale. The paper suggests a multi-task language-conditioned policy architecture called PPT that learns from the generated demonstrations and exhibits strong sim-to-real zero-shot transfer. By combining the proposed pipeline and policy architecture,...
