summary: CANVAS is a new way for robots to understand and follow abstract instructions from humans, like verbal commands or rough sketches. It uses imitation learning to learn from human navigation behavior and outperforms other systems in various environments, even with noisy instructions. It also aligns with human demonstrations and commonsense constraints, and can be used in real-world applications with impressive results....
