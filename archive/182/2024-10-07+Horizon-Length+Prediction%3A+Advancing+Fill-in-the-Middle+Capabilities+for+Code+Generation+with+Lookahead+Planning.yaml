summary: We propose a new training objective called Horizon-Length Prediction (HLP) to improve the performance of code language models in generating missing code given both left and right contexts. HLP teaches models to predict the number of remaining middle tokens at each step, allowing them to inherently learn infilling boundaries without relying on dataset-specific post-processing. Our evaluation shows that HLP significantly improves Fill-in-the-Middle performance and boosts model performance on code ...
