summary: The paper introduces a new sandbox suite for integrated data-model co-development in multi-modal generative models. The suite provides a comprehensive platform for rapid iteration and refinement of both data and models, leading to significant performance boosts. The authors also uncover valuable insights into the relationship between data quality, diversity, and model behavior. The codes, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/blob/main/docs/Sandbox.md....
