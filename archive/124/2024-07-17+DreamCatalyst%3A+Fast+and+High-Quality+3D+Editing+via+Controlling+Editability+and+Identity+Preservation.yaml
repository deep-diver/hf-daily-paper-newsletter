summary: 'DreamCatalyst is a new framework that improves the quality and speed of 3D editing. It does this by considering the sampling dynamics of diffusion models during the editing process. DreamCatalyst has two modes: a faster mode that edits a NeRF scene in about 25 minutes, and a high-quality mode that produces better results in less than 70 minutes. The high-quality mode is faster and produces better results than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods. You can see more results on the project ...'
