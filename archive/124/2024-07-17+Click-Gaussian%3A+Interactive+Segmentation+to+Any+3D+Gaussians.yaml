summary: Our paper presents Click-Gaussian, a method for real-time 3D Gaussian segmentation that overcomes the limitations of current methods by learning distinguishable features and using Global Feature-guided Learning (GFL) to smooth out noise. Our method is up to 130 times faster and more accurate than previous methods....
