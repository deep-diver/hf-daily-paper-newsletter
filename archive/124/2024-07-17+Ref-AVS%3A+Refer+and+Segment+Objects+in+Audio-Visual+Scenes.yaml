summary: This paper proposes a new task called Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) which involves segmenting objects within visual scenes based on expressions containing multimodal cues. The paper also introduces a new method that uses multimodal cues to provide precise segmentation guidance and constructs the first Ref-AVS benchmark. The results show that the proposed method is effective in precisely segmenting objects using multimodal-cue expressions....
