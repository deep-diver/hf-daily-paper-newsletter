summary: This paper introduces a method for manipulating the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) by embedding a backdoor in them. The backdoor can cause the model's output probability distribution to converge towards an attacker-predefined distribution without changing the top-1 prediction. The attack is successful in multiple-choice questions and can generalize across different prompts and domains. This work highlights a significant threat to the reliability of LLMs and underscores the need for ...
