summary: This study investigates the challenges in language model reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the sensitivity to implementation choices and the lack of transparency in evaluations. The authors propose a standardized evaluation framework and find that supervised finetuning methods show stronger generalization compared to reinforcement learning approaches, which are prone to overfitting....
