summary: We present XLand-100B, a large-scale dataset for in-context reinforcement learning, to address the lack of challenging benchmarks in the field. It contains 100B transitions and 2.5B episodes, collected over 50,000 GPU hours. The dataset and utilities are open-source and available under Apache 2.0 licence at https://github.com/dunno-lab/xland-minigrid-datasets, aiming to democratize research in the field and provide a solid foundation for further scaling....
