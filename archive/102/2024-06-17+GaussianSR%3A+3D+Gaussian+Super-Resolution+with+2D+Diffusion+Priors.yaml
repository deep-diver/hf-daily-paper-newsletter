summary: GaussianSR is a method that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D diffusion priors to improve the quality of novel view synthesis from low-resolution input views. It reduces stochastic disturbances by shrinking the range of diffusion timestep and discarding redundant Gaussian primitives. The method produces high-quality results on both synthetic and real-world datasets....
