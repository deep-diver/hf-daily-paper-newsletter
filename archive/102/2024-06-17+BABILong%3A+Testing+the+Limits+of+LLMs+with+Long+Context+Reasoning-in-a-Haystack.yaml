summary: BABILong benchmark is introduced to evaluate large language models' performance in long context reasoning. It includes 20 tasks and tests models' ability to process facts scattered across long natural text. Evaluations show that popular LLMs utilize only 10-20% of the context and their performance declines with increased complexity. Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods achieve 60% accuracy on single-fact question answering, while recurrent memory transformers enable processing of up to 11 mill...
