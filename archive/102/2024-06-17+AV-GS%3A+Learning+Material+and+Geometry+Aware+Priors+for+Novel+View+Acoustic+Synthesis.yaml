summary: The paper presents a new method called AV-GS for creating binaural audio in a 3D scene. This method uses a point-based scene representation and an audio-guidance parameter to better understand the scene's environment, including room geometry and material properties. The method also uses a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points for sound propagation. Experiments show that AV-GS outperforms existing methods on real-world and simulation-based datasets....
