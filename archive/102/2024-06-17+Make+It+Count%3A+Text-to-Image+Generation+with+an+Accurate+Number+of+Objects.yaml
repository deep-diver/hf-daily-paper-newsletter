summary: We propose CountGen, a method for text-to-image generation that ensures the correct number of objects are depicted. This is achieved by identifying features within the diffusion model that carry object identity information, and using them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process. CountGen also detects over-generation and under-generation, and fixes the latter by training a model to predict the shape and location of a missing object based on the layout of existing o...
