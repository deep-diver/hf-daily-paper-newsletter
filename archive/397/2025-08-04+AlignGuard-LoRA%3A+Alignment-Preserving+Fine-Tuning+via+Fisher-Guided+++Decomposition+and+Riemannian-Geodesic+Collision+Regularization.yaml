summary: The authors present a new method called AlignGuard-LoRA that helps maintain the safety and behavioral constraints of large language models during fine-tuning. This approach uses various techniques, such as Fisher Information Matrix-based regularization and collision-aware regularization, to minimize alignment drift and ensure that new knowledge is integrated without weakening existing safety features....
