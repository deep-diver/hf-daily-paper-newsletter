summary: The study presents ToolTrain, a two-stage training framework that uses supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to improve language models in locating code issues by utilizing repository retrieval tools. Experimental results show that ToolTrain-trained models outperform state-of-the-art models, including Claude-3.7, in function-level localization and end-to-end issue resolution....
