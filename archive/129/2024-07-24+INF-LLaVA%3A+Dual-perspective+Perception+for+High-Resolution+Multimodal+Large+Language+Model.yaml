summary: INF-LLaVA is a new type of MLLM that can process high-resolution images by capturing detailed local information and comprehensive global context. It uses a Dual-perspective Cropping Module (DCM) to ensure each sub-image contains local and global details, and a Dual-perspective Enhancement Module (DEM) to allow sub-images to interact and enhance each other. INF-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLMs and the code and pretrained model are available online....
