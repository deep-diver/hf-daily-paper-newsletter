summary: This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to improve the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs) used in medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a sequence of steps that mimics a doctor's thought process and provides a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution, making model diagnostics controllable and aiding in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry. The study developed DiagnosisGPT, a model capable of d...
