summary: Cross Anything System (CAS) is a new system that helps quadruped robots navigate through complex terrains. It uses a high-level reasoning module and a low-level control policy. The high-level module uses a vision-language model and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. The low-level module uses probability annealing selection and reinforcement learning. CAS can navigate well across various terrains and is useful in many indoor and outdoor scenarios....
