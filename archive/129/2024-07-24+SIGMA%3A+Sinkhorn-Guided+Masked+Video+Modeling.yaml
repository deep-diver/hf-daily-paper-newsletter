summary: SIGMA is a video pretraining method that learns video models and a target feature space using a projection network. It distributes features of space-time tubes evenly across a limited number of learnable clusters and infuses semantic and temporal meaning into the feature space. Experimental results show that SIGMA improves video representation learning compared to previous methods....
