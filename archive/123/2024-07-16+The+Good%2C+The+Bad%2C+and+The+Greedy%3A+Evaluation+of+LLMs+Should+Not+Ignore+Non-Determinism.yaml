summary: This paper investigates the impact of non-determinism on large language models (LLMs) and how it affects performance in real-world applications. The study compares greedy decoding and sampling, examines benchmark consistency, and explores unique model behaviors. The results show that greedy decoding generally outperforms sampling methods and that smaller LLMs can perform as well as or better than larger models like GPT-4-Turbo. The research emphasizes the importance of considering non-determinis...
