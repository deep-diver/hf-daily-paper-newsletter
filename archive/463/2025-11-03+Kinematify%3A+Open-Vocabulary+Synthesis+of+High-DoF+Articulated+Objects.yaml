summary: Kinematify is a new framework that creates detailed 3D models of complex, moveable objects from simple images or text descriptions, without relying on previous motion data or assumptions. This tool is particularly useful for robotics, as it enables more accurate and efficient manipulation of objects with many moving parts by automatically inferring their structures and joint parameters....
