summary: The authors present STAR-Bench, a new benchmark for testing audio 4D intelligence, which focuses on reasoning about sound dynamics in time and 3D space. They demonstrate that STAR-Bench effectively identifies gaps in current models' ability to understand fine-grained perceptual reasoning, compared to human performance, and can help guide future improvements in this area....
