summary: The study presents FALCON, a new approach that improves vision-language-action models by incorporating detailed 3D spatial information, which helps in better spatial understanding and adaptability. FALCON uses spatial foundation models to provide strong geometric priors and can optionally integrate depth or pose data without requiring any changes to its architecture, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in various simulations and real-world tasks....
