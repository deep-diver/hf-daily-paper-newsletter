summary: The study presents GRPO-Guard, a method that improves GRPO-based reinforcement learning for flow-matching models. It addresses the issue of implicit over-optimization by restoring a balanced importance ratio and equalizing policy gradients, leading to better model performance without relying on heavy KL regularization....
