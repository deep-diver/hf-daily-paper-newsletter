summary: The authors present a new framework called Optimize Any Topology (OAT) that can quickly and accurately design structures for various engineering applications, even in complex shapes and sizes. OAT uses advanced machine learning techniques and a large dataset of optimized structures to predict the best design for specific requirements, significantly outperforming existing methods and enabling fast, resolution-free design optimization....
