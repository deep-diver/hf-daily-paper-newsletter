summary: The study focuses on estimating uncertainty for anatomical landmark-based segmentation in chest X-rays, using a hybrid neural network architecture. They introduce two uncertainty measures and release a large-scale dataset, CheXmask-U, to help researchers improve the robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray imaging....
