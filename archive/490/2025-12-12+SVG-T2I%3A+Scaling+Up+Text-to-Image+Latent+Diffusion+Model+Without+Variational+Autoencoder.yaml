summary: The study presents SVG-T2I, a method that enables high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the Visual Foundation Model (VFM) feature domain, without using a Variational Autoencoder. By utilizing a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I demonstrates competitive performance and makes the project fully open-source to promote further research in representation-driven visual generation....
