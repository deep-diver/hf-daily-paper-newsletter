summary: The study presents a new framework called MetaCanvas that enables multimodal large language models to directly reason and plan in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces for image and video generation. By implementing MetaCanvas on various diffusion backbones and evaluating it across multiple tasks, the researchers demonstrate its superior performance compared to global-conditioning baselines, suggesting a promising approach for improving the precision and control of multimodal generation....
