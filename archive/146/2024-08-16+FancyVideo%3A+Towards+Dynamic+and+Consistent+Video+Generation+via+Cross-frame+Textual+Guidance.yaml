summary: 'This paper introduces FancyVideo, a new video generation model that improves the text-control mechanism by using frame-specific textual guidance. This is achieved through the Cross-frame Textual Guidance Module (CTGM), which has three components: Temporal Information Injector (TII), Temporal Affinity Refiner (TAR), and Temporal Feature Booster (TFB). These components work together to improve the model''s ability to understand the temporal logic in prompts and generate videos with coherent motion....'
