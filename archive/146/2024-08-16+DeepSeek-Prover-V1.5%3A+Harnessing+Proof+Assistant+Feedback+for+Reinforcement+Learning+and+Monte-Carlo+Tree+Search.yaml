summary: DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 is a new theorem proving model that uses AI to help find mathematical proofs. It's designed to work with Lean 4 and has been trained on a special dataset of formal mathematical proofs. The model uses reinforcement learning to improve its performance and has achieved new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks....
