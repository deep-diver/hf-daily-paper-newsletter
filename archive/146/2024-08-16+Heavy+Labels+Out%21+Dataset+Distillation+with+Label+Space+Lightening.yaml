summary: We propose a method called HeLlO to reduce the storage required for large-scale training datasets by generating synthetic labels directly from synthetic images using a label-lightening framework. Our method achieves similar performance to current state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods while only requiring 0.003% of the original storage for soft labels....
