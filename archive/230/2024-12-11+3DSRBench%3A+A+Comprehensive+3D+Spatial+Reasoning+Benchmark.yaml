summary: This paper introduces 3DSRBench, a benchmark for evaluating the 3D spatial reasoning abilities of large multi-modal models. The benchmark includes 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types and two subsets with paired images that have common and uncommon viewpoints. The paper benchmarks a variety of LMMs and finds that they have limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as degrade...
