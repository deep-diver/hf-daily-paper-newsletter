summary: We developed a new method called Generative Densification to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions created by feed-forward models. This method uses the information learned from these models to create more detailed and accurate 3D images. Our method is efficient and can work well in different situations, outperforming other methods while using similar or smaller amounts of computer resources....
