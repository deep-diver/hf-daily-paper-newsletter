summary: The paper proposes a new method to reduce mistakes made by Large Language Models by adding a special [IDK] token to the model's vocabulary and introducing an objective function that shifts probability mass to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions. This allows the model to express uncertainty in its output explicitly. The method is evaluated across multiple model architectures and factual downstream tasks, and it is found that models trained with this method are able to express uncertainty in...
