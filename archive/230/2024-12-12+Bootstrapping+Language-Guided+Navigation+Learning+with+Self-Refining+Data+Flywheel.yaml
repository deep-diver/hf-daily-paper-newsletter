summary: This paper proposes a method to improve the quality and quantity of data used for training language-guided agents in embodied AI. It uses a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that iteratively refines the data pool through the collaboration between two models, an instruction generator and a navigator, without human annotation. The SRDF process improves the performance of the navigator and the quality of the instructions generated by the generator. The method is scalable and generalizable to vario...
