summary: This study presents InterSyn, a high-quality, large-scale dataset for training multimodal models to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, and SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model for assessing such outputs. The dataset is constructed using a novel self-evaluation method that significantly enhances its quality, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of InterSyn in improving the performance of multimodal models....
