summary: This study presents a new GUI agent named Mirage-1 that can handle long-horizon tasks in online environments more effectively than existing agents. The researchers achieved this by introducing a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills module to improve knowledge acquisition and the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm to reduce the action search space during online exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents in various long-horizon scenarios....
