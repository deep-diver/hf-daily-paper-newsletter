summary: The study highlights a gap in evaluating the ability of large vision-language models to solve elementary-level math problems that require reasoning about visual concepts and introduces VCBENCH, a new benchmark for this purpose. The benchmark reveals that current models struggle with these tasks, indicating a need for further development in this area....
