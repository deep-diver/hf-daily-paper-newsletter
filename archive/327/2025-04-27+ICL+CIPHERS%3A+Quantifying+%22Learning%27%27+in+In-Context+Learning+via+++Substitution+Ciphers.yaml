summary: The study presents ICL CIPHERS, a new method to measure 'learning' in In-Context Learning (ICL) by using substitution ciphers from classical cryptography. This approach involves replacing some input tokens with irrelevant ones, creating a reversible pattern. The results show that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve these ciphers better than a non-reversible baseline, indicating their ability to decipher the ciphered inputs....
