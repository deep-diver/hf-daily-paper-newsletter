summary: A new method is proposed to create realistic videos using a two-stage framework that combines a Vision Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM). The VLM acts as a motion planner, predicting rough motion trajectories while considering real-world physical dynamics, and the VDM is used in the second stage to generate fine details in the motion....
