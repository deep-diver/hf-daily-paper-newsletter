summary: The paper proposes a new strategy for lightweight vision network design, inspired by the dynamic heteroscale vision ability in the human vision system. They introduce LS convolution, which combines large-kernel perception and small-kernel aggregation, and present LSNet, a new family of lightweight models that achieves superior performance and efficiency over existing lightweight networks in various vision tasks....
