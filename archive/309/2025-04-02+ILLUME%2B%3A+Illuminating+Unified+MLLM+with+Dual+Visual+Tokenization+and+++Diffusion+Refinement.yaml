summary: ILLUME+ is a model that improves deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image generation using dual visual tokenization and a diffusion decoder. It handles understanding, generation, and editing tasks better than existing unified models by using a unified dual visual tokenizer and a diffusion model as the image detokenizer, showing competitive performance against other models in multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks....
