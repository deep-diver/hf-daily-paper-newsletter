summary: The study presents an enhancement in visual-spatial reasoning for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) through R1-Zero-like training, identifying that CoT prompts alone are insufficient for small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models. They introduce vsGRPO, which utilizes GRPO training and a curated VSI-100k dataset, outperforming the base model by 12.1% with 120 GPU hours and achieving results comparable to LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B....
