summary: The authors propose Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD), a new method for creating high-quality character animations by combining skeleton-based animation techniques with modern generative models. AKD focuses on joint-level control, making motion synthesis more efficient and consistent, and uses Score Distillation Sampling with pre-trained video diffusion models to distill complex, articulated motions while maintaining shape consistency, and also ensures physically plausible interactions....
