summary: This study proposes a two-stage training framework, Dyna-Mind, to enhance AI agents' performance in complex interactive environments by teaching them to simulate alternative futures before acting. The framework includes a reasoning method, ReSim, to generate structured reasoning traces and an online reinforcement learning method, Dyna-GRPO, to strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability. Experiments show that Dyna-Mind improves AI agents' reasoning, planning, and action in vari...
