summary: The authors present a new method called Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG) that improves image generation by diffusion models without modifying the model's architecture or adding significant computational overhead. TAG works by using an intermediate sample as a reference and adjusting the generation process to reduce inconsistencies and improve sample quality....
