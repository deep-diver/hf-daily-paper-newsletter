summary: This study proposes a new framework called Tenet to improve the efficiency of segmenting objects in videos based on a query sentence. By using pre-trained object detectors and trackers, Tenet generates and selects high-quality temporal prompts to guide image-based segmentation models, resulting in accurate and efficient object segmentation in videos....
