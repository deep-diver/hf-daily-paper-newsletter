summary: This study presents a new method, UML, for training models using unpaired multimodal data, which can improve representation learning in a target modality without needing paired datasets. By processing inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters, the model benefits from cross-modal structure, leading to better performance in downstream tasks for various unimodal targets like images and audio....
