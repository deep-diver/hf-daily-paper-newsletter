summary: The authors present a method to create a large and diverse dataset of question-answer pairs for reinforcement learning (RL) by converting extensive pre-training documents, which is a major challenge in RL. The resulting Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples, enables more efficient RL training, outperforming continual pre-training with up to 100 times fewer tokens....
