summary: The authors present a new method called Hybrid-depth that combines foundation models to improve depth estimation in self-supervised monocular vision. By integrating semantic context from CLIP and spatial details from DINO, their coarse-to-fine approach enhances depth perception, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI benchmark....
