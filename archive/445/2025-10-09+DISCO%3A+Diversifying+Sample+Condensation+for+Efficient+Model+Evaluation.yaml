summary: The study presents DISCO, a method for selecting the top-k samples that maximize model disagreements, which is simpler and more efficient than traditional clustering-based approaches for evaluating machine learning models. DISCO has shown empirical gains over prior methods and achieved state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across various benchmarks....
