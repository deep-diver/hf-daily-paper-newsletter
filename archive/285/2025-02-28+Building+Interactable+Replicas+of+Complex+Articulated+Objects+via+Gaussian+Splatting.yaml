summary: ArtGS is a novel approach for building interactive replicas of complex articulated objects that uses 3D Gaussians to effectively integrate information across different object states, improving part-mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. It outperforms existing methods in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction, especially for multi-part objects, and provides a new benchmark for complex multi-part object datasets....
