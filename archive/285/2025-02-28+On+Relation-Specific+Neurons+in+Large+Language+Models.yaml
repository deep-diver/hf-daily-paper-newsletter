summary: This study investigates the existence of neurons in large language models that focus on a specific relation, independent of any entity. Experiments with Llama-2 family demonstrate the existence of such relation-specific neurons, showing properties like neuron cumulativity, versatility, and interference. The findings can improve understanding of LLM internal mechanisms and potentially enhance their performance....
