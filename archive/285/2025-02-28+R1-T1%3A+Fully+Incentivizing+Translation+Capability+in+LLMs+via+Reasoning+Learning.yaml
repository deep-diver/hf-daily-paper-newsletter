summary: The study presents R1-Translator (R1-T1), a novel framework that integrates inference-time reasoning into machine translation via reinforcement learning with human-aligned CoTs, overcoming limitations of existing methods by pioneering innovations like extending reasoning-based translation to diverse tasks and languages, formalizing six expert-curated CoT templates, and enabling self-evolving CoT discovery and anti-forgetting adaptation. Experimental results show steady performance improvement in...
