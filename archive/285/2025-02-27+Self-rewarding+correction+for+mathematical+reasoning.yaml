summary: The research presents a method for creating self-rewarding reasoning models using a two-staged algorithmic framework, which includes sequential rejection sampling and reinforcement learning with rule-based signals. These models can autonomously correct errors in their responses and refine outputs without external feedback, as demonstrated with Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5....
