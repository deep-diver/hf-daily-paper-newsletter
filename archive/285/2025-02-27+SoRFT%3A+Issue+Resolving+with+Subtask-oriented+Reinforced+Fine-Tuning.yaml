summary: The proposed SoRFT method enhances issue resolving capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by breaking down the process into subtasks and using a two-stage training approach of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. This framework outperforms other open-source models in solving issues on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite datasets....
