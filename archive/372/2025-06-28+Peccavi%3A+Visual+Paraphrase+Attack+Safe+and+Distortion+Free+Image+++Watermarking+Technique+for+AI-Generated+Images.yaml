summary: The researchers present a new method called PECCAVI that embeds watermarks safely and without distortion in AI-generated images, even resisting visual paraphrase attacks which can alter images while preserving key areas. This technique strategically places watermarks in crucial image areas and uses advanced frequency domain watermarking and noisy burnishing to prevent tampering and reverse-engineering....
