summary: ChemAgent is a framework that improves the performance of large language models in chemical reasoning tasks by using a dynamic, self-updating library. It decomposes chemical tasks into sub-tasks, compiles them into a structured collection, and retrieves and refines information from the library to facilitate effective task decomposition and solution generation. ChemAgent outperforms existing methods by up to 46% (GPT-4) and has potential applications in drug discovery and materials science....
