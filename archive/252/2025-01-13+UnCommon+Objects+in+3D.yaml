summary: We present uCO3D, a new dataset for 3D deep learning and 3D generative AI, which is the largest publicly-available collection of high-resolution videos of objects with 3D annotations that ensures full-360 coverage. uCO3D covers more than 1,000 object categories and is of higher quality due to extensive quality checks of both the collected videos and the 3D annotations. It also contains additional annotations such as 3D Gaussian Splat reconstruction and object captions. Training large 3D models o...
