summary: This paper discusses the challenges in developing Process Reward Models (PRMs) for Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes a consensus filtering mechanism to improve model performance and data efficiency. The paper also introduces a new state-of-the-art PRM and provides practical guidelines for future research in building process supervision models....
