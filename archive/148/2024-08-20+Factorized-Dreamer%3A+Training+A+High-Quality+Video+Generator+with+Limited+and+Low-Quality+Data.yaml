summary: 'This paper proposes a new method for text-to-video generation that uses publicly available limited and low-quality data. The method factors the process into two steps: generating an image conditioned on a caption and synthesizing a video conditioned on the generated image and a caption of motion details. The method uses an adapter to combine text and image embeddings, a pixel-aware cross attention module to capture pixel-level image information, a T5 text encoder to better understand motion desc...'
