summary: The paper proposes a method called SpaRP to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate camera poses from one or a few unposed 2D images of an object. SpaRP uses a diffusion model to predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-view images of the object, which are then used to accomplish 3D reconstruction and pose estimation. The method is efficient and outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and pose prediction accuracy....
