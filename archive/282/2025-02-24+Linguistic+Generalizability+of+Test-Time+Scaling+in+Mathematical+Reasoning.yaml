summary: A multilingual math benchmark, MCLM, is presented and tested with three test-time scaling methods, ORM, PROM, and BF, on Qwen2.5-1.5B Math and MR1-1.5B. Results show that BF on MR1-1.5B attains 35.2 on MCLM, while ORM on Qwen2.5-1.5B Math gets 35.8, but test-time scaling may not generalize well to multilingual tasks as English AIME sees a 20-point improvement while other languages see only 1.94 points average gain....
