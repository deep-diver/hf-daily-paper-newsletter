summary: The paper introduces GCC, a color constancy method using diffusion models to adapt to various camera sensors by inpainting color checkers for illumination estimation. It offers superior robustness in cross-camera scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art results in bi-directional evaluations, without requiring sensor-specific training....
