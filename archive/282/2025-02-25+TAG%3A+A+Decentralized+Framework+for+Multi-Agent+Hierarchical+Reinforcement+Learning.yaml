summary: The proposed TAME Agent Framework (TAG) is a decentralized framework for creating hierarchical multi-agent systems, allowing for flexible hierarchies of any depth through the LevelEnv concept. TAG improves learning speed and final performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines, making it a promising approach for scalable multi-agent systems....
