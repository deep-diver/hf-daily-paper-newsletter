summary: 'The work focuses on improving the efficiency of quality estimation models in machine translation by addressing two challenges: reducing the cost of quality estimation at scale and developing an affordable uncertainty estimation method. The proposed solution includes Instant Confidence COMET, an uncertainty-aware quality estimation model, and Early-Exit COMET, a model that computes quality scores and confidences at early model layers, which helps to early-exit computations and reduce evaluation c...'
