summary: This study focuses on the safety and reliability of large language models in low resource device deployment using quantization methods. The authors introduce a novel open-ended safety dataset called OpenSafetyMini, which is used to evaluate four state-of-the-art quantization techniques across LLaMA and Mistral models using four benchmarks, including human evaluations. The findings reveal that the optimal quantization method varies for 4-bit precision, while vector quantization techniques deliver...
