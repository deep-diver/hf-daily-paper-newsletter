summary: The research proposes a framework to predict the influence and adoption of open-weight AI models, based on the citation dynamics in scientific literature. The model uses three parameters to track the number of fine-tuned models for a given open-weight model, and finds that it can effectively capture the diverse trajectories of model adoption....
