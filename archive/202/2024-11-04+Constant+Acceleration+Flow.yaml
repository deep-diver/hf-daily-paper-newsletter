summary: The paper presents a new framework called Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF) that improves the accuracy of learning straight trajectories between image and noise pairs in few-step generation by introducing acceleration as a learnable variable. CAF outperforms existing methods for one-step generation and significantly enhances few-step coupling preservation and inversion compared to Rectified flow....
