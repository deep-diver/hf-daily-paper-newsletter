summary: The paper proposes a two-component fine-tuning method to improve Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance in solving scientific problems. The first component, World Knowledge Distillation (WKD), helps LLMs internalize domain knowledge by learning from solutions generated using tools' information. The second component, Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), partitions problems into easy and hard categories and trains the model to intelligently switch to tool usage for more challenging problems. The method...
