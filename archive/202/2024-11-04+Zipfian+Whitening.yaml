summary: The paper introduces a method called Zipfian Whitening, which improves task performance in neural models by correcting the skewed word embedding space. It does this by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) weighted by the empirical word frequency, which follows Zipf's law. The method emphasizes informative low-frequency words in terms of their vector norm, and it aligns with popular NLP methods like skip-gram negative sampling, WhiteningBERT, and headless language models. The theory behi...
