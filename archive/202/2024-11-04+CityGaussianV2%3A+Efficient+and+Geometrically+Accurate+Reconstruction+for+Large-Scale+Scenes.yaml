summary: CityGaussianV2 is a new approach for large-scale scene reconstruction that improves geometric accuracy and efficiency. It addresses convergence and scalability issues in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) by implementing a decomposed-gradient-based densification and depth regression technique, and introducing an elongation filter. The method also optimizes the CityGaussian pipeline for parallel training, achieving up to 10times compression, at least 25% savings in training time, and a 50% decrease in ...
