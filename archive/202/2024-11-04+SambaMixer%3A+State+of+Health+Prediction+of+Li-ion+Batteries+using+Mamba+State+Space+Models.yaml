summary: This paper introduces SambaMixer, a new model for predicting the state of health of Li-ion batteries. It outperforms current models and uses a new resampling method to improve performance. The model takes into account the sample time and cycle time difference to predict the SOH of Li-ion batteries with high accuracy and robustness....
