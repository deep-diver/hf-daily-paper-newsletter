summary: Researchers reevaluate and streamline the use of diffusion transformers for task-agnostic image generation by hypothesizing that they have in-context generation capabilities. They propose a simple pipeline to leverage these abilities, resulting in high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts. The framework remains task-agnostic in architecture and pipeline, offering a powerful tool for the community and valuable insights for further research....
