summary: 'This research explores why Large Vision-Language Models sometimes invent unrelated visual details (known as hallucination) and proposes VISTA, a method to reduce hallucination without extra training or supervision. By examining token logits rankings, the study identifies three hallucination patterns: visual info loss, early semantic token activation, and hidden genuine info. VISTA mitigates hallucination by reinforcing visual info and using early layer activations for better decoding, which lead...'
