summary: This study explores how to optimize compute-efficient Test-Time Scaling (TTS) for various policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulties. The research reveals that smaller language models can outperform larger ones through compute-optimal TTS strategies, with a 1B LLM exceeding a 405B LLM on MATH-500 and a 0.5B LLM outperforming GPT-4o....
