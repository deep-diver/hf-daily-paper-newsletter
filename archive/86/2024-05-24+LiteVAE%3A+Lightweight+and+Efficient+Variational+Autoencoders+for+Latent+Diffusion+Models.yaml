summary: LiteVAE is a family of autoencoders for latent diffusion models that uses the 2D discrete wavelet transform to improve scalability and efficiency without sacrificing output quality. It has a smaller number of parameters and faster training times compared to standard VAEs, and can outperform VAEs of similar complexity in image generation tasks....
