summary: DiM is a new image generation model that uses Mamba, a sequence model based on State Space Models, to efficiently generate high-resolution images. It combines the efficiency of Mamba with the expressive power of diffusion models and can be trained on low-resolution images and then finetuned on high-resolution images. It also explores training-free upsampling strategies to generate even higher-resolution images....
