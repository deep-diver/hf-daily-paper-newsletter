summary: 'The study presents a new method to improve automated theorem proving by creating more robust models that can handle different problem statements. They achieve this by using two techniques: EvolAST and EvolDomain, which generate equivalent problem variants by exploiting symmetry, and EvolDifficulty, which creates theorems with varying levels of difficulty. The resulting model, EvolProver, outperforms other models in several benchmarks....'
