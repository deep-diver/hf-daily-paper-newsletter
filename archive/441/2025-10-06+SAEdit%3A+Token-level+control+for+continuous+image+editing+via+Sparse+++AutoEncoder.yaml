summary: The authors present a method for fine-tuning image editing by manipulating text embeddings, which allows for separate control of different image attributes and smooth adjustment of edit strength. They use a Sparse Autoencoder to find directions in the text embeddings that control specific attributes, enabling model-agnostic and broadly applicable image editing without altering the diffusion process....
