summary: The authors present a new framework called MITS that uses information theory to evaluate and guide reasoning in large language models. MITS evaluates reasoning paths step-by-step using a scoring function based on pointwise mutual information, which is more efficient than simulating different reasoning paths. The framework adaptively allocates computational resources to uncertain steps and combines scores with prediction consensus for final output, outperforming baseline methods in various reason...
