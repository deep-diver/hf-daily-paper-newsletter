summary: This research explores the use of stale data in reinforcement learning for large language models and introduces M2PO, an algorithm that effectively utilizes stale data without compromising performance. M2PO reduces the need for fresh data updates, improving efficiency and scalability, and has been shown to match on-policy performance across various models and benchmarks....
