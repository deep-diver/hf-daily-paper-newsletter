summary: The paper introduces Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a scalable reinforcement learning system that separates the training and search phases for large language models. This leads to faster training times, improved diversity, and scalable search for sparse rewards, outperforming existing methods on various post-training tasks....
