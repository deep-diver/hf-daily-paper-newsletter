summary: The proposed method uses a single motion-blurred image to estimate camera motion by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map, then solving a linear least squares problem to recover the instantaneous camera velocity. This approach, trained on synthetic and real data, provides robust and accurate camera motion estimation for fast and aggressive movements, outperforming other methods like MASt3R and COLMAP....
