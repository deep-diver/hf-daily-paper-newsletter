summary: A new method, MCTS-RAG, improves small language models' reasoning on knowledge-intensive tasks by blending retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), allowing dynamic integration of retrieval and reasoning, reducing hallucinations, and boosting factual accuracy and consistency. Experiments on datasets like ComplexWebQA, GPQA, and FoolMeTwice show that MCTS-RAG helps small-scale LMs achieve performance similar to advanced LLMs like GPT-4o by efficiently scaling infe...
