summary: MolReFlect is a new method that helps large language models (LLMs) better understand and generate molecules by aligning their structures with text descriptions. The method uses a teacher-student framework, chain-of-thought reasoning, and in-context reflection to improve the accuracy and explainability of predictions. MolReFlect outperforms previous methods on the ChEBI-20 dataset and could have applications in medicine and materials science....
