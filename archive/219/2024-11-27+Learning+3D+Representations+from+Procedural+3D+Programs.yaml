summary: We propose a new method for learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from this synthesized dataset perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. Our ...
