summary: This paper introduces TEXGen, a new generative diffusion model that can generate high-resolution texture maps for 3D assets in a feed-forward manner. It uses a scalable network architecture that interleaves convolutions on UV maps with attention layers on point clouds, and it can be trained to generate texture maps guided by text prompts and single-view images. The model can also be used for text-guided texture inpainting, sparse-view texture completion, and text-driven texture synthesis....
