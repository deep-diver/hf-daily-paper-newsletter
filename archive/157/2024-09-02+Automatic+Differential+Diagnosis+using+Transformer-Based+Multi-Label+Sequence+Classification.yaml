summary: This study introduces a transformer-based approach for providing differential diagnoses based on a patient's age, sex, medical history, and symptoms. The study uses the DDXPlus dataset and proposes a method to process the tabular patient data and engineer them into patient reports. The study also introduces two data modification modules to diversify the training data and improve the robustness of the models.
