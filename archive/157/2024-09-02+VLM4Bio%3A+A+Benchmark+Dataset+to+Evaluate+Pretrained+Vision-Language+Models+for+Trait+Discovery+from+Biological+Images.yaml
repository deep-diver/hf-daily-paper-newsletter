summary: This paper evaluates 12 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) in the field of organismal biology using a new dataset called VLM4Bio. The dataset contains 469K question-answer pairs involving 30K images of fishes, birds, and butterflies. The study explores the effects of prompting techniques and tests for reasoning hallucination on the performance of VLMs, shedding light on their capabilities in answering biologically relevant questions using images. The code and datasets for the analyse...
