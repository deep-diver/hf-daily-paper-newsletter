summary: This paper proposes a hybrid strategy to adapt large language models (LLMs) for understanding scientific literature. The strategy combines continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning to infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities. The authors address challenges in constructing high-quality training corpora and generating diverse instructions through a meticulous pipeline. The resulting models, SciLitLLM, demonstrate improved performance on scientific l...
