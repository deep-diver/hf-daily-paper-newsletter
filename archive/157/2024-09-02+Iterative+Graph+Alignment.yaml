summary: Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA) is a new method that helps large language models (LLMs) better follow rules by aligning their responses with logical graphs created by a teacher model (VLM). The student model (LLM) identifies knowledge gaps and collaborates with helper models to generate diverse answers, which are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to improved rule-based alignment, as demonstrated in five different scenarios....
