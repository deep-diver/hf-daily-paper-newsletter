summary: We introduce the first multi-omic nucleotide-peptide foundation models for understanding and predicting the properties of biomolecules. These models can learn joint representations between various single-omic distributions and achieve state-of-the-art results on peptide-nucleotide interaction tasks, such as predicting the change in Gibbs free energy of the binding interaction between a given oligonucleotide and peptide, as well as the effect on this binding interaction due to mutations in the ol...
