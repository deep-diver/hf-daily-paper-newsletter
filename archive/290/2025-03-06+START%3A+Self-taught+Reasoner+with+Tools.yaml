summary: The START model is a new long-chain-of-thought reasoning LLM that improves reasoning abilities by using external tools, such as code execution for complex computations, self-checking, exploring diverse methods, and self-debugging. It uses a self-learning framework with Hint-infer and Hint Rejection Sampling Fine-Tuning to fine-tune the QwQ-32B model, achieving high accuracy rates on various benchmarks....
