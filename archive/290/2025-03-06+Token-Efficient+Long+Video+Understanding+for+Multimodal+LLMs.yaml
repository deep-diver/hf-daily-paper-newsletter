summary: STORM is a new architecture for video-based multimodal large language models that incorporates a temporal encoder to improve understanding of long videos and reduce computational demands. By integrating techniques such as test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks while reducing computation costs and decoding latency....
