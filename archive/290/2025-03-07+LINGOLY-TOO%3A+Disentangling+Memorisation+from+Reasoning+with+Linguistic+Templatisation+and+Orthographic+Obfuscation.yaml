summary: The study describes a framework to create linguistic reasoning problems that minimize the impact of memorization in language models' performance, leading to a new benchmark called LINGOLY-TOO. This benchmark generates numerous variations of questions using orthographic templates, ensuring the same reasoning steps while reducing the appearance of specific problems in training data. The results show that advanced reasoning is challenging for frontier models, and their performance varies across pro...
