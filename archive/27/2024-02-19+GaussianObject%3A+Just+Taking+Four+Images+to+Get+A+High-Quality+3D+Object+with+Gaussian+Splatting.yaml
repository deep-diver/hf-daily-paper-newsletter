summary: 'Reconstructing and rendering 3D objects from highly sparse views is of critical
  importance for promoting applications of 3D vision techniques and improving user
  experience. However, images from sparse views only contain very limited 3D information,
  leading to two significant challenges: 1) Difficulty in building multi-view consistency
  as images for matching are too few; 2) Partially omitted or highly compressed object
  information as view coverage is insufficient. To tackle these challenges, we p...'
