summary: We present Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) -- a data collection and
  policy learning framework that allows direct skill transfer from in-the-wild human
  demonstrations to deployable robot policies. UMI employs hand-held grippers coupled
  with careful interface design to enable portable, low-cost, and information-rich
  data collection for challenging bimanual and dynamic manipulation demonstrations.
  To facilitate deployable policy learning, UMI incorporates a carefully designed
  policy interfac...
