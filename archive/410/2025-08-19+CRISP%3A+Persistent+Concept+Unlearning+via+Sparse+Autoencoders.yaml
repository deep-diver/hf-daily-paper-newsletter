summary: The study presents CRISP, a method that uses sparse autoencoders to permanently remove unwanted knowledge from large language models, which is more effective and secure than existing techniques. CRISP outperforms previous approaches in removing harmful knowledge while maintaining the model's overall performance and is capable of precisely suppressing target features....
