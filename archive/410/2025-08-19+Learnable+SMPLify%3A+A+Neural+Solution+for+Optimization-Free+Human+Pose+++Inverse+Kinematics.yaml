summary: The authors present a new method called Learnable SMPLify that uses artificial neural networks to estimate human pose and shape in 3D, replacing the iterative optimization process found in the previous SMPLify method. This new approach is much faster, up to 200 times faster, and can generalize better to unseen poses and motions, making it a practical and simple baseline for 3D human pose and shape estimation....
