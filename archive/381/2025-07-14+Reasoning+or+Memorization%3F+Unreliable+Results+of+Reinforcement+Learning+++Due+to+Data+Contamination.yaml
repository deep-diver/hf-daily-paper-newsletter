summary: This study investigates the reasoning performance of large language models using reinforcement learning and finds that the reported improvements might be unreliable due to data contamination in popular benchmarks. The researchers introduce a new generator to create clean datasets and demonstrate that accurate reward signals consistently improve performance, while noisy or incorrect signals do not....
