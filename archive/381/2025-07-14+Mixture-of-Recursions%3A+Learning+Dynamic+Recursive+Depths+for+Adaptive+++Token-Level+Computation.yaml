summary: The authors present a new framework called Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) that combines parameter sharing and adaptive computation in a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reduces computational and memory demands by reusing layers and dynamically assigning recursion depths to individual tokens, resulting in improved efficiency and performance compared to existing models....
