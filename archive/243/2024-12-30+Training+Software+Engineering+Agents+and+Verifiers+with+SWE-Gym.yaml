summary: SWE-Gym, a software engineering environment, is introduced to train agents and verifiers using real-world Python tasks. The paper presents a method to train language model-based SWE agents, achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate. The paper also introduces the use of verifiers trained on agent trajectories, resulting in a new state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents....
