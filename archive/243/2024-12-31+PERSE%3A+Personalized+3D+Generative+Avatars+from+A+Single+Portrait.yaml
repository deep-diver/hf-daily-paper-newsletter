summary: PERSE is a method that creates a personalized 3D avatar from a single portrait, allowing for the editing of facial attributes in a continuous and disentangled latent space. It uses a synthetic attribute dataset and a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos. The method enforces smooth transitions in the latent space using a latent space regularization technique and produces high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving the identity of the reference pe...
