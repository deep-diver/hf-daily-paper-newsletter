summary: Dynasor is a system that optimizes inference-time compute for LLM reasoning queries by tracking and scheduling requests within the queries and using Certaindex, a proxy that measures statistical reasoning progress based on model certainty, to guide compute allocation dynamically. It co-adapts scheduling with reasoning progress to balance accuracy, latency, and cost, reducing compute by up to 50% in batch processing and sustaining higher query rates or tighter latency SLOs in online serving....
