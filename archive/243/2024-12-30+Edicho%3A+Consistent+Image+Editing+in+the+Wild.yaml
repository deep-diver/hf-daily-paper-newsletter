summary: Edicho is an algorithm that uses diffusion models to make image editing more consistent across different images, even when factors like object poses, lighting conditions, and photography environments change. It uses an attention manipulation module and a refined classifier-free guidance denoising strategy, both of which take into account pre-estimated image correspondence. The algorithm is compatible with most diffusion-based editing methods and has been shown to work well in various settings. T...
