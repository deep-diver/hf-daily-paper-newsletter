summary: The paper describes a new method for animating user-provided 3D objects by using text prompts to guide the animation process. The method involves converting a 3D mesh into a 4D NeRF and then using an Image-to-Video diffusion model to animate the object. The paper also introduces an incremental viewpoint selection protocol and a masked Score Distillation Sampling loss to improve motion realism. The method is evaluated and found to outperform other approaches in terms of temporal coherence, prompt...
