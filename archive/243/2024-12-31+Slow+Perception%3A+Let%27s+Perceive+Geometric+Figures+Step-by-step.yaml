summary: This paper introduces a concept called 'slow perception' where the model gradually perceives basic point-line combinations to reconstruct complex geometric structures. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of copying geometric figures, which is considered the first step to visual reasoning. The paper proposes a 'perceptual ruler' to trace each line stroke-by-stroke and suggests that a slower perception manner can lead to better results....
