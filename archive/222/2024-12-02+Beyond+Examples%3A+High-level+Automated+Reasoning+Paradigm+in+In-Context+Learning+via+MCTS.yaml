summary: This paper proposes a new approach called HiAR-ICL to improve the traditional way of using large language models for complex mathematical reasoning tasks. HiAR-ICL focuses on abstract thinking patterns instead of specific examples and uses a method called Monte Carlo Tree Search to explore reasoning paths and construct thought cards to guide inference. The approach also includes a cognitive complexity framework to match problems with appropriate thought cards. HiAR-ICL was tested on a benchmark ...
