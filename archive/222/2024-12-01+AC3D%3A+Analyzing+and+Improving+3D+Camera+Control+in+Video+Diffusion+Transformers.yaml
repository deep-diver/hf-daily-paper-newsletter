summary: This paper analyzes and improves 3D camera control in video diffusion transformers by adjusting train and test pose conditioning schedules, limiting camera conditioning injection, and complementing the dataset for camera control learning. The resulting Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture is the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control....
