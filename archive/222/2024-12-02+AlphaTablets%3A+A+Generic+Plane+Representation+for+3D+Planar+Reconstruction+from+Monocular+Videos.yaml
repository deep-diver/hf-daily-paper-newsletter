summary: AlphaTablets is a new way to represent 3D planes that combines the best parts of 2D and 3D representations, allowing for more accurate and flexible modeling. It uses a differentiable rasterization process and a bottom-up pipeline to reconstruct complete and accurate 3D planes from monocular videos, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction....
