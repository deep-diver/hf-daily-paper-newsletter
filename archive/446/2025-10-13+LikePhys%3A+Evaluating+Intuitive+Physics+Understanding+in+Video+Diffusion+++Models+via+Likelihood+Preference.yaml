summary: The study presents LikePhys, a method to evaluate intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models by comparing physically valid and impossible videos. The method, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), aligns well with human preference and outperforms existing evaluators, revealing improvements in physics understanding with larger model capacity and better inference settings....
