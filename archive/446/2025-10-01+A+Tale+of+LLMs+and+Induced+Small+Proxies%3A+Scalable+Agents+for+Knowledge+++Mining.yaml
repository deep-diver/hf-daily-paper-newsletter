summary: The research presents Falconer, a framework that combines large language models with lightweight proxy models for efficient knowledge mining. Falconer reduces inference cost by up to 90% and speeds up knowledge mining by over 20 times compared to state-of-the-art language models, making it a scalable solution for extracting information from large text datasets....
