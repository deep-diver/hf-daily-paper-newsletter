summary: This study presents a new approach called Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI) that incorporates complex visual and multimodal policies into model parameters, allowing conversational agents to follow these policies more effectively without needing them during inference. The researchers developed two datasets and a three-stage training framework called TriMPI, which significantly improves accuracy, generalization, and robustness in multimodal tasks, and made their resources available to encour...
