summary: The authors address the challenge of preventing harm from multi-step tasks executed by LLM agents by proposing a foundational guardrail for pre-execution safety. They introduce AuraGen for generating large, reliable datasets with synthetic trajectories, Safiron as a compact guardian model to flag risky cases, and Pre-Exec Bench for evaluating guardrail performance, all of which contribute to safer agentic systems....
