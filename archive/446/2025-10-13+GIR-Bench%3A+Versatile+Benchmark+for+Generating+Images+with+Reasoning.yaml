summary: 'The authors present GIR-Bench, a new benchmark for testing unified multimodal models in reasoning-centric tasks. This benchmark evaluates models in three areas: understanding-generation consistency, reasoning-centric text-to-image generation, and multi-step reasoning in editing. The results show that while unified models can perform these tasks, they still struggle with aligning understanding and generation....'
