summary: The study examines how visual perception impacts multimodal reasoning in complex models, finding that only some generated tokens rely heavily on visual information. They then propose a new method, Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), which improves learning by focusing on these key visual tokens, outperforming existing models on various benchmarks....
