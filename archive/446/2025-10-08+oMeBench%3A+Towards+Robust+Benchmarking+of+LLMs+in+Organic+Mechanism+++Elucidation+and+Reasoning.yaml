summary: The study presents oMeBench, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for evaluating large language models' ability to understand and reason organic chemistry mechanisms. The authors propose a dynamic evaluation framework, oMeS, to assess model performance more precisely. They find that while current models have some chemical intuition, they struggle with multi-step reasoning, but performance can be improved with specific strategies and fine-tuning....
