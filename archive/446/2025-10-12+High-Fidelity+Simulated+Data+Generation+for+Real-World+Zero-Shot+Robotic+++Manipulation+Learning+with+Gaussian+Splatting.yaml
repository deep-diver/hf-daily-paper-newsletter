summary: This study presents a new method called RoboSimGS that creates realistic and interactive simulation environments for robotic manipulation using multi-view real-world images, addressing the challenge of generalizing simulated data to real-world applications. The approach combines 3D Gaussian Splatting and mesh primitives to reconstruct scenes, and uses a Multi-modal Large Language Model to automatically create physically plausible and articulated assets, enabling successful zero-shot sim-to-real ...
