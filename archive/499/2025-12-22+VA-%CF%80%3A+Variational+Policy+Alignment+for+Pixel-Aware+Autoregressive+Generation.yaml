summary: The paper presents VA-pi, a new method that improves the quality of images generated by autoregressive visual models by aligning them with tokenizers using a variational optimization approach and reinforcement learning. This method provides direct pixel-level guidance to the model, resulting in better image reconstruction and higher image quality metrics without requiring additional data or complex training processes....
