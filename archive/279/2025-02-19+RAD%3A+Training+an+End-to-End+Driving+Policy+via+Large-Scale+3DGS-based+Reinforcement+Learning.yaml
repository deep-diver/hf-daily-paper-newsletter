summary: This work introduces a new approach for training end-to-end autonomous driving policies using a 3DGS-based closed-loop reinforcement learning paradigm. The method constructs a photorealistic digital replica of the real world, enabling extensive exploration of the state space and handling out-of-distribution scenarios, while incorporating imitation learning as a regularization term for better alignment with human driving behavior....
