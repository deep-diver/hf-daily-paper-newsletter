summary: This study introduces ActionPiece, a method that contextually tokenizes action sequences for generative recommendation to improve performance, by considering action sequence context, creating tokens from feature patterns, and using set permutation regularization to handle unordered feature sets. Experiments on public datasets show that ActionPiece outperforms existing action tokenization methods, improving NDCG@10 by 6.00% to 12.82%....
