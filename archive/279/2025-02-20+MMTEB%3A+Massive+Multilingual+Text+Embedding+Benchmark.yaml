summary: The study presents the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB), a large-scale benchmark for text embeddings that includes 500+ tasks across 250+ languages. MMTEB includes novel tasks like instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval. The authors found that a 560M-parameter model outperformed larger LLMs in some cases. They also introduced optimizations like a downsampling method based on inter-task correlation and hard negative sampling for tasks like retrieva...
