summary: The paper presents Autellix, a system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize end-to-end latencies in LLM serving engines. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context and utilizing two scheduling algorithms for single-threaded and distributed programs. The results show that Autellix improves the throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to existing systems....
