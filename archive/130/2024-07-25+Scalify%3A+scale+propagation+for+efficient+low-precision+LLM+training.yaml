summary: Scalify is a method for training large language models using low-precision formats like float8, which can improve computational efficiency. It simplifies the process and supports float8 matrix multiplication and gradients representation, as well as float16 optimizer state storage. The JAX implementation of Scalify is available open-source at https://github.com/graphcore-research/jax-scalify....
