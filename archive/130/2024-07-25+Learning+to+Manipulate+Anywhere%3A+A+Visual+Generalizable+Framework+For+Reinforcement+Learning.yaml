summary: We present Maniwhere, a framework for teaching robots to manipulate objects in various environments using visual reinforcement learning. Our approach involves learning from multiple viewpoints and using a curriculum-based randomization and augmentation method to improve the robot's ability to generalize in different scenarios. Experiments show that Maniwhere outperforms existing methods and can be applied to different hardware platforms....
