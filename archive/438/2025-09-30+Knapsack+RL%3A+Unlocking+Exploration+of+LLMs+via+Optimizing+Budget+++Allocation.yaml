summary: The study proposes a method to optimize the allocation of exploration budgets in large language models during reinforcement learning, addressing the issue of uniform allocation that leads to inefficient use of resources. By formulating the problem as a knapsack problem, the method adaptively distributes resources based on the model's learning status, resulting in improved performance on challenging tasks and significant gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks....
