summary: The study presents BatonVoice, a new framework that enhances speech synthesis by utilizing the linguistic intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs). It separates instruction understanding from speech generation, where an LLM creates a textual plan of vocal features, which a separate TTS model then uses to generate speech. The approach improves controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming existing models and enabling zero-shot cross-lingual generalization....
