summary: This study presents a new method called VLM-FO1 that improves the ability of Vision-Language Models to accurately locate and understand specific visual details, which they previously struggled with. The method works by converting the challenging task of generating precise coordinates into a more manageable one and can be easily added to existing models, leading to better performance in various perception tasks without affecting their overall visual understanding....
