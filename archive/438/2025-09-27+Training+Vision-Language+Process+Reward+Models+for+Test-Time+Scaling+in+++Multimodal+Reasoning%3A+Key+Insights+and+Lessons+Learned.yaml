summary: This study explores ways to improve Vision-Language Process Reward Models (VL-PRMs) for multimodal reasoning by introducing a hybrid data synthesis framework, perception-focused supervision, and evaluating test-time scaling strategies. Experiments on five benchmarks reveal that smaller VL-PRMs can be as effective as larger ones, perception-level supervision significantly improves performance, and VL-PRMs can uncover hidden reasoning abilities in VLMs....
