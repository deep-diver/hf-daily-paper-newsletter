summary: This study investigates why transformer models struggle with multi-digit multiplication and discovers that they lack long-range dependencies. The researchers reverse-engineer a model that can perform multiplication and find that it uses attention to create a graph for storing and retrieving partial products, as well as efficient representations like Minkowski sums and Fourier basis. They then introduce an auxiliary loss to help standard models learn these dependencies, improving their ability to...
