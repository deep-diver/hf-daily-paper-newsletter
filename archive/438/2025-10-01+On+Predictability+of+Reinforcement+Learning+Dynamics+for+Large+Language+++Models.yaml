summary: This research discovers that the improvements in large language models during reinforcement learning training mainly come from a single direction of parameter updates, which changes in a predictable way. Using these insights, they developed a method to speed up training by up to 2.5 times without sacrificing performance, making it a useful tool for training large models efficiently....
