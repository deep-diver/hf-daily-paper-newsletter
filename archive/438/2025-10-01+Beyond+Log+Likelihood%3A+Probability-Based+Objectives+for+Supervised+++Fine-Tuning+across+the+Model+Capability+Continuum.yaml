summary: The study explores alternative probability-based objectives to the standard negative log likelihood (NLL) used in supervised fine-tuning of large language models. Through extensive experiments, they identify a 'model-capability continuum' that influences which objective performs best, offering a new way to tailor objectives to a model's strengths and weaknesses....
