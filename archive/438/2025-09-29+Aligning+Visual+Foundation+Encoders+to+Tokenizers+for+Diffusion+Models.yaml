summary: The authors propose a method to enhance image generation in diffusion models by aligning pretrained visual encoders as tokenizers, which captures both high-level semantics and perceptual details through a three-stage alignment strategy. This approach accelerates model convergence, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and LAION datasets, providing a simple and scalable solution for continuous tokenizer design....
