summary: This research presents a new method called SINQ to improve the accuracy of low-precision language models by addressing the issue of precision loss in outlier parameters. The method introduces an additional scale factor and a fast algorithm to normalize variances, resulting in significantly better performance on various models compared to traditional quantization techniques....
