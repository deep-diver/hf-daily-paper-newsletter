summary: This research presents a new method for automatically setting up software environments on personal devices using advanced machine learning techniques. By training a model to create Bash scripts and adapting it for environment setup, the method enables a model that runs on regular hardware to perform as well as much larger models, making it easier for developers and researchers to configure software environments without manual effort....
