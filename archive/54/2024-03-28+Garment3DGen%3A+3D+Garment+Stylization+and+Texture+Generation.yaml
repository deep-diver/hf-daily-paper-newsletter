summary: This paper introduces Garment3DGen, a method to create 3D textured clothes using a single input image or text prompt. The method generates 3D garment geometries and deforms a base template mesh to match the generated 3D target. It also generates high-fidelity texture maps and can generate simulation-ready 3D assets without artist intervention....
