summary: This paper presents EgoLifter, a system that can automatically segment scenes captured from egocentric sensors into individual 3D objects, using 3D Gaussians as the underlying representation and weak supervision from the Segment Anything Model. It includes a transient prediction module to handle dynamic objects and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in open-world 3D segmentation from natural egocentric input....
