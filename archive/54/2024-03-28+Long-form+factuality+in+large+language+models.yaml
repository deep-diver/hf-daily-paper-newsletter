summary: This paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators for factuality in long-form responses. The method, called Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE), breaks down a response into individual facts and evaluates their accuracy using search queries. The paper also introduces LongFact, a prompt set for benchmarking long-form factuality, and demonstrates that LLMs can achieve superhuman rating performance, while being more cost-effective than human annotators....
