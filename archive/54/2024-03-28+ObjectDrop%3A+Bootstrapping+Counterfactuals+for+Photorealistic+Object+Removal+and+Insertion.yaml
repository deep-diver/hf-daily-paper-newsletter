summary: The paper proposes a new approach to object removal and insertion in images by creating a counterfactual dataset of scenes before and after removing an object. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on this dataset, the method can remove objects and their effects on the scene. To enable photorealistic object insertion, the paper introduces bootstrap supervision, which expands the counterfactual dataset using the object removal model....
