summary: The paper introduces Heimdall, a long CoT verification LLM that accurately judges the correctness of solutions, improving verification accuracy with pure reinforcement learning and repeated sampling. Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities and is further extended through Pessimistic Verification to improve solution accuracy on AIME2025 with a solver model....
