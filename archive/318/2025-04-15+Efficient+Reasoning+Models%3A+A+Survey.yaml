summary: 'This survey focuses on the need for accelerating reasoning models, which have shown remarkable progress but suffer from computational overhead. The survey categorizes existing works into three directions: (1) compressing lengthy CoTs into more concise reasoning chains, (2) creating compact language models with strong reasoning capabilities through techniques like knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning, and (3) designing efficient decoding strategies to speed up inference....'
