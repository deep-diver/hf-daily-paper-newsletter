summary: The paper proposes NormalCrafter, a novel method for video-based surface normal estimation that leverages temporal priors of video diffusion models. It introduces Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR) to align diffusion features with semantic cues, ensuring high-fidelity normal estimation across sequences, and a two-stage training protocol for spatial accuracy and long temporal context....
