summary: This study investigates the performance of large language models (LLMs) on culturally adapted math problems, using synthetic datasets generated from GSM8K. Results reveal that LLMs struggle with math problems when cultural references change, even with constant mathematical structure. Smaller models exhibit greater performance drops, but cultural familiarity can enhance mathematical reasoning, sometimes outperforming larger models....
