summary: MetaSpatial is a reinforcement learning framework that improves 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models, enabling realistic layout generation without hard-coded optimizations. It addresses the lack of spatial reasoning and inefficiency of supervised fine-tuning, using a multi-turn RL-based mechanism with physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations for better scene coherence and object placement....
