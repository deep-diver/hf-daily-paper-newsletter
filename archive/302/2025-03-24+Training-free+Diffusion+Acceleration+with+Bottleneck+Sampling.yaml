summary: The work describes a method called Bottleneck Sampling that uses low-resolution priors from pre-trained diffusion models to reduce computational overhead during inference without compromising output quality. This method is evaluated on both image and video generation tasks and is shown to accelerate inference by up to 3 times for image generation and 2.5 times for video generation while maintaining output quality comparable to the standard full-resolution sampling process....
