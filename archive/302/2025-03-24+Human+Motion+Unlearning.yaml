summary: The paper focuses on the issue of generating toxic animations through text-to-motion generative models. It introduces a new task called 'Human Motion Unlearning' and a benchmark for evaluating it. The authors also propose a novel model, Latent Code Replacement (LCR), which is training-free and suitable for discrete latent spaces of state-of-the-art text-to-motion models. LCR consistently outperforms baselines in qualitative and quantitative evaluations....
