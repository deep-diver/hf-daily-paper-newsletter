summary: The authors propose Diffusion-4K, a framework for creating ultra-high-resolution images using text-to-image diffusion models. They build a 4K image dataset, introduce new metrics to evaluate image details, and apply wavelet-based fine-tuning to train their models, which perform well in high-quality image synthesis and text prompt adherence....
