summary: The study utilizes Sparse Autoencoders to understand the reasoning mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically the DeepSeek-R1 series. By identifying and steering 'reasoning features' extracted from SAE representations, the research demonstrates a direct correlation with the model's reasoning abilities and improved reasoning performance....
