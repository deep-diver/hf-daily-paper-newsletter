summary: This study presents a new weight initialization scheme and variance control strategy for Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training. The Layer Index Rescaling (LIR) scheme and Target Variance Rescaling (TVR) strategy improve downstream task performance and minimize extreme activation values, simplifying quantization and low-precision training challenges....
