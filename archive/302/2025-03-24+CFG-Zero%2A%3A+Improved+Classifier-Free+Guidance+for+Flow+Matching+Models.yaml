summary: This study analyzes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in flow matching models and finds that it can direct samples to incorrect trajectories early in training. The authors propose CFG-Zero*, an improved CFG with optimized scale and zero-init to address this issue, which outperforms CFG in text-to-image and text-to-video generation....
