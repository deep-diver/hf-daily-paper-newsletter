summary: This research focuses on improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) inference using the Sophon SG2042, a many-core open-source RISC-V CPU with vector processing capabilities. The study shows significant speedups for two LLMs, DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B and DeepSeek R1 Distill QWEN 14B, with up to 2.9x and 3.0x faster token generation and prompt processing respectively, compared to a baseline....
