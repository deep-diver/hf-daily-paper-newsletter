summary: The paper proposes MotiF, an approach to improve text alignment and motion generation in text-guided image animation by focusing on regions with more motion. They also introduce TI2V Bench, a dataset for evaluating text-guided image animation, and conduct a human evaluation protocol. MotiF outperforms nine open-sourced models on TI2V Bench, achieving an average preference of 72%....
