summary: We introduce a new way to use many language models together to solve complex problems, called LE-MCTS. This method helps open-source models perform better on challenging reasoning tasks by choosing the best answer from different models based on a reward system. Our approach outperforms other methods and improves performance by up to 4.3% on certain math reasoning datasets....
