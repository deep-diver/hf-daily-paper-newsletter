summary: We propose DiTCtrl, a method for generating videos with multiple sequential prompts using a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture. Our method analyzes the attention mechanism of MM-DiT and utilizes mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing to achieve smooth transitions and consistent object motion. We also introduce MPVBench, a new benchmark for evaluating multi-prompt video generation performance....
