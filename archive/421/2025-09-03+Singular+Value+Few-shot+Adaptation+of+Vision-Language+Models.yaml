summary: The authors propose CLIP-SVD, a new method for adapting vision-language models like CLIP to new domains using Singular Value Decomposition. This technique fine-tunes only a small portion of the model's parameters, improving adaptation performance and preserving generalization ability, resulting in state-of-the-art classification results on various datasets....
