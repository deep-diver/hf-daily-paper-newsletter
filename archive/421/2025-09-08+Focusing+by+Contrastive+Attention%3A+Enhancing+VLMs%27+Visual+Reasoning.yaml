summary: This study examines how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) process complex visual environments and finds that attention patterns within VLMs can be improved to enhance visual reasoning. The researchers propose a new, training-free method called CARVE, which uses contrasting attention to extract task-relevant visual signals, resulting in significant performance improvements on open-source models....
