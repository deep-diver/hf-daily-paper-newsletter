summary: 'The survey explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in training deep research systems, which are agentic AIs that tackle complex, multi-step tasks. It focuses on three main areas: data synthesis, RL methods for agentic research, and RL training systems, while also discussing agent architecture, evaluation, and benchmarks. The goal is to provide practical guidance for creating robust and transparent deep research agents using RL....'
