summary: This study presents a system called BFS-Prover-V2 that improves the training and inference processes of Large Language Models used in automated theorem proving. The system uses a new multi-stage reinforcement learning framework to enhance model performance during training and a multi-agent search architecture to improve reasoning capabilities during inference, leading to state-of-the-art results in formal mathematics benchmarks....
