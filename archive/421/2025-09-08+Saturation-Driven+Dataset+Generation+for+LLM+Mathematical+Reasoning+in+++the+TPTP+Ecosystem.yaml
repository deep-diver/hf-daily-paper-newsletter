summary: The authors address the lack of high-quality data for improving mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models by creating a scalable data engine using E-prover's saturation capabilities on the TPTP axiom library. This results in a large, error-free corpus of theorems, which are then transformed into three difficulty-controlled challenges to reveal and address a weakness in current models' deep, structural reasoning abilities....
