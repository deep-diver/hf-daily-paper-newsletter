summary: The study presents DCReg, a framework that effectively tackles the issue of inaccurate detection and resolution of ill-conditioned registration problems in LiDAR point cloud registration, particularly in degenerate or narrow environments. By employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix, DCReg decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and translational subspaces, enabling reliable ill-conditioning detection and targeted mitigation, resulting in improved localiza...
