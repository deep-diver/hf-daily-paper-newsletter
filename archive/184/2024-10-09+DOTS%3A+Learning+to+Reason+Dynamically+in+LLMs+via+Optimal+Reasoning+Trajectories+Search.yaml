summary: This paper introduces DOTS, a method that helps large language models reason better by finding the best way to think about each question. DOTS defines small thinking steps, tries out different ways to combine these steps for each question, and trains the model to plan its own thinking process. DOTS works better than just giving the model a fixed way to think and solves harder problems by thinking more deeply....
