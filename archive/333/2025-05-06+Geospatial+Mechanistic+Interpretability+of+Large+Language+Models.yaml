summary: The chapter presents a new framework for studying how Large Language Models process geographical information, using spatial analysis and probing techniques to understand their internal representations. Through experiments involving spatial autocorrelation and sparse autoencoders, the authors reveal spatial patterns related to geographic locations, offering insights into the models' handling of geospatial data....
