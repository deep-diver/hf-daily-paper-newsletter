summary: Vivid4D is an approach for improving 4D scene reconstruction from monocular videos by creating multiple views from a single one. It uses video inpainting to warp observed views into new viewpoints, trained on web videos with synthetically generated masks, and an iterative view augmentation strategy and robust reconstruction loss to minimize inaccuracies in monocular depth priors....
