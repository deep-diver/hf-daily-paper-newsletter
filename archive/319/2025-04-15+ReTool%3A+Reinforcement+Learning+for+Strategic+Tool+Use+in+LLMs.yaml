summary: ReTool is a method that improves long-form reasoning using computational tools. It interleaves real-time code execution with natural language reasoning and uses an automated RL paradigm to teach the model when and how to use tools. Experiments show that ReTool outperforms text-based RL baselines in efficiency and performance, even surpassing OpenAI's o1-preview by 27.9%....
