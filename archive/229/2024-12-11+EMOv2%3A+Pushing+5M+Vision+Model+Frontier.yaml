summary: This paper introduces a new type of lightweight model called EMOv2 that is designed for dense predictions and trades off parameters, FLOPs, and performance. The model is based on a unified perspective of lightweight CNNs and Transformers, and it improves on the previous EMO model by achieving higher accuracy and better performance on various vision recognition, dense prediction, and image generation tasks....
