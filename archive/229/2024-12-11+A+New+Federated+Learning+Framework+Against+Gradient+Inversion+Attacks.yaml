summary: A new federated learning framework, HyperFL, is introduced to protect against Gradient Inversion Attacks by breaking the connection between shared parameters and local private data. It uses hypernetworks to generate local model parameters and only shares the hypernetwork parameters. The framework is shown to be effective in protecting privacy while maintaining comparable performance....
