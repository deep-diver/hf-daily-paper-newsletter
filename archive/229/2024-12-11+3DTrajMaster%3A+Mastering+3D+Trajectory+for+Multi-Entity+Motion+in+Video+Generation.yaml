summary: This paper introduces a new method called 3DTrajMaster to manipulate multi-entity 3D motions in video generation. It uses 6DoF pose sequences to control the dynamics of entities in 3D space and uses a 3D-motion grounded object injector to fuse the entities with their respective 3D trajectories. The method also preserves the video diffusion prior and uses a domain adaptor to mitigate video quality degradation. The paper also introduces a new dataset called 360-Motion Dataset for training the meth...
