summary: This paper introduces ACDiT, a model that combines autoregressive modeling and diffusion to generate and understand visual information. It can be adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion, making it easy to implement and efficient during inference. The model is effective for image and video generation tasks and can be used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressiv...
