summary: DiTFlow is a method for transferring the motion of a reference video to a newly synthesized one, using Diffusion Transformers. It analyzes cross-frame attention maps, extracts a patch-wise motion signal, and guides the latent denoising process to generate videos that reproduce the reference motion. It also applies optimization strategy to transformer positional embeddings, boosting zero-shot motion transfer capabilities. DiTFlow outperforms other methods in various metrics and human evaluation....
