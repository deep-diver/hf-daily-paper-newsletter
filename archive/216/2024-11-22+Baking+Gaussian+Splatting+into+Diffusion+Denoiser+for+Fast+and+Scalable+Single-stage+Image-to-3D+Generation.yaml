summary: This paper introduces a new method called DiffusionGS for creating 3D images from 2D ones. It's faster and produces better results compared to other methods, and it can handle different view directions and object-centric inputs. The authors also developed a training strategy to improve the model's ability to generalize to different scenes and objects....
