summary: This paper proposes UltraMem, a new architecture that combines a large-scale, ultra-sparse memory layer to address the limitations of existing models. It significantly reduces inference latency while maintaining model performance and demonstrates favorable scaling properties. Experiments show that it achieves state-of-the-art inference speed and model performance within a given computational budget....
