summary: The paper proposes a method to identify 'vital layers' within Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, crucial for image formation, to perform consistent image edits via selective injection of attention features. The authors also introduce an improved image inversion method for flow models and evaluate their approach through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, along with a user study, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple applications....
