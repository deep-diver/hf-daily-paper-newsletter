summary: The paper proposes a method to generate 3D scenes from partial images, top view layouts, and text prompts. The method uses a pretrained text-to-image model and neural radiance fields to avoid creating large datasets. The use of a common representation of spatial information allows for multimodal condition interactions and reduces domain dependence of layout control....
