summary: This paper presents CosmicMan, a text-to-image foundation model specialized for generating high-fidelity human images. It uses a new data production paradigm called Annotate Anyone and a large-scale dataset, CosmicMan-HQ 1.0, to produce high-quality data. The model uses a Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework to tackle the misalignment problem and explicitly discretizes continuous text space into basic groups that align with human body structure to generate photo-realistic ...
