summary: The paper discusses the importance of high-quality data in pretraining language models, specifically in the code domain. They introduce Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B, a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks by using a data-efficient approach and refining the data quality through three phases of pretraining. The model outperforms other models trained on larger datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach....
