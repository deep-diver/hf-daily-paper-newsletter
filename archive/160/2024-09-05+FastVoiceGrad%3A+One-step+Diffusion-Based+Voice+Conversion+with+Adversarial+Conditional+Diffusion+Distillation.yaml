summary: FastVoiceGrad is a new one-step diffusion-based voice conversion method that improves speech quality and speaker similarity while reducing inference time compared to previous multi-step diffusion-based VC methods. It uses adversarial conditional diffusion distillation (ACDD) to train the model and achieves better or comparable VC performance to previous methods.
