summary: The authors propose Phased DMD, a new framework for distilling score-based generative models into efficient generators, addressing the limitations of previous methods. Phased DMD improves upon traditional distribution matching distillation by using progressive distribution matching and score matching within subintervals, resulting in better output diversity and retaining key generative capabilities....
