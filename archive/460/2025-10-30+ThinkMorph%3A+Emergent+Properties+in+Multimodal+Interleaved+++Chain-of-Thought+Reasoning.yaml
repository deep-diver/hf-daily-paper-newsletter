summary: The study presents ThinkMorph, a model that improves multimodal reasoning by generating progressive text-image steps that manipulate visual content and maintain verbal logic. ThinkMorph significantly outperforms base models on vision-centric benchmarks and demonstrates emergent multimodal intelligence, such as unseen visual manipulation skills and adaptive switching between reasoning modes....
