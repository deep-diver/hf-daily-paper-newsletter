summary: The study presents a new method called Spatial-SSRL, which improves large vision-language models' spatial understanding without relying on expensive or limited supervision. By using RGB or RGB-D images, Spatial-SSRL creates five pretext tasks that help models understand 2D and 3D structures, leading to better spatial reasoning and higher performance on various benchmarks....
