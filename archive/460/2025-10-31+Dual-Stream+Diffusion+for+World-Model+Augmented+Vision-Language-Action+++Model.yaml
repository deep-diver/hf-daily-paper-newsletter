summary: The authors present a new framework called DUST for improving Vision-Language-Action models in robotic policy learning by addressing the challenge of predicting next-state observations and action sequences. DUST uses a multimodal diffusion transformer architecture with separate modality streams, independent noise perturbations, and a decoupled flow-matching loss to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional manner, resulting in improved performance on simulated and real-world tasks compared...
