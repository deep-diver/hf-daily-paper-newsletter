summary: D-Flow is a new framework that controls the generation process by differentiating
  through the flow, optimizing for the source point. This helps solve inverse problems,
  conditional generation, and controlled generation in general, and is validated on
  various image and audio inverse problems, as well as conditional molecule generation
  tasks....
