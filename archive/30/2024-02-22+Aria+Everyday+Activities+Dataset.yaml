summary: This research paper presents the Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) dataset,
  which includes multimodal sensor data, machine perception data, and high frequency
  globally aligned 3D trajectories. The data was recorded using Project Aria glasses
  and includes daily activity sequences recorded in five different indoor locations.
  This dataset can be used for research applications like neural scene reconstruction
  and prompted segmentation, and is available for download from projectaria.com....
