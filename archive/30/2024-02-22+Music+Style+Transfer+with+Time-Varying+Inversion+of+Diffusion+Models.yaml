summary: This paper proposes a method for music style transfer using diffusion models
  and a time-varying textual inversion module, which can accurately capture musical
  attributes and transfer styles of specific instruments, even with limited data.
  The method also includes a bias-reduced stylization technique for stable results.
  Results and source code are available at the provided link....
