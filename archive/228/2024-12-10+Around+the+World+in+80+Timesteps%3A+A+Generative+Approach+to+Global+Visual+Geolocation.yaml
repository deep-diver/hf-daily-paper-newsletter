summary: The paper introduces a new approach to global visual geolocation using diffusion and Riemannian flow matching, which is the first of its kind. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three visual geolocation benchmarks and introduces a new task of probabilistic visual geolocation, demonstrating the advantages of the diffusion-based approach....
