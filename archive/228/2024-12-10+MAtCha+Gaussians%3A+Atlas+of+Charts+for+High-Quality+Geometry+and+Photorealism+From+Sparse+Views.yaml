summary: This paper introduces a new way to create 3D models and images that look real using just a few pictures. It does this by using a special kind of 2D shape called a Gaussian surfel, which helps to keep the 3D model looking good and the images looking real at the same time. This method is better than what we have now because it uses fewer pictures and takes less time to work....
