summary: The paper suggests that combining multiple checkpoints of large language models can improve performance and make better use of resources by recycling suboptimal models. The algorithm used to combine these checkpoints results in a Pareto-optimal model that outperforms individual models and merge-based baselines. Even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges....
