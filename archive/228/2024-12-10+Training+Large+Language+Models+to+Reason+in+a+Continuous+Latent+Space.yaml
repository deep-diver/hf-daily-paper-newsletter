summary: This paper proposes a new paradigm called Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought) that enables large language models to reason in a continuous latent space instead of using natural language. By utilizing the last hidden state of the LLM as a representation of the reasoning state, Coconut can effectively augment the LLM on several reasoning tasks and allow the model to perform a breadth-first search to solve the problem. Coconut outperforms the traditional chain-of-thought method in certain logical...
