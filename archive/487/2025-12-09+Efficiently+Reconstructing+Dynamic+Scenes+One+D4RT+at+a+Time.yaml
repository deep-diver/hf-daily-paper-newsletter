summary: This research presents a new model called D4RT, which is a unified transformer architecture that efficiently reconstructs dynamic scenes from video by inferring depth, motion, and camera parameters all at once. Its unique querying mechanism reduces computation and complexity, enabling fast training and inference, and it outperforms previous methods in 4D reconstruction tasks....
