summary: ThreadWeaver is a new framework that improves the efficiency of language models by allowing them to reason in parallel, reducing latency without sacrificing accuracy. It does this through a two-stage parallel trajectory generator, a trie-based training-inference co-design, and a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework, making it compatible with existing inference engines and achieving up to 1.53x speedup in token latency....
