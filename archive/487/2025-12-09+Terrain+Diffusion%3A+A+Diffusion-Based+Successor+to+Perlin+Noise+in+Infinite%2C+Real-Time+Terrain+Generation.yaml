summary: The authors present Terrain Diffusion, an improvement over Perlin noise for creating infinite, realistic terrains in real-time. It uses a new algorithm called InfiniteDiffusion, a stack of diffusion models for detail and context, and an open-source framework for handling large data, enabling the generation of entire planets seamlessly and coherently....
