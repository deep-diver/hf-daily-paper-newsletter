summary: The authors present a new method called TrackingWorld that improves monocular 3D tracking by separating camera motion from foreground motion and densely tracking new subjects. They achieve this through a tracking upsampler, reducing redundancy in 2D tracks, and an optimization-based framework for back-projecting dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories, resulting in more accurate and dense 3D tracking....
