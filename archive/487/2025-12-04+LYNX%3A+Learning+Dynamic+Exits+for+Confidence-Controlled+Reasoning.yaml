summary: The study presents LYNX, a new method that helps reasoning models stop processing when they have enough information, improving efficiency and accuracy. LYNX uses a model's internal signals and a lightweight probe trained on mathematical tasks to make confident decisions, reducing tokens by 35-70% while maintaining or improving accuracy across various benchmarks....
