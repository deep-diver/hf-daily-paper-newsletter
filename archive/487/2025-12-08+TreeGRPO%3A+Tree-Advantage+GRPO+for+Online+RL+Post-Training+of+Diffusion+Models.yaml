summary: The study presents a new framework called TreeGRPO that significantly enhances the efficiency of reinforcement learning for improving generative models. By structuring the denoising process as a search tree, TreeGRPO increases sample efficiency, allows for more precise reward assignment, and reduces computation costs, leading to faster training and better performance compared to existing methods....
