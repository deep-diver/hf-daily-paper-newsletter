summary: This paper proposes a method called aTLAS that combines different parameter blocks with different learned coefficients, resulting in anisotropic scaling at the task vector level. This method is shown to be effective in task arithmetic, few-shot recognition, and test-time adaptation, and it can reduce the dependency on large amounts of data. The method also allows for better generalizability, especially with scarce or no labeled data, and it can reduce the memory footprint and improve the flexibi...
