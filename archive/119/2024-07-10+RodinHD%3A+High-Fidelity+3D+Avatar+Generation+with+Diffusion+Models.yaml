summary: RodinHD is a method that generates high-quality 3D avatars from a portrait image. It addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting in existing methods by using a new data scheduling strategy and a weight consolidation regularization term. It also improves the guiding effect of the portrait image by computing a finer-grained hierarchical representation and injecting it into the 3D diffusion model at multiple layers....
