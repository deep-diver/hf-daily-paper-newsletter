summary: Video-STaR is a self-training approach that improves video instruction tuning in Large Vision Language Models by utilizing existing labeled video datasets as weak supervision. By generating and filtering answers based on video labels, Video-STaR enhances general video understanding and adapts LVLMs to novel downstream tasks, resulting in improved performance in video QA and downstream tasks like Kinetics700-QA and FineDiving....
