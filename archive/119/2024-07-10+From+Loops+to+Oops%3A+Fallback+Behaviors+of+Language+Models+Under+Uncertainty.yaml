summary: This paper investigates the fallback behaviors of large language models when facing uncertainty, such as sequence repetitions, degenerate text, and hallucinations. The study reveals a clear and consistent ordering of fallback behaviors across different models, with more advanced models shifting from sequence repetitions to degenerate text and then to hallucinations as uncertainty increases. The study also finds that common decoding techniques can alleviate some unwanted behaviors but may increas...
