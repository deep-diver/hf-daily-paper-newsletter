summary: AdaSPEC is a new method that improves the performance of Speculative Decoding, a technique that speeds up large language model inference. It does this by selectively filtering out difficult-to-fit tokens during the Knowledge Distillation process, resulting in a draft model that better aligns with the target model and improves the overall token acceptance rate without sacrificing quality....
