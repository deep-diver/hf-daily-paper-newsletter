summary: This study explores how factors like hidden size, mlp-to-attention ratio, and grouped-query attention affect the efficiency and accuracy of large language models (LLMs). They developed a conditional scaling law to predict the best architectural choices, resulting in models that are more accurate and efficient compared to existing open-source baselines....
