summary: The study presents a new method called Search Self-play (SSP) that improves the capability of learning LLM agents in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) without requiring massive human efforts. SSP allows agents to act as both task proposers and problem solvers, enabling them to generate search queries, find accurate answers, and improve their performance through competition and cooperation, as demonstrated by experimental results on various benchmarks....
