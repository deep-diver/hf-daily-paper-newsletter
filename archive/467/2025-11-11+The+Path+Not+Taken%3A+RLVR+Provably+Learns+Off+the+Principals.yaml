summary: The study explores why Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves large language models with minimal parameter changes. It introduces the Three-Gate Theory to explain how RLVR focuses on specific parameter regions, resulting in consistent performance gains without significantly altering the model's spectrum, unlike Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The research highlights RLVR's unique optimization regime and suggests a need for new, geometry-aware learning algorithms tailored fo...
