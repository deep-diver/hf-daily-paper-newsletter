summary: The authors present BiCA, a method for improving biomedical dense retrieval by using citation-aware hard negatives, which are documents referenced in the source document. By fine-tuning GTE models with these negatives, they achieve better zero-shot dense retrieval results and outperform baselines on specific benchmarks, demonstrating an efficient way to adapt to new domains....
