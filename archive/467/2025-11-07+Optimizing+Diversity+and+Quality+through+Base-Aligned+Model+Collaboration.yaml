summary: The authors present a new method called BACo that improves diversity and quality of large language model outputs during inference by combining a base LLM with its aligned version. BACo uses routing strategies to determine which model to decode from at each token, based on prediction uncertainty and semantic role, and consistently outperforms other methods in various tasks and metrics, achieving a 21.3% joint improvement in diversity and quality....
