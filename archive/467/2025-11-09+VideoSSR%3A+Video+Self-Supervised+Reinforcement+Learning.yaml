summary: This research explores utilizing the inherent information in videos to create high-quality training data for multimodal large language models (MLLM) without manual annotation. The authors propose three self-supervised pretext tasks and a new dataset, introducing a reinforcement learning framework called VideoSSR, which significantly improves video understanding in MLLMs, outperforming existing methods by an average of over 5%....
