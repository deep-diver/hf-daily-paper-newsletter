summary: The authors present a new method called KLASS that speeds up the generation process in masked diffusion models by using token-level KL divergence to identify stable predictions, without needing additional model training. This results in faster inference times and improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, as well as demonstrating effectiveness across various domains such as text, image, and molecular generation....
