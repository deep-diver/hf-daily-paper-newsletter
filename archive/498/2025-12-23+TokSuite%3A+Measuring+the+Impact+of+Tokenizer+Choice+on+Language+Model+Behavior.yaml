summary: The study presents TokSuite, a set of models and a benchmark designed to investigate the impact of tokenizers on language models' performance and behavior. By training fourteen models with different tokenizers but identical architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization, and creating a new benchmark for measuring model performance under real-world perturbations, TokSuite enables researchers to understand the advantages and limitations of various popular tokenizers....
