summary: This research presents Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a module that enhances iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge before planning. EKA improves retrieval precision, reduces errors, and boosts performance and efficiency by focusing on relevant information subsets, making it a versatile and scalable strategy for large models....
