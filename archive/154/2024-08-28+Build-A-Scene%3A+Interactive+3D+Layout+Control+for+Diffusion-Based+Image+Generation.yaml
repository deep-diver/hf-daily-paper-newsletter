summary: This paper introduces a new approach for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation that allows users to control the 3D layout of objects in the image. Unlike previous methods, this approach lets users make changes to the layout after the image has been generated, making it useful for applications like interior design and complex scene generation. The approach also improves the success rate of generating objects in the image by 2x compared to traditional methods....
