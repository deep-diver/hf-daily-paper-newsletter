summary: The paper proposes a method to create video sequences with smooth motion between two input frames. It uses a pre-trained image-to-video model and fine-tunes it to generate videos moving backwards in time from a single input image. The model is then used in a dual-directional diffusion sampling process to combine overlapping model estimates. The method outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and traditional frame interpolation techniques....
