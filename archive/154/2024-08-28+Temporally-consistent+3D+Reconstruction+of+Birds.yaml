summary: This paper presents a method to reconstruct the 3D pose and shape of seabirds from monocular videos. The method includes detection, tracking, segmentation, and temporally consistent 3D reconstruction. The paper also introduces a real-world dataset of seabird videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging sequences in the dataset....
