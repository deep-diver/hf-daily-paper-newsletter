summary: The paper introduces a text-conditioned generative model for creating realistic and controllable 3D avatars. This model can generate avatars with more complete details and can be driven through a powerful non-parametric latent expression space. The model can also generate and control high-fidelity avatars, even those out-of-distribution. The potential for downstream applications, including avatar editing and single-shot avatar reconstruction, is also highlighted....
