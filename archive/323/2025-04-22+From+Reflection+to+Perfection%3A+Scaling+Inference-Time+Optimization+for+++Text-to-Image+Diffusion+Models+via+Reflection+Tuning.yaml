summary: The researchers propose a new framework called ReflectionFlow that allows text-to-image diffusion models to improve their outputs by reflecting on and refining them, using a large-scale dataset named GenRef. This method significantly enhances image quality, especially for complex and detailed scenes, by introducing three inference-time scaling axes and efficiently performing reflection tuning on a state-of-the-art diffusion model....
