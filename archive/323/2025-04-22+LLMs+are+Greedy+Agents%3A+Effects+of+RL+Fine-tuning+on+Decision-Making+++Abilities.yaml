summary: This study explores why large language models (LLMs) often make poor decisions and finds that they struggle with exploring options, are influenced by frequency, and have a gap between knowing and doing. The researchers improve LLMs' decision-making by fine-tuning with reinforcement learning on self-generated reasoning steps, resulting in better exploration and reduced knowing-doing gap....
