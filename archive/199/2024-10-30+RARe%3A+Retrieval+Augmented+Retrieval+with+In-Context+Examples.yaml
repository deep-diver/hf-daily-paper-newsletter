summary: We propose a method called RARe to improve the performance of embedding models in retrieval tasks by using in-context examples. By finetuning a pre-trained model with in-context examples whose query is similar to the target query, we achieve performance gains of up to +2.72% nDCG across various open-domain retrieval datasets. RARe exhibits stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to models using queries without in-context examples, similar to what is seen for in-context learning in LLMs. W...
