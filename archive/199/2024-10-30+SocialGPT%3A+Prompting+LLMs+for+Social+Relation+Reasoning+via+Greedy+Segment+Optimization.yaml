summary: SocialGPT is a method for social relation reasoning that uses Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze images and generate text-based reasoning. It introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers. The method also introduces Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a g...
