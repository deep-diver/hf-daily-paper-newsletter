summary: This research explores how to use larger decoder-only models and visual information to improve the efficiency and performance of extreme multi-label classification (XMC). The proposed Vision-enhanced eXtreme Multi-label Learning framework (ViXML) integrates foundation vision models to unlock multi-modal capabilities while limiting computational growth, outperforming text-only decoder models in most cases....
