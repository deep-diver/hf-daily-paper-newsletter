summary: This study presents a novel method for improving 3D grounding in language models by creating precise visual counterfactuals through scene editing. The proposed DEER-3D framework identifies and corrects specific errors in the model, enhancing its spatial understanding and grounding accuracy without requiring extensive 3D data collection or scene reconstruction....
