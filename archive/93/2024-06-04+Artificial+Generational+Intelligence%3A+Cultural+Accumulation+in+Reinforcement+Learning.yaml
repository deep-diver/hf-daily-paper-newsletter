summary: 'The paper introduces a new approach to reinforcement learning that allows learning agents to accumulate culture over generations, similar to how humans have done throughout history. The authors find that this approach leads to better performance than traditional reinforcement learning methods, and they explore two models of cultural accumulation: in-context learning and in-weights learning....'
