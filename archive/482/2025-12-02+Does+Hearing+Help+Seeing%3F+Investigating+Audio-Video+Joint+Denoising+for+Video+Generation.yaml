summary: This study explores whether training a model to denoise both audio and video together can enhance video generation quality. By using a new architecture that combines pre-trained text-to-video and text-to-audio models, the researchers found that audio-video joint denoising not only improves synchrony but also video quality, especially for complex motions. The results suggest that incorporating audio as a signal helps the model understand the cause-and-effect relationships between visual events an...
