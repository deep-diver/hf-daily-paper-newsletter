summary: The authors present PixelDiT, a new model for image generation that doesn't require a two-stage pipeline with a pretrained autoencoder, which can introduce errors. Instead, PixelDiT is a single-stage, end-to-end transformer-based model that learns directly in the pixel space, achieving better results on ImageNet 256x256 compared to existing pixel generative models and also performing well in text-to-image generation at higher resolutions....
