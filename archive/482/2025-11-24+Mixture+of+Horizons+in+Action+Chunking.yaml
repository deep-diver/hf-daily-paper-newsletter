summary: The study finds that VLA models for robotic manipulation have a trade-off between long and short action chunk lengths, leading to suboptimal performance. The proposed solution, Mixture of Horizons (MoH), combines different action chunk lengths within a single model, improving both performance and generalizability, and enabling efficient in-time horizon selection....
