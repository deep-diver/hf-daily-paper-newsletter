summary: The authors present a new simulation environment for research on GUI agent navigation, which allows for flexible design and access to environment information. They experiment with supervised fine-tuning, single-turn, and multi-turn reinforcement learning, finding that each step improves the agent's performance in navigating screens, with reinforcement learning showing particular advantages....
