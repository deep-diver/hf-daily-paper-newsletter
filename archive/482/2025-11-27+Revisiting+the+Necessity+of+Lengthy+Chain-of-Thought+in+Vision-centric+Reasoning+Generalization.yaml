summary: The study investigates how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs impact visual reasoning in vision-language models, focusing on a maze-solving benchmark. The experiments reveal that shorter CoT with essential grounding steps outperforms longer CoT and generalizes better across different maze sizes, highlighting a 'short is long' effect....
