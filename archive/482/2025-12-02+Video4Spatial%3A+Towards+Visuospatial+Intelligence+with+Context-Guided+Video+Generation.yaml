summary: The authors propose a new framework, Video4Spatial, which uses video diffusion models to perform complex spatial tasks like scene navigation and object grounding, all from video-only inputs. This framework demonstrates strong spatial understanding and generalization, bringing video generative models closer to human-like visuospatial reasoning....
