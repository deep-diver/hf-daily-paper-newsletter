summary: This study examines how large language models (LLMs) use analogical reasoning, which is crucial for human cognition. The researchers found that while LLMs can encode relationships between analogous entities, they struggle to apply this information to new situations, and success in analogical reasoning depends on strong structural alignment between situations....
