summary: We present Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to control large generative models by steering their activations. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over model behavior with minimal computational overhead and impact on model abilities. We demonstrate AcT's effectiveness and versatility in controlling language models and text-to-image diffusion models to mitigate toxicity, induce concepts, increase truthfulness, and enable fine-grained style control....
