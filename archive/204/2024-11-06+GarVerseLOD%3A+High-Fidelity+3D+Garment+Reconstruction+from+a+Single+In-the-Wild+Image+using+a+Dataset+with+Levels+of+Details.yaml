summary: GarVerseLOD is a new dataset and framework that improves the accuracy of 3D garment reconstruction from a single unconstrained image by using a large amount of high-quality 3D garment data with different levels of detail. It also uses a novel labeling paradigm based on conditional diffusion models to generate paired images for each garment model with high photorealism. Experimental results show that GarVerseLOD can generate standalone garment pieces with significantly better quality than prior a...
