summary: This paper introduces LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, a new method for enhancing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to handle multiple images, videos, and 3D data simultaneously. The method uses an interleaved data format and a new dataset called M4-Instruct with 1,177.6k samples. The authors also created a benchmark to evaluate the performance of LMMs in multi-image scenarios. LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading results in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks while maintaining performance in single-imag...
