summary: 'This paper introduces a robot learning method called This&That that uses language and gestures to control video generation for robot planning. The method addresses three challenges: unambiguous task communication, controllable video generation, and translating visual planning into robot actions. The paper proposes language-gesture conditioning to generate videos and a behavioral cloning design to incorporate video plans. This&That demonstrates state-of-the-art effectiveness in addressing these c...'
