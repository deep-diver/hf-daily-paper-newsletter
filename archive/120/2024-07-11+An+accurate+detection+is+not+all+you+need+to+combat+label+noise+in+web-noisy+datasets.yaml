summary: This paper discusses how to improve the accuracy of classifiers trained on web-crawled data, which often contains annotation errors and irrelevant examples. The paper proposes a hybrid solution that combines a linear separation method with a state-of-the-art small-loss approach to detect and remove noise from the data. This approach improves the accuracy of real-world image classification in the presence of web noise....
