summary: The paper presents UltraGen, a new video generation framework that allows for efficient and end-to-end high-resolution video synthesis, addressing the computational bottleneck of existing models by using a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture and spatially compressed global modeling strategy, enabling the generation of 1080P and even 4K resolution videos for the first time....
