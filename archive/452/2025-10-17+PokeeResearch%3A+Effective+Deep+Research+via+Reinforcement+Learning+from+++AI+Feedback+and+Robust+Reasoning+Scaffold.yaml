summary: The study presents PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent that uses a unified reinforcement learning framework to improve its robustness, alignment, and scalability. This agent outperforms other 7B-scale deep research agents in 10 popular benchmarks by using an annotation-free reinforcement learning framework and a chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold for self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool failures....
