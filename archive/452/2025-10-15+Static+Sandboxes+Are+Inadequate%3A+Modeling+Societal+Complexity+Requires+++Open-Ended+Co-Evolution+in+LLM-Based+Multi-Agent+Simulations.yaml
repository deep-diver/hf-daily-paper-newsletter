summary: This study discusses the limitations of current AI simulations that are confined to static environments and proposes a new approach using LLMs in multi-agent systems to model complex, ever-changing societies. The authors introduce a taxonomy for this field and present a research roadmap focused on creating adaptive, socially-aware AI ecosystems through open-ended co-evolution....
