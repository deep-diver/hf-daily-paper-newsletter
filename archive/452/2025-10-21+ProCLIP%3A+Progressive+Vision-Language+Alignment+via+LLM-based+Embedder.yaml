summary: The authors present a new method called ProCLIP to improve the alignment between an LLM-based embedder and the CLIP image encoder. ProCLIP overcomes limitations of the original CLIP text encoder by leveraging the LLM's ability to process long texts and multiple languages, while also ensuring that the vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder is not disrupted....
