summary: The study presents SciRecipe, a large dataset of structured biological protocols, and introduces the 'Sketch-and-Fill' paradigm to improve protocol generation. They develop Thoth, a model trained to generate accurate and executable protocols, which outperforms existing models in various benchmarks, thus enhancing the efficiency of scientific experiment reproduction....
