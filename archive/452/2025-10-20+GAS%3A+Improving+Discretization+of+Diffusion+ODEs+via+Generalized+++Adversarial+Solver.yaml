summary: The authors propose a new method called Generalized Adversarial Solver to improve the efficiency of diffusion models in generating high-quality samples. This method simplifies the training process and enhances fine-grained details by combining the original distillation loss with adversarial training, resulting in better performance compared to existing solver training methods....
