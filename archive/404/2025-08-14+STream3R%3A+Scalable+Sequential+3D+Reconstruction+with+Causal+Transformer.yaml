summary: The researchers developed a new method called STream3R for 3D reconstruction that uses a Transformer model to predict point maps, which is more efficient than existing methods that require complex calculations or don't handle long sequences well. STream3R can generalize to various scenarios, including dynamic scenes, and can be trained and fine-tuned using large-scale datasets, making it suitable for real-time 3D perception in streaming environments....
