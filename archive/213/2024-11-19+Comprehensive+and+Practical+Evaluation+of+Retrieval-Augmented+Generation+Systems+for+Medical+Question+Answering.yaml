summary: This paper introduces MedRGB, a comprehensive evaluation framework for medical question-answering systems using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The framework tests LLMs' ability to handle specific scenarios in the medical domain, including sufficiency, integration, and robustness. The results show that current models struggle with noise and misinformation in retrieved documents, providing valuable insights for future RAG development in the medical field....
