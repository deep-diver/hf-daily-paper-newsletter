summary: The paper introduces BlueLM-V-3B, an algorithm and system co-design approach for efficiently deploying multimodal large language models on mobile devices. It optimizes model inference by redesigning the dynamic resolution scheme and implementing system optimization for hardware-aware deployment. BlueLM-V-3B has 2.7B parameters for the language model and 400M parameters for the vision encoder, achieving a generation speed of 24.4 token/s on the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor with 4-bit LLM wei...
