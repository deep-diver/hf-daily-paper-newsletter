summary: Adaptive Decoding is a method that dynamically adjusts the sampling temperature during language model decoding to improve performance. It uses Latent Preference Optimization (LPO) to train discrete latent variables such as the choice of temperature. This method outperforms fixed decoding temperatures across a range of tasks that require different temperatures, such as UltraFeedback, Creative Story Writing, and GSM8K....
