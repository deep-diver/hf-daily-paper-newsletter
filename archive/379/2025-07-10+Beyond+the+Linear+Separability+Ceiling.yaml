summary: This study explores why visual-language models struggle with abstract reasoning tasks, attributing it to a 'linear reasoning bottleneck' in their visual embeddings. The researchers propose that this issue can be solved by either activating existing pathways or adapting core model weights, depending on the task, and suggest that targeted alignment is key to improving reasoning abilities in these models....
