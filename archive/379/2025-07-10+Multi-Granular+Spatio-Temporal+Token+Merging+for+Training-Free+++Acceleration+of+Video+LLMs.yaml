summary: The authors propose a new method called STTM to reduce the computational cost of video large language models by merging spatio-temporal tokens without the need for retraining. STTM improves performance and reduces computation time by exploiting redundancy in video data, outperforming existing methods and allowing for query-agnostic KV cache reuse....
