summary: LangSplatV2 is a new method that significantly speeds up and improves the accuracy of embedding 2D language features into 3D spaces, making it possible for real-time language interaction in complex scenes. It does this by learning a sparse coefficient field and using efficient splatting methods, resulting in a major boost in performance compared to the original LangSplat....
