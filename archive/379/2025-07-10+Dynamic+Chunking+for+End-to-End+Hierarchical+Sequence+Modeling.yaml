summary: This study presents new techniques for a dynamic chunking mechanism that learns content and context-dependent segmentation strategies, replacing the traditional tokenization-LM-detokenization pipeline with a single, fully end-to-end learned model. The proposed hierarchical network (H-Net) demonstrates improved performance over strong transformer language models, especially in languages and modalities with weaker tokenization heuristics, and shows increased character-level robustness and better s...
