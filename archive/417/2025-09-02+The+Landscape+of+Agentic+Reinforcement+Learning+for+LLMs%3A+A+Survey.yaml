summary: This survey explores the shift from traditional reinforcement learning in large language models to agentic reinforcement learning, where models become autonomous decision-makers in complex environments. It presents a two-part taxonomy of agentic capabilities and applications, emphasizing reinforcement learning's role in creating adaptive behavior, and provides a comprehensive resource for future research in this field....
