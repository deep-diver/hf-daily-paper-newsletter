summary: The study investigates ten deep learning optimizers across various model scales and data-to-model ratios, revealing that fair comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations. It finds that while some optimizers claim faster training, their actual speedup is lower than expected, especially for larger models, and that the fastest optimizers use matrices as preconditioners, but this speedup decreases with model size....
