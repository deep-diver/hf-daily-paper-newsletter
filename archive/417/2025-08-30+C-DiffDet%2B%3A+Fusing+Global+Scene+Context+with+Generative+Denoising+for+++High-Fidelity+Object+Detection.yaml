summary: The study presents a new method called Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) that improves fine-grained object detection, like identifying vehicle damage, by combining global scene context with local features. CAF uses cross-attention mechanisms and a dedicated encoder to capture and integrate comprehensive environmental information, enhancing the generative detection paradigm and outperforming state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark....
