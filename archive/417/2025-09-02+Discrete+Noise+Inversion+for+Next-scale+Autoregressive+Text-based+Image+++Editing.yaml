summary: This research presents a new method called VARIN that allows for precise and controllable image editing using visual autoregressive models, which are a type of AI model for generating images from text. The method, which uses a special technique to reverse the noise in the images, enables users to make targeted changes to images based on text descriptions while preserving the original background and details....
