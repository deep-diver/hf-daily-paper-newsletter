summary: The study presents LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal model that challenges the conventional separation between critic and policy models in vision-language tasks. By reorganizing preference-labeled critic datasets and performing reinforcement learning on a base generative model, LLaVA-Critic-R1 excels as both a critic and a competitive policy model, outperforming specialized reasoning VLMs across various benchmarks. Furthermore, the model's enhanced critic ability improves inference, leading to a sim...
