summary: The authors present a new method called Genetic Prompt that improves synthetic data generation by combining genetic algorithms with large language models. This approach treats text attributes as genes and uses the language model to create new combinations, enhancing data quality and diversity, and improving downstream model performance, especially in class-imbalanced scenarios....
