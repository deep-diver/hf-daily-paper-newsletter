summary: This paper presents InstaGen, a new method that uses a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for improving object detection. By adding a grounding head to the diffusion model, it can localize instances in the generated images. With experiments showing superior performance, InstaGen helps enhance detection performance, particularly for open-vocabulary and data-sparse scenarios....
