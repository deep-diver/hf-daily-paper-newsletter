summary: This paper shows that a type of learning called offline actor-critic reinforcement learning can be used to train large models, such as transformers, and that it can outperform supervised learning in certain tasks. They introduce a new Perceiver-based actor-critic model and find that it works well with self- and cross-attention modules. The paper suggests that offline actor-critic algorithms are a good choice for multi-task training and that it is possible to learn multi-task policies from sub-op...
