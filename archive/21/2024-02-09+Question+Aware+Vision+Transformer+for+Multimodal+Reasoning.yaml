summary: The paper proposes QA-ViT, an approach that incorporates question awareness into the vision encoder of a multimodal reasoning model. This results in dynamic visual features that focus on relevant aspects of the image in response to the posed question. QA-ViT is efficient and applies to various models, significantly improving their performance across various tasks....
