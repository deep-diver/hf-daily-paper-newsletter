summary: The authors present Seed-Prover, a model that uses a formal verification language called Lean to improve its theorem proving abilities through iterative refinement and self-summarization. Seed-Prover, along with a geometry reasoning engine, achieves high success rates in solving advanced mathematical problems and even fully proves 5 out of 6 IMO 2025 problems, marking a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning....
