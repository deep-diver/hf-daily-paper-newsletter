summary: This research explores machine unlearning, a method for models to forget specific training data, and introduces a new algorithm called Influence Approximation Unlearning (IAU). IAU efficiently handles data deletion requests by connecting unlearning to incremental learning, offering a better balance of removal guarantee, unlearning efficiency, and model utility compared to existing methods....
