summary: The study presents a new method called NeRF-GS that combines Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve 3D scene representation. By sharing spatial information and optimizing both representations together, NeRF-GS outperforms existing methods and demonstrates that NeRF and 3DGS can work well together....
