summary: The study explores how Reinforcement Learning (RL) can improve the spatial reasoning and interaction abilities of visuomotor agents in 3D environments, specifically in Minecraft. They propose automated task synthesis and a distributed RL framework for large-scale multi-task training, resulting in a 4x boost in interaction success rates and zero-shot generalization across diverse environments....
