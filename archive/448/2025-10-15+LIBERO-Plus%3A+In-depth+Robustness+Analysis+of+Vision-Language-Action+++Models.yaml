summary: The study examines the robustness of robotic manipulation models by testing their performance under various controlled conditions, such as changes in camera angles, lighting, and language instructions. The results show that these models are highly sensitive to certain factors and can perform poorly even with minor changes, while being surprisingly unaffected by others, indicating that high benchmark scores may not accurately reflect their true competency....
