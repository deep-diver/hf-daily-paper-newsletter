summary: The research presents a tool called HFTP that uses frequency analysis to understand how large language models and the human brain process syntax. The study finds that while language models and the brain have some similarities in syntax processing, advanced models may rely on different mechanisms than the brain, offering new insights into the interpretability of model improvements....
