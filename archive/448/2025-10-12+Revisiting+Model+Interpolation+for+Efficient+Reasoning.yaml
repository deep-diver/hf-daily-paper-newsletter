summary: The study examines a straightforward method of combining two models, called model interpolation, and discovers it follows a three-stage evolution with unique behaviors that help balance performance and cost. Experiments show that this interpolated model outperforms more complex merging methods, and further tests confirm the findings, providing a practical guide for creating models with specific reasoning skills....
