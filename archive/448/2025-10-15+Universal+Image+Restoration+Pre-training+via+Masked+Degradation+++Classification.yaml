summary: The researchers present a new method called Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training (MaskDCPT) for training models to restore images. This method uses the type of image degradation as a weak form of guidance and helps improve the model's performance and robustness. The pre-trained model can then be used for various image restoration tasks and significantly outperforms existing methods on different restoration tasks....
