summary: The study presents Hard2Verify, a benchmark for evaluating the step-level verification of open-ended mathematical reasoning by large language models. The benchmark, created with extensive human labor, assesses the ability of verifiers to identify mistakes in responses generated by advanced LLMs, and the results show that closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones, with further analysis on the factors affecting verification performance....
