summary: The research proposes a new method called Soft Prompt, which uses minimal additional parameters and separate learnable embeddings for each data source to improve generalist Vision-Language-Action models. This approach, implemented in the X-VLA architecture, enables effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various simulations and real-world robots....
