summary: This study presents Latent-Trajectory signals, which predict the success of reasoning paths in models by analyzing changes in their internal representations. These signals allow for more efficient and effective answer selection during inference, reducing token usage by up to 70% and improving accuracy by 2.6% on average compared to majority voting, by identifying promising candidates early in the reasoning process....
