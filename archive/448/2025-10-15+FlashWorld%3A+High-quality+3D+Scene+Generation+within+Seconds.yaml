summary: The authors present a new model, FlashWorld, that creates high-quality 3D scenes quickly from images or text, improving upon previous methods by being faster and more realistic. They achieve this by combining the strengths of two approaches, using a video model to pre-train and a distribution matching method to enhance visual quality, resulting in a model that is efficient and generalizable....
