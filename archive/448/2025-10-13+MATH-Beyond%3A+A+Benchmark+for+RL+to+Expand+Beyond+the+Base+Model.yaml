summary: The authors present MATH-Beyond, a new math benchmark designed to challenge current RL methods and encourage the discovery of new reasoning skills beyond existing models' capabilities. The benchmark consists of harder math problems that existing RL fine-tuned models struggle to solve, aiming to stimulate the development of more advanced RL techniques....
