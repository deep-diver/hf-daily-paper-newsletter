summary: This study analyzes the trade-offs of parallel decoding in diffusion LLMs, revealing that they can have significantly reduced performance in real-world tasks compared to autoregressive LLMs due to ignoring token dependencies. The research introduces ParallelBench, a new benchmark for diffusion LLMs, which highlights the need for improved decoding methods to balance speed and quality....
