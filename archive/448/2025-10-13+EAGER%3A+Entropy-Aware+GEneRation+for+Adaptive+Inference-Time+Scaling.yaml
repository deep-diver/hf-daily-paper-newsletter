summary: The proposed method, EAGer, reduces unnecessary computation and enhances performance by utilizing model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution for adaptive inference-time scaling. EAGer selectively branches to multiple reasoning paths in high-entropy areas, reallocating saved computational resources to more complex prompts, resulting in significant efficiency and performance improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks....
