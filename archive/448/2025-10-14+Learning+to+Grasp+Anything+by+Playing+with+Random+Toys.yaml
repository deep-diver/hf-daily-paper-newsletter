summary: The study explores how robots can learn to grasp various objects by interacting with simple toys made from basic shapes. The findings suggest that robots can achieve strong zero-shot performance on real-world objects by training with these toys, thanks to an object-centric visual representation. The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the YCB dataset, demonstrating a promising approach for scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation....
