summary: The study reveals that large language models can detect errors in user input but struggle to correct their own mistakes, a phenomenon named the 'Self-Correction Blind Spot'. The authors propose a framework to measure this issue and find that most models have a significant blind spot rate, which may be linked to the way they are trained. They also suggest a simple trick to significantly reduce this blind spot, emphasizing the need for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of current langu...
