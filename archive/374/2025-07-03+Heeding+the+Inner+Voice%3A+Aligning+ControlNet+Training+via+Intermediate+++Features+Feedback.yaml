summary: The authors present InnerControl, a new training strategy for text-to-image models that ensures consistent spatial control throughout the entire generation process. By using lightweight convolutional probes to extract input control signals from intermediate model features, InnerControl improves control accuracy and overall image quality, outperforming existing methods like ControlNet and ControlNet++....
