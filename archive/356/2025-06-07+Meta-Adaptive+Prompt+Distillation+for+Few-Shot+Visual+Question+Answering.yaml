summary: The study presents a new method for improving few-shot learning in large multimodal models, which often struggle with inconsistent performance in smaller models. The proposed approach uses a fixed set of soft prompts adapted from task-relevant image features, allowing for efficient task adaptation in low-data scenarios, as demonstrated through experiments on the VL-ICL Bench....
