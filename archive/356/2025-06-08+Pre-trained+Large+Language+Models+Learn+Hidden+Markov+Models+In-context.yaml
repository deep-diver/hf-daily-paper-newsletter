summary: The study finds that large language models can learn to model sequential data with latent structure using in-context learning, achieving accuracy close to the theoretical limit on synthetic data and competitive performance on real-world animal decision-making tasks. This discovery highlights the potential of in-context learning as a powerful tool for uncovering hidden patterns in complex data....
