summary: The study reveals that training small language models with limited long chain-of-thought data can lead to significant performance decline due to error accumulation. This issue, known as Long CoT Degradation, can also negatively affect downstream reinforcement learning, but it can be mitigated by large-scale supervised fine-tuning....
