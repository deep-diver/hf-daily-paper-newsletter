summary: The researchers found that current text-to-image models struggle with aligning text prompts and generated content, mainly due to token imbalance and lack of timestep awareness in attention mechanisms. They proposed TACA, a method that adjusts cross-modal attention to improve alignment, which significantly enhances performance on various models with minimal computational cost....
