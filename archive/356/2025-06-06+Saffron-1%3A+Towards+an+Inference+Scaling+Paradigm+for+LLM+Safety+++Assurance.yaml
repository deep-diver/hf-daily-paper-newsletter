summary: This study introduces SAFFRON, a new method for ensuring the safety of language models during use, as existing safety measures are vulnerable to attacks and inference scaling, which improves reasoning, has not been applied to safety. The study identifies a challenge in inference scaling for safety and proposes solutions like a multifurcation reward model and a conservative exploration constraint, which are validated through experiments....
