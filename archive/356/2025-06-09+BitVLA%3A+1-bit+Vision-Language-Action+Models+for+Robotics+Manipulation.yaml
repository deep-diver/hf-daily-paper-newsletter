summary: The authors created BitVLA, a new model for robotics manipulation that uses only 1-bit parameters, making it much smaller and more efficient for use on devices with limited memory. They also developed a training method to further reduce the memory usage of the vision encoder, and BitVLA performs as well as a larger model with 4-bit parameters on a benchmark test, using only a quarter of the memory....
