summary: SpatialLM is a large language model that can process 3D point cloud data and generate structured 3D scene understanding outputs like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes. It's trained using a large-scale synthetic dataset and outperforms previous methods in layout estimation and 3D object detection, making it useful for applications in augmented reality and robotics....
