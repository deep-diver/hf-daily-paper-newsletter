summary: This research introduces a new speech-mesh representation to improve perceptually accurate lip synchronization in 3D talking head generation, focusing on Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness. The proposed representation is used as a perceptual loss in existing models and as a metric to evaluate the alignment of generated 3D talking heads with these criteria, resulting in significant improvements in all three aspects....
