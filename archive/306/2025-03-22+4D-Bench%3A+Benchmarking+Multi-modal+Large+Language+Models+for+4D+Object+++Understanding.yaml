summary: The work presents 4D-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the understanding of multi-modal large language models for 4D objects, which are 3D objects with temporal evolution. In 4D-Bench, models are tested on tasks like 4D object Question Answering and captioning, in which the results show that models generally have weaker temporal understanding compared to their appearance understanding, with state-of-the-art GPT-4o achieving only 63% accuracy in QA compared to a human baseline of 91%....
