summary: SparseFlex is a new method for creating high-resolution 3D meshes with arbitrary topology, including open surfaces and complex interiors. It combines the accuracy of Flexicubes with a sparse voxel structure and a frustum-aware sectional voxel training strategy to reduce memory consumption and enable high-resolution training, resulting in state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and the generation of detailed 3D shapes....
