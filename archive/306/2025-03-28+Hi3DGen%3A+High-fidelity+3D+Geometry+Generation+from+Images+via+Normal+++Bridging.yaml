summary: The paper proposes Hi3DGen, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity 3D geometry from images by using normal bridging. The framework consists of an image-to-normal estimator, a normal-to-geometry learning approach, and a 3D data synthesis pipeline, outperforming existing methods in terms of fidelity....
