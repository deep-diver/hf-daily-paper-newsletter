summary: The researchers present a new method called StereoSpace that generates stereo images from a single image without using depth maps or warping. This method is evaluated using new metrics that focus on how comfortable the stereo images are to view and how consistent the geometry is, and it outperforms other methods in generating sharp and robust stereo images for various scenes....
