summary: This study presents InternGeometry, an LLM agent that can solve over 80% of IMO geometry problems with minimal training data by proposing and verifying propositions, using a dynamic memory mechanism, and employing Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning. InternGeometry also introduces novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems and outperforms existing expert models on geometry tasks....
