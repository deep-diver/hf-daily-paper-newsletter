summary: This study explores reinforcement learning for text-to-3D generation, investigating reward designs, RL algorithms, and benchmarks. The researchers introduce a new benchmark, MME-3DR, and propose Hi-GRPO, an RL paradigm for hierarchical 3D generation, resulting in the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, AR3D-R1....
