summary: Face-Adapter is a new method that uses pre-trained diffusion models to edit faces with high precision and fidelity. It separates the control of structure, ID, and attributes to achieve face reenactment and swapping tasks in one model. It performs as well as fully fine-tuned models and can be used with different StableDiffusion models....
