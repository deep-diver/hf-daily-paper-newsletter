summary: We propose a simple and effective 3D object detection model, UniDet3D, that is trained on a mixture of indoor datasets and can work in various indoor environments. UniDet3D unifies different label spaces and uses a supervised joint training scheme to learn a strong representation across multiple datasets. The network architecture is based on a vanilla transformer encoder, making it easy to run, customize, and extend for practical use. UniDet3D outperforms existing 3D object detection methods in ...
