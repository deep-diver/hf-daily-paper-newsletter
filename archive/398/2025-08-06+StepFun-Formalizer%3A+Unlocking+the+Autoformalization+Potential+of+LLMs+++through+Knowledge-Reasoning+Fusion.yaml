summary: 'The study presents ThinkingF, a training pipeline that enhances two essential abilities for autoformalization: formal language domain knowledge and natural language reasoning. By creating two datasets and using them for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, the resulting StepFun-Formalizer models demonstrate superior performance in converting natural-language mathematical statements into formal languages, setting new state-of-the-art records....'
