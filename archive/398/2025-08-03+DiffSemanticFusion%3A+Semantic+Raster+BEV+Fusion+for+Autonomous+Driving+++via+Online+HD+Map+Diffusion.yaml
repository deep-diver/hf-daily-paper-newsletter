summary: The authors present a new approach called DiffSemanticFusion that combines the strengths of raster-based and graph-based representations for online HD map generation in autonomous driving. Their method improves the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations, leading to better performance in trajectory prediction and end-to-end autonomous driving tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods....
