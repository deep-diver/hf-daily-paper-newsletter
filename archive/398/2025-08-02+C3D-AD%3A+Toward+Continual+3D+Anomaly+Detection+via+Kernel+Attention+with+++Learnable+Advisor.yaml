summary: The study presents a new framework called Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD) that can learn from various 3D object types and adapt to new ones over time. This method uses attention mechanisms and a special loss function to efficiently extract features, reconstruct data, and maintain consistency, resulting in improved performance on several public datasets....
