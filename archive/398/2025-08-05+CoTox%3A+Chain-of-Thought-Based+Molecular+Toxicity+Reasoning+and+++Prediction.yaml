summary: The authors present CoTox, a new framework that uses a large language model with step-by-step reasoning to predict multiple types of drug toxicity. By integrating chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology terms, CoTox generates interpretable predictions and outperforms traditional machine learning and deep learning models. The framework can be improved by using easier-to-understand chemical representations and incorporating biological context for more accurate predictions....
