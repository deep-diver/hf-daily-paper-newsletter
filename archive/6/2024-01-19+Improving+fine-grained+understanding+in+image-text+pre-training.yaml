summary: SPARC, a pretraining method for learning more fine-grained multimodal representations from image-text pairs, is introduced. It uses a sparse similarity metric between image patches and language tokens to group image patches for every token in the caption. Token and language-grouped vision embeddings are contrasted through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss with global image and text embeddings, enabling more detailed information to be learned in a computationally inexpensive manner. SPARC improve...
