summary: This paper argues that the popular evaluation metric for image generation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), has crucial limitations and should be reevaluated. The authors highlight FID's dependence on Inception-v3's poor representation of complex image content, its incorrect normality assumptions, and poor sample complexity. They propose a new metric, CMMD, based on richer CLIP embeddings and the Gaussian RBF kernel, which is more reliable and robust in assessing image quality. Experiments show...
