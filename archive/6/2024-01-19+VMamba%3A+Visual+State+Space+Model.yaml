summary: This paper proposes a new model called VMamba which inherits the components of ViTs that contribute to superior visual modeling performance while enhancing computational efficiency. The model achieves linear complexity without sacrificing global receptive fields and is demonstrated to have promising capabilities across various visual perception tasks, with more pronounced advantages over established benchmarks as the image resolution increases....
