summary: This paper introduces ChatQA, a family of conversational QA models that achieve GPT-4 level accuracy using a two-stage instruction tuning method. The models also use a dense retriever that reduces deployment cost while providing comparable results to state-of-the-art query rewriting models. ChatQA-70B outperforms GPT-4 in terms of average score on 10 conversational QA datasets without relying on synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models....
