summary: This paper evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and reason about multiple mental and emotional states, known as higher-order theory of mind. It finds that GPT-4 and Flan-PaLM perform at or near adult levels, with GPT-4 exceeding adults on 6th order inferences. The results suggest that model size and fine-tuning play a role in developing these abilities, and that the best-performing LLMs have a generalized capacity for higher-order theory of mind....
