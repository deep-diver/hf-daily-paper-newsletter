summary: SoundCTM is a model that allows for flexible transitioning between high-quality 1-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step generation, enabling creators to control and refine sounds with 1-step samples before refining them through multi-step generation. SoundCTM achieves both promising 1-step and multi-step real-time sound generation without using any extra off-the-shelf networks....
