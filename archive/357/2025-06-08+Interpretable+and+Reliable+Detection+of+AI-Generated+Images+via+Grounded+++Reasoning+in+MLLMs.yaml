summary: The study presents a new method for detecting AI-generated images using Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can provide explanations for their findings. To improve the model's accuracy and alignment with human reasoning, the researchers created a dataset of annotated AI-generated images and fine-tuned the MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy....
