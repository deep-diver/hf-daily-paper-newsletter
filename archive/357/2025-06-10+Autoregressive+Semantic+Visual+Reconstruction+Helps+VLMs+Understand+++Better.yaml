summary: The authors propose a new method called Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction to improve the learning of vision-language models by incorporating visual modality into a unified autoregressive framework. Experiments show that this approach enhances multimodal understanding by reconstructing semantic representations of images, leading to significant performance improvements on various benchmarks....
