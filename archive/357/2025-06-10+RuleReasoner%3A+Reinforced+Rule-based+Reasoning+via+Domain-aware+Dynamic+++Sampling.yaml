summary: The authors present a new method called RuleReasoner that enables small reasoning models to effectively learn rule-based reasoning across various tasks and domains. By updating sampling weights based on historical rewards, RuleReasoner improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art large reasoning models, while also being more computationally efficient....
