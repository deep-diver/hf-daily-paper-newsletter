summary: The authors present VersatileFFN, a new feed-forward network that allows for flexible parameter reuse in both width and depth, addressing the memory costs of large language models. This method enhances architectural capacity without increasing model size, using two adaptive pathways for efficient processing of 'easy' and 'hard' tokens, and experiments show its effectiveness across various benchmarks and model scales....
