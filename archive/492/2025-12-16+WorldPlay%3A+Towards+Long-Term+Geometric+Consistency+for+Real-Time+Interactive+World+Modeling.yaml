summary: 'The authors propose WorldPlay, a new streaming video diffusion model that allows for real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency. This is achieved through three key innovations: a Dual Action Representation for robust action control, a Reconstituted Context Memory to enforce long-term consistency, and Context Forcing, a novel distillation method for memory-aware models, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift....'
