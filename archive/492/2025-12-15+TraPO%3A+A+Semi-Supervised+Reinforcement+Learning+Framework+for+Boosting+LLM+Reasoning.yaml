summary: The study presents a new approach called TraPO that combines a small labeled dataset with unlabeled samples to train reasoning models more efficiently and effectively than previous unsupervised methods. This method outperforms fully supervised models and existing unsupervised ones, even with significantly less labeled data, by ensuring only verified reasoning patterns are incorporated into the training process....
