summary: This study presents RoboTracer, a 3D-aware Vision-Language Model designed to enhance spatial reasoning in robots, enabling them to understand, measure, and refer to spatial concepts more accurately. The model, trained using a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, outperforms existing methods in spatial tracing tasks, making it suitable for complex, long-term robotic tasks in various environments....
