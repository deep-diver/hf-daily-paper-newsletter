summary: The authors present a new method called Differentiable Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (DERL) that helps in designing better reward systems for training AI agents in complex tasks. DERL improves upon previous methods by being differentiable, which allows it to learn more effectively and adapt to new situations, ultimately leading to better performance in various tasks compared to other methods....
