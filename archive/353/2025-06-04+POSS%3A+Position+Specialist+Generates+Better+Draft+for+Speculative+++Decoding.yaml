summary: This research presents Position Specialists (PosS) to enhance speculative decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). PosS improves token accuracy at later positions by using position-specialized draft layers, reducing error accumulation and boosting acceptance rates. Experiments show that PosS outperforms baselines in average acceptance length and speed-up ratio on various datasets....
