summary: This study explores the balance between stability and plasticity in neural networks from an architectural perspective. The researchers find that deeper networks are more adaptable, while wider networks are more stable, and propose a new framework called Dual-Arch to improve existing continual learning methods by combining the strengths of two specialized networks....
