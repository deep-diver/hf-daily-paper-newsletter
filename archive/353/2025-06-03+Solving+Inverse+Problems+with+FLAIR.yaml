summary: This study presents FLAIR, a new method that uses flow-based generative models to improve the quality of solutions for inverse imaging problems. By introducing a variational objective for flow matching and combining it with deterministic trajectory adjustments, FLAIR can recover rare, atypical data modes and consistently outperforms existing diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and sample diversity....
