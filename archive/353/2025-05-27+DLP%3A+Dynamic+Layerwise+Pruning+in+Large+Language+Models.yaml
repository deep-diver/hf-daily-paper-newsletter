summary: The authors present a new method called Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP) that determines the importance of each layer in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating model weights with input activation information, thereby improving performance at high sparsity levels. DLP reduces perplexity and improves accuracy compared to existing methods and can be combined with other LLM compression techniques....
