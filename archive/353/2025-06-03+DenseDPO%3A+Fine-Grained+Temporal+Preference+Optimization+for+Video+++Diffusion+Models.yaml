summary: The study presents DenseDPO, a method that improves upon the Direct Preference Optimization technique used for text-to-video diffusion models. DenseDPO addresses limitations in fine-grained comparisons and motion bias by creating aligned video pairs and labeling preferences on short segments, resulting in better motion generation with fewer labels. Additionally, DenseDPO can use Vision Language Models for automatic preference annotation, achieving performance close to human labels....
