summary: The study addresses limitations of reinforcement learning with numerical feedback in large language models by proposing Critique-GRPO, an online framework that uses both natural language and numerical feedback for policy optimization. Experiments show that Critique-GRPO significantly outperforms other methods in various reasoning tasks, improving average scores by around 5%....
