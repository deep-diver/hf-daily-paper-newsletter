summary: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) use partial products during arithmetic learning and how they approach arithmetic symbolically. The results show that LLMs treat different arithmetic operations similarly when subgroup complexity is fixed, and they learn the easiest patterns first and last, while progressively learning the more difficult patterns in the middle. This suggests that LLMs learn arithmetic symbolically by selecting subgroups following an easy-to-hard paradig...
