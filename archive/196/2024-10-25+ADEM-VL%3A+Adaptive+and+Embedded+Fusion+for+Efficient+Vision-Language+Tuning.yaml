summary: The paper introduces ADEM-VL, a method that tunes vision-language models by adopting a parameter-free cross-attention mechanism for fusion. This reduces the number of trainable parameters and speeds up training and inference. It also proposes an adaptive fusion scheme that discards less relevant visual information for each text token, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods on various tasks....
