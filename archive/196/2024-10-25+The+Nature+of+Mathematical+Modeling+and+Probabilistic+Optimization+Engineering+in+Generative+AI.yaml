summary: This paper provides an in-depth analysis of mathematical problem formulations and probabilistic optimization techniques for key components in Transformer models used in generative AI. It introduces potential enhancements for current state-of-the-art methods and presents optimal solutions for sub-word encoding, cross entropy optimization for word2vec models, and factored combinations of rotary positional encoding and attention with linear biases. The paper also proposes a probabilistic FlashAtten...
