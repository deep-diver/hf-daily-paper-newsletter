summary: We have created a new dataset called CCI3.0-HQ, which is a subset of the Chinese Corpora Internet 3.0 (CCI3.0) dataset. This new dataset is of high quality and was created using a special two-step filtering process. We tested this new dataset by training a 0.5 billion parameter model on it and found that it performed better than other datasets on 10 different tests. We hope that by making this dataset available to the public, it will help more people create better language models....
