summary: We present a set of methods to improve reward modeling for Large Language Models (LLMs) by focusing on data-centric techniques. Our methods involve effective data selection and filtering strategies to create a high-quality dataset called Skywork-Reward, which is significantly smaller than existing datasets. We developed the Skywork-Reward model series, which currently ranks top on the RewardBench leaderboard. Our techniques and datasets have directly enhanced the performance of many top-ranked m...
