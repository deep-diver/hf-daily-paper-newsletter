summary: The study presents a new method called PM-Loss to enhance the quality of feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting using depth maps. PM-Loss, based on a pointmap from a pre-trained transformer, improves geometric smoothness and reduces fragmentation in point clouds, leading to better rendering results across different architectures and scenes....
