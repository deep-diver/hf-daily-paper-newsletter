summary: The study derives scaling laws for comparing language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT, across various scales and tasks, finding MaMMUT to be more scalable and sample-efficient. The research provides a systematic method for comparing and improving open foundation models and datasets, releasing pre-trained models and code for reproducibility....
