summary: The authors present RoboRefer, a 3D-aware vision language model that improves spatial understanding and reasoning for robotic interaction with complex 3D scenes. They introduce a large-scale dataset and a challenging benchmark, demonstrating that RoboRefer outperforms existing models in spatial referring tasks, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy....
