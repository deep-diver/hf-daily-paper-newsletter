summary: This paper presents a new method for 3D reconstruction and relighting of objects made from scattering materials. The method decomposes the scene into an explicit surface and an implicit volumetric representation of the scattering component. It optimizes all parameters jointly via ray-traced differentiable rendering, enabling material editing, relighting, and novel view synthesis at interactive rates. The method is applied to synthetic data and a newly acquired multi-view multi-light dataset, ach...
