summary: The researchers developed MotionStream, a method that allows for real-time video generation with motion controls, overcoming the limitations of existing methods that have long latency and non-causal processing. By using a text-to-video model with motion control and a causal student, MotionStream achieves sub-second latency and up to 29 frames per second on a single GPU, enabling users to interactively control video generation in real-time....
