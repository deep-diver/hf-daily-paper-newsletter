summary: This study presents a new approach to unify vision, language, and action models by integrating multiple modalities into a single denoising process, allowing for synergy between understanding, generating, and acting. The proposed method, Unified Diffusion VLA, achieves superior performance on various benchmarks and is faster than previous methods, as demonstrated through extensive analysis and real-world applications....
