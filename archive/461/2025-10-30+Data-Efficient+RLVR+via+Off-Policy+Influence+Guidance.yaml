summary: This study presents a new method for selecting data in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards, which uses influence functions to estimate the importance of each data point. The proposed approach, called CROPI, uses off-policy influence estimation and sparse random projection to efficiently select the most influential data for training large language models, resulting in significant acceleration of the training process....
