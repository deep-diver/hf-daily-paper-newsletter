summary: The authors propose a new framework for universal video retrieval by introducing the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark, a suite of 16 datasets to evaluate and diagnose capability gaps. They then use this benchmark to create a large dataset of high-quality video pairs and train a General Video Embedder model, which outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization....
