summary: The authors propose a new method called VolSplat to improve 3D Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis. VolSplat addresses limitations of existing pixel-aligned methods by using voxel-aligned Gaussians, resulting in more accurate and consistent 3D reconstructions, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks....
