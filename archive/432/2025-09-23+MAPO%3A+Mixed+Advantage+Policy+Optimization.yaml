summary: This study presents MAPO, a new strategy for reinforcement learning in foundation models that addresses issues with advantage function allocation. MAPO improves the advantage function by considering the certainty of trajectories and dynamically adjusting the function for different samples, which enhances the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks compared to existing methods....
