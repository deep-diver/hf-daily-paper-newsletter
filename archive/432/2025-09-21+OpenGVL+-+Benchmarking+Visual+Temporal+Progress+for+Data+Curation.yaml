summary: The study presents OpenGVL, a benchmark for estimating task progress in various manipulation tasks using robotics and human embodiments. They find that open-source models perform significantly worse than closed-source ones in predicting task progress, and demonstrate how OpenGVL can be used for automated data curation and filtering....
