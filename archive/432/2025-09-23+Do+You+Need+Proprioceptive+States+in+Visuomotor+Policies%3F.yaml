summary: This study shows that removing proprioceptive state input from robot manipulation policies and relying only on visual observations improves spatial generalization, data efficiency, and cross-embodiment adaptation. The new State-free Policy, using dual wide-angle wrist cameras, significantly enhances success rates in various real-world tasks, such as pick-and-place and shirt-folding, compared to traditional state-based policies....
