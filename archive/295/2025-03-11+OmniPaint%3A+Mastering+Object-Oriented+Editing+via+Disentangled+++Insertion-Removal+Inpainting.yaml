summary: This study presents OmniPaint, a unified framework for object removal and insertion, addressing challenges in diffusion-based generative models for realistic image editing. OmniPaint leverages a pre-trained diffusion prior and a progressive training pipeline, achieving precise editing while preserving scene geometry and intrinsic properties. The new CFD metric is introduced for evaluating context consistency and object hallucination....
