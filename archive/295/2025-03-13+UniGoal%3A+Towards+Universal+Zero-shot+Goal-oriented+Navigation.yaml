summary: A universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation framework is presented by using a uniform graph representation to connect different types of goals and an online maintained scene graph. This framework allows for explicit graph-based reasoning using large language models, enabling efficient matching, inferring goal locations, and correcting scene graphs, resulting in state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple navigation tasks....
