summary: ARPG is a visual autoregressive model that allows for randomized parallel image generation, overcoming the limitations of conventional models that generate tokens sequentially. It uses a guided decoding framework to separate positional guidance from content representation and enables fully random-order training and generation, leading to improved zero-shot generalization and parallel inference....
