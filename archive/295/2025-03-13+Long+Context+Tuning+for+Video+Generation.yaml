summary: The proposed Long Context Tuning (LCT) training paradigm enhances existing single-shot video diffusion models to generate multi-shot videos with visual and dynamic consistency. LCT achieves this by expanding full attention mechanisms across all shots within a scene, incorporating 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy, enabling both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters....
