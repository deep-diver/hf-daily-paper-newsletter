summary: CoSTA* is a three-stage approach that combines the strengths of LLMs and graph search to find cost-efficient tool paths for multi-turn image editing. It leverages LLMs to create a subtask tree, prunes a graph of AI tools for the given task, and conducts A* search on the small subgraph to find a tool path, while balancing the total cost and quality by combining both metrics of each tool on every subtask and automatically switching between modalities across subtasks....
