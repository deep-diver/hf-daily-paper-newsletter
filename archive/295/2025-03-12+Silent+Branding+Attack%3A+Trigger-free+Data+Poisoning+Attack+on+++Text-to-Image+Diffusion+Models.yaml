summary: The paper proposes a novel data poisoning method, Silent Branding Attack, that tricks text-to-image diffusion models into generating images with specific brand logos or symbols, without any text triggers. This technique exploits the fact that models learn to reproduce repeated visual patterns, and injects logos into images so they blend naturally and remain undetected, achieving high success rates in experiments on large-scale datasets....
