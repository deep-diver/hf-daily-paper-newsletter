summary: The study examines various architectural choices and training protocols for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) in text-to-image generation, comparing their performance with a standard DiT variant. The findings reveal that the standard DiT has superior parameter-efficiency, leading to the creation of DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite, which outperform most existing models while maintaining compact sizes....
