summary: SANA-Sprint is a high-efficiency text-to-image generation model that uses a pre-trained foundation model and hybrid distillation to reduce inference steps from 20 to 1-4, with a unified step-adaptive model for high-quality generation in just 1-4 steps. It also integrates ControlNet for real-time interactive image generation and outperforms FLUX-schnell in terms of speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving a new Pareto frontier....
