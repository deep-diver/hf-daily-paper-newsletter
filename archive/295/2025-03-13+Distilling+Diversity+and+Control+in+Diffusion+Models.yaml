summary: The paper discovers that despite reduced diversity, distilled diffusion models retain fundamental concept representations of base models. They introduce 'diversity distillation,' which restores and even surpasses the diversity capabilities of base models while maintaining computational efficiency, all without requiring additional training or model modifications....
