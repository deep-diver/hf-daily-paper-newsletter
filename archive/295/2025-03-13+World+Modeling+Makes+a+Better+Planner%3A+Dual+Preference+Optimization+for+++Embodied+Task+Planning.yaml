summary: The paper introduces a new learning framework, Dual Preference Optimization, that improves embodied task planning by jointly optimizing state prediction and action selection through preference learning, enhancing the understanding of environment dynamics for better planning. It also proposes a tree search mechanism for automatic trajectory and preference data collection, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and GPT-4o on VoTa-Bench for various large vision-language models....
