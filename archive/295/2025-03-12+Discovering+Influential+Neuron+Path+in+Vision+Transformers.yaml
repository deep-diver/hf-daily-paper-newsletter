summary: The paper explores the significance of influential neuron paths in vision Transformers by proposing a joint influence measure and a layer-progressive neuron locating approach to find the most influential path from input to output. Experiments show that the found neuron paths have preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, offering insights for real-world applications such as model pruning....
