summary: The abstract introduces a new method called Multistep Latent Consistency Models (MLCMs) for generating high-quality images with only a few steps. This method extends a recent strategy called multistep consistency distillation (MCD) to large latent diffusion models (LDMs) and uses the states from the sampling trajectories of a teacher model as training data. MLCM can generate high-quality, visually appealing images with only 2-8 steps and outperforms other methods such as LCM, SDXL-Lightning, and...
