summary: Tx-LLM is a versatile large language model trained on a diverse range of datasets to predict various properties related to drug discovery. It achieves competitive performance on 43 out of 66 tasks and exceeds state-of-the-art on 22 tasks, particularly excelling in tasks that combine molecular representations with text. The model's performance is influenced by factors such as model size, domain fine-tuning, and prompting strategies, and it demonstrates positive transfer between tasks with differe...
