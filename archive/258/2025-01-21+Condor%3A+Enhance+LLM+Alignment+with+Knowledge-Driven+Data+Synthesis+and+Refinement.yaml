summary: The paper presents Condor, a framework for generating high-quality synthetic data for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement. Experiments show that a base model fine-tuned on 20K Condor-generated samples outperforms other models and that the refinement stage enables self-improvement for LLMs of various scales, suggesting potential for future research....
