summary: This paper proposes a new method called Agent-R for training language models to correct their own mistakes in real-time. It uses a process called Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to create training data that helps the model recover from errors. The model also has a mechanism to identify its mistakes and fix them quickly. Experiments show that this method helps the model perform better in interactive environments, correcting mistakes and avoiding loops. It outperforms other methods by 5.59%....
