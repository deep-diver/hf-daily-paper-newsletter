summary: This paper introduces Gecko, a versatile and compact text embedding model that achieves strong retrieval performance by distilling knowledge from large language models. Gecko's two-step distillation process involves generating diverse synthetic paired data and refining data quality through relabeling, resulting in improved retrieval performance compared to existing models with larger sizes and higher dimensional embeddings....
