summary: This paper introduces a new method to create a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset with detailed rationales, which improves the reasoning capabilities of open-source multimodal large language models. The dataset is created using only open models and contains 12M instruction-response pairs. Experiments show that training MLLMs on this dataset improves performance on reasoning-intensive tasks and even non-reasoning-based benchmarks....
