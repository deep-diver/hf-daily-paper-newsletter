summary: Momentum-GS is a new method that improves the accuracy of large-scale scene reconstruction by using a moving average of a teacher Gaussian decoder to provide guidance to each block during training. It also dynamically adjusts the weight of each block based on its accuracy. This method outperforms existing techniques by 12.8% in LPIPS and requires fewer divided blocks....
