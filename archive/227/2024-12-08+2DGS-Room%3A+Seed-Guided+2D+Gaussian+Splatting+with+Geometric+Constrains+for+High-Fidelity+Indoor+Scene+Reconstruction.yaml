summary: The paper proposes a new method called 2DGS-Room that uses 2D Gaussian Splatting to create detailed indoor scenes. It uses seed points to control the distribution of the Gaussians and adds depth and normal information to make the scenes more accurate. The method also uses multi-view consistency to reduce artifacts and improve the overall quality of the reconstructions. Experiments show that this method performs better than existing ones for indoor scene reconstruction....
