summary: This paper proposes Moto, a method to use video data to improve robot learning by converting video content into latent Motion Token sequences and pre-training a model called Moto-GPT. The paper also introduces a co-fine-tuning strategy to transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, and experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT is effective in improving robot manipulation tasks....
