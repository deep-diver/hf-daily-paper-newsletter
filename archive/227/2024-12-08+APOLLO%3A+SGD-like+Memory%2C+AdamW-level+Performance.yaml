summary: APOLLO is a new optimizer that achieves AdamW-level performance while using less memory, allowing for faster training and larger batch sizes on less powerful GPUs. It does this by approximating learning rate scaling using an auxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on random projection, which makes it highly tolerant to further memory reductions. The APOLLO series performs on-par with or better than AdamW, and provides significant system-level benefits, including enhanced throughput, improved mo...
