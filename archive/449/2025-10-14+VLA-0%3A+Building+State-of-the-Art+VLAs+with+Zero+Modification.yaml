summary: This research explores a straightforward approach to building Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) by representing actions as text, which surprisingly outperforms more complex models like pi_0.5-KI, OpenVLA-OFT, and SmolVLA on the LIBERO benchmark. Even without extensive robotics-specific training, this simple VLA design exceeds the performance of methods trained on large-scale robotic data and real-world pre-trained models, highlighting the effectiveness of this uncomplicated strategy....
