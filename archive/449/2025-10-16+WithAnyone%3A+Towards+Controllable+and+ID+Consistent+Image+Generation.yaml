summary: The authors present a new method for generating images that are consistent with a given identity, while also being diverse in terms of pose, expression, and lighting. They achieve this by creating a large dataset of paired images, developing a benchmark to measure the quality of the generated images, and proposing a new training approach that balances identity fidelity with diversity. The resulting model, called WithAnyone, significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts and improves controllability ...
