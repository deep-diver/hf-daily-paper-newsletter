summary: The study presents a new reinforcement learning framework called Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO) that helps multi-turn LLM agents learn more effectively by providing dense and intrinsic supervision. IGPO improves upon existing methods by offering turn-level rewards based on the model's belief updates, which leads to better performance and sample efficiency in various multi-turn scenarios....
