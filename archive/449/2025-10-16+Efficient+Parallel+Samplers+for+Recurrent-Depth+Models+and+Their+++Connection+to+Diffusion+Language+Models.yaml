summary: The study looks at the connection between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models, and creates a new diffusion forcing sampler to speed up the generation process. This sampler, which can be applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any adjustments, results in a significant 5x speedup, offering an efficient way to parallelize computation in recurrent-depth models....
