summary: The study presents TokDrift, a framework that highlights the issue of subword tokenization in large language models for code, which can lead to different tokenization for similar code snippets. This problem, originating in early embeddings, affects even large models and suggests the need for grammar-aware tokenization for better code understanding and generation....
