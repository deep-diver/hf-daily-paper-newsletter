summary: The study presents a new framework called MathCanvas that enhances the ability of multimodal models to use visual aids for mathematical reasoning, specifically in geometry. By pre-training models on a large dataset of diagrams and their corresponding captions, and fine-tuning them on a dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, the framework enables models to generate high-quality diagrams and use them strategically for complex problem-solving. The resulting model, BAGEL-Canvas, sign...
