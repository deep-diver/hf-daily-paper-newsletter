summary: The study presents SCas4D, a new framework that uses structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting to efficiently model dynamic scenes with accurate deformations. By refining deformations progressively, SCas4D achieves fast convergence and performs well in various tasks like novel view synthesis and dense point tracking, while requiring significantly fewer training iterations compared to existing methods....
