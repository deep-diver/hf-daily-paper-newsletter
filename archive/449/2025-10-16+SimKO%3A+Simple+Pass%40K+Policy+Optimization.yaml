summary: This study identifies a bias in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods towards exploitation over exploration, resulting in better single-choice accuracy but poorer multi-choice performance. The researchers propose SimKO, an asymmetrical optimization method that boosts top-K probabilities for correct responses and penalizes top-1 probabilities for incorrect ones, effectively mitigating the over-concentration issue and improving exploration in various math and logical reason...
