summary: This study explores how to improve the performance of Transformer networks when faced with unfamiliar data, using a complex math task as a test case. The researchers propose and test four new architectural mechanisms designed to enhance the network's ability to generalize, ultimately creating a more robust and scalable system for handling unknown data....
