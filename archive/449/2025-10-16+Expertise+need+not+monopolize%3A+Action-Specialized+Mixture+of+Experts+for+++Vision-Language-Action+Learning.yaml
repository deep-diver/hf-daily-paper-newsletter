summary: The authors present a new architecture called AdaMoE, which improves the efficiency and performance of vision-language-action models used in robotic manipulation tasks. AdaMoE addresses the challenges of scaling up these models by leveraging pretrained weights, balancing model capacity with computational efficiency, and enabling collaborative expert utilization, resulting in superior performance and significant improvements in key benchmarks and real-world experiments....
