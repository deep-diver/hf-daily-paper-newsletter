summary: The paper proposes PipeOffload, a method to enhance the scalability of pipeline parallelism for training large language models by utilizing memory offload. Through empirical studies, it's found that a significant portion of activation memory can be offloaded with negligible overhead, and a novel selective offload strategy is introduced for cases where full offload isn't possible. Experiments show that PipeOffload can reduce per-device activation memory and offer up to a 19% acceleration with low...
