summary: 'This work introduces a new approach to improving uniformity in the latent space for imbalanced regression by using two geometric losses: enveloping and homogeneity. These losses ensure uniform feature distribution and smoothness in the latent space, which is essential for regression tasks, and are integrated into a Surrogate-driven Representation Learning framework....'
