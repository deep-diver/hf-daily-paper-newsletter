summary: The paper presents LADDER, a novel framework that allows language models to autonomously enhance their problem-solving skills through self-guided learning by creating and solving simpler versions of complex problems. The framework is demonstrated to improve Llama 3.2 3B's accuracy from 1% to 82% on undergraduate-level math problems and Qwen2.5 7B Deepseek-R1 Distilled's performance on the MIT Integration Bee qualifying examination, surpassing OpenAI o1's achievement....
