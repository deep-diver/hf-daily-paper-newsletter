summary: 'The authors address the challenges of compressing large-scale Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs) using Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which faces issues like heavy-tailed activation distributions and unstable calibration sample selection. They introduce QuantVGGT, a quantization framework with two main contributions: Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel variance, and Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling to ensure stable quantiz...'
