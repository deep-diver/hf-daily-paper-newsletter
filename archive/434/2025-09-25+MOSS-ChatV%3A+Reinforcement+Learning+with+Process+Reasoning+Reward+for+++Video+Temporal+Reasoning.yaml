summary: The authors present a new framework called MOSS-ChatV that uses reinforcement learning with a dynamic reward system to improve the understanding of temporal dynamics in videos by multimodal large language models. This framework enhances the interpretability and robustness of these models by aligning their reasoning process with the video content, and it has shown significant improvements in various benchmarks and different architectures....
