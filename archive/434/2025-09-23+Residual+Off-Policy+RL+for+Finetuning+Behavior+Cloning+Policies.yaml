summary: The authors propose a method that combines behavior cloning and reinforcement learning to improve visuomotor control policies for high-degree-of-freedom systems. By using behavior cloning policies as a base and adding lightweight corrections through off-policy RL, the approach requires less data and can work with sparse rewards, leading to state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, including the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands....
