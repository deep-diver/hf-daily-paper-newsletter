summary: 'This paper proposes Meta-Chunking, a method for text segmentation that improves the performance of knowledge-intensive tasks. It uses large language models to segment text into meaningful units called Meta-Chunks, which are collections of sentences with deep logical connections. The paper also introduces two strategies for implementing Meta-Chunking: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. Experiments show that Meta-Chunking can improve the performance of single-hop and multi-hop quest...'
