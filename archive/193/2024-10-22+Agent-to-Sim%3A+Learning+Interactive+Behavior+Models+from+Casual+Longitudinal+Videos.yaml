summary: The paper presents Agent-to-Sim (ATS), a framework for learning interactive behavior models of 3D agents from casual longitudinal video collections. ATS learns natural behaviors of animal and human agents non-invasively through video observations recorded over a long time-span in a single environment. A coarse-to-fine registration method is developed to track the agent and the camera over time through a canonical 3D space, resulting in a complete and persistent spacetime 4D representation. A gen...
