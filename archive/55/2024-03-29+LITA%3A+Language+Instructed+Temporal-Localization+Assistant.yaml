summary: This paper proposes a new model, LITA, that improves the temporal localization capabilities of existing multimodal language models by introducing new time tokens, using SlowFast tokens in the architecture, and emphasizing temporal localization data. LITA demonstrates strong performance on a new task, Reasoning Temporal Localization, and improves video-based text generation....
