summary: We propose a novel method for video-language understanding that significantly reduces computational overhead by directly processing video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders. Our Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) uses only 45M parameters for visual processing, which is a 6.5 times reduction compared to traditional approaches. The STAB architecture combines Local Spatio-Temporal Encoding for fine-grained feature extraction, efficient spatial downsampling through learned attention, ...
