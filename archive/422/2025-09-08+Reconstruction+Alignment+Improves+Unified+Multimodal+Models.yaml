summary: The study presents a new method called Reconstruction Alignment that enhances unified multimodal models by using visual understanding encoder embeddings as 'text prompts' for image reconstruction. This simple and resource-efficient technique improves image generation and editing fidelity across various model architectures, outperforming larger open-source models with only 27 GPU-hours of training....
