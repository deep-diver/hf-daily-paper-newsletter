summary: The authors present a new framework called UMO that improves the consistency and scalability of preserving multiple identities in image customization, addressing a significant challenge in current methods. UMO uses a 'multi-to-multi matching' approach, reformulating identity generation as an optimization problem and reducing identity confusion through reinforcement learning on diffusion models, outperforming existing open-source methods....
