summary: The study finds that reinforcement learning improves complex reasoning in language models by developing a hierarchy of skills, first focusing on low-level procedures and then on high-level strategies. The researchers propose a new algorithm, HICA, which focuses on high-impact planning tokens, outperforming existing algorithms and providing a better measure of strategic exploration....
