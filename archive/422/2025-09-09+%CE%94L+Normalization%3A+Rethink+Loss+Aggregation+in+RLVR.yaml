summary: The study presents Delta L Normalization, a new method to handle varying response lengths in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which helps stabilize the training process and improve performance of large language models. The method reduces gradient variance and provides unbiased estimates of the true policy loss, outperforming previous techniques in various experiments....
