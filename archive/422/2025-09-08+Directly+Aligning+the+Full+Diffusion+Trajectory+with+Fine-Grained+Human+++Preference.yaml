summary: The study presents Direct-Align, a method that predefines a noise prior to recover original images from any time steps via interpolation, avoiding over-optimization in late timesteps. Additionally, Semantic Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO) is introduced, enabling online adjustment of rewards in response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, which reduces the need for offline reward fine-tuning....
