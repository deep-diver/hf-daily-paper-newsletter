summary: NeRF-MAE, a self-supervised 3D representation learning method for Neural Radiance Fields, uses masked autoencoders and 3D Vision Transformers to scale pretraining and improve performance on 3D tasks. It outperforms self-supervised 3D pretraining and NeRF scene understanding baselines by over 20% AP50 and 8% AP25 for 3D object detection....
