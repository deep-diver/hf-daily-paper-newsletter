summary: The proposed LiteASR method uses low-rank compression to reduce the computational intensity of ASR encoders, achieving significant inference cost savings while maintaining transcription accuracy by leveraging strong low-rank properties in intermediate activations and optimizing self-attention for reduced dimensions, resulting in a new Pareto-optimal frontier of efficiency and performance....
