summary: This paper presents Imp, a family of highly capable large multimodal models for mobile devices. The authors conducted a systematic study to investigate the key design choices that influence model capability, resulting in a model that outperforms existing lightweight models and even surpasses state-of-the-art models at a larger scale. The Imp model can be deployed on a mobile chip with a high inference speed of about 13 tokens/s using low-bit quantization and resolution reduction techniques....
