summary: The paper introduces a new method called Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) to improve the accuracy of generating 3D models from text. TSM reduces the error in the inversion process by using two paths instead of one. The paper also proposes a new way to use Stable Diffusion XL for guidance and a method to fix issues with the 3D Gaussian splatting process. Experiments show that the new method produces better results than existing methods....
