summary: This paper proposes a new optical flow architecture, called NeuFlow, that
  achieves high accuracy and efficiency for real-time applications on edge devices
  like robots, achieving a notable speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods and
  enabling complex computer vision tasks like SLAM on small robots like drones....
