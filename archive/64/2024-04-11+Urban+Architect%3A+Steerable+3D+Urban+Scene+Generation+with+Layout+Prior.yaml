summary: This paper introduces a new method for generating 3D urban scenes by using a compositional 3D layout representation to complement textual descriptions and enable steerable generation. The authors propose modifications to address optimization issues and handle the unbounded nature of urban scenes. The framework is capable of scaling text-to-3D generation to large-scale urban scenes, and demonstrations show the powers of steerable urban scene generation....
