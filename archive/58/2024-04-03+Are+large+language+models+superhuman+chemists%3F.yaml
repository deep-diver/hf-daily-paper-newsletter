summary: This paper introduces an automated framework called ChemBench to evaluate the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) and finds that the best LLMs outperform human chemists on average, but struggle with some tasks and provide misleading predictions. This highlights the need for further research to enhance the safety and utility of LLMs in the chemical sciences and adaptations to chemistry curricula....
