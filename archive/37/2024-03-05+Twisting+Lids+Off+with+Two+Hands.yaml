summary: This paper shows how to use deep reinforcement learning to train a policy
  for twisting lids off of bottle-like objects with two hands. The policy is trained
  in simulation and then transferred to the real world, showing generalization capabilities
  across a diverse set of unseen objects and demonstrating dynamic and dexterous behaviors....
