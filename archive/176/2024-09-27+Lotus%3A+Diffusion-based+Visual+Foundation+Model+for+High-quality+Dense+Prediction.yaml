summary: This paper proposes Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model for high-quality dense prediction tasks. It improves performance by learning to directly predict annotations instead of noise, and simplifying the diffusion process into a single-step procedure. It also introduces a detail preserver strategy for more accurate predictions. Lotus achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation tasks, while being hundreds of times faster than existing methods without...
