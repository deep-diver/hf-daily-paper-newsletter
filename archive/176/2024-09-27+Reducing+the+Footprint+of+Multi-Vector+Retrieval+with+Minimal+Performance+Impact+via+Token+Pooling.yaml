summary: We propose a clustering-based token pooling approach that reduces the number of vectors needed for multi-vector retrieval by ColBERT, resulting in a 50% reduction in space and memory footprint with minimal impact on retrieval performance. This method can be easily integrated into existing ColBERT-like models during indexation....
