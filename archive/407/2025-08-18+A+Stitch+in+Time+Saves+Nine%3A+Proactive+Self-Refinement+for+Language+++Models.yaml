summary: The authors propose a new method called ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR) that allows language models to improve their outputs during the generation process, unlike existing methods that regenerate entire responses. PASR makes decisions on refinement based on the model's internal state and evolving context, and it significantly enhances problem-solving performance while reducing token consumption and improving accuracy in various tasks....
