summary: This study proposes a new method called 'pointing' to improve generalization in embodied AI by bridging the gap between high-level vision-language comprehension and low-level actions. The proposed model, Embodied-R1, outperforms existing models in various benchmarks and demonstrates robust zero-shot generalization in real-world tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning....
