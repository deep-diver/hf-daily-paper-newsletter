summary: This study presents a self-attentive prototypical network to enhance the detection of synthesized speech in various conditions, such as unseen synthesis methods or languages, by rapidly adapting to new data with few samples. The proposed method significantly outperforms traditional zero-shot detectors in challenging conditions, reducing error rates by up to 32% and 20% in Japanese deepfakes and ASVspoof 2021 Deepfake datasets, respectively....
