summary: The study presents a new approach called FlowRL for reinforcement learning in large language models, which focuses on matching the full reward distribution through flow balancing rather than just maximizing rewards. This method promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories, outperforming existing methods on math and code reasoning tasks by a significant margin....
