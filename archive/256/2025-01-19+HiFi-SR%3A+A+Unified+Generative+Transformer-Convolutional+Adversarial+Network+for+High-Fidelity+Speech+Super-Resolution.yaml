summary: This paper introduces HiFi-SR, a unified network for high-quality speech super-resolution. It uses a transformer-convolutional generator and a time-frequency discriminator to improve speech quality, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. It can upscale speech signals from 4 kHz to 32 kHz to a 48 kHz sampling rate, and it performs better than existing methods in both objective and subjective tests....
