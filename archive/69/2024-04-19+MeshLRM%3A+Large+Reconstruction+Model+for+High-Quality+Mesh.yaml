summary: This paper introduces MeshLRM, a new approach that can quickly create high-quality 3D models from only four images. It improves on previous methods by simplifying the training process and achieves state-of-the-art results for mesh reconstruction, with potential applications in text-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation....
