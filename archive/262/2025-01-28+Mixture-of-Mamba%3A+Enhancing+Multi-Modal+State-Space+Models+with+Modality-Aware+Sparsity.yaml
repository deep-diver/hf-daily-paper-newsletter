summary: The paper presents Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel architecture that enhances multi-modal state-space models with modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. The proposed model achieves superior performance in multi-modal pretraining settings while reducing computational costs....
