summary: The paper introduces Guidance-Free Training (GFT), a method to train visual models without guided sampling, which matches the performance of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) while halving the computational cost. GFT is simple to implement and achieves comparable or even better results across various visual models compared to CFG baselines....
