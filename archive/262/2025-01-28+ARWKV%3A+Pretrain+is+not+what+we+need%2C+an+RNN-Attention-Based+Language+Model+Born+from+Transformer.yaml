summary: The abstract presents a new RNN-Attention-Based Language Model called ARWKV, which is an evolution of the Qwen 2.5 model, focusing on improving RNN expressiveness using pure native RWKV-7 attention. The model has been distilled from Qwen 2.5 to reduce processing time and enable knowledge transfer from larger LLMs to smaller ones, ultimately aiming to build more powerful foundation models....
