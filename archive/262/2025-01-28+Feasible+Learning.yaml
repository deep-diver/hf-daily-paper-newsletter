summary: Feasible Learning is presented as a learning paradigm that requires models to perform well on individual training samples rather than just the average, unlike Empirical Risk Minimization. A primal-dual approach with adaptive sample weighting is explored, with a relaxation using slack variables to tackle practical threshold-setting challenges. The approach shows better tail performance in image classification, age regression, and LLM preference optimization tasks....
