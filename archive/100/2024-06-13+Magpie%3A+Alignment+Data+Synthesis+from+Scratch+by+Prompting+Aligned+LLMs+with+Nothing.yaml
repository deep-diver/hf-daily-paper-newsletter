summary: This paper introduces Magpie, a method for generating high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM. The authors present a comprehensive analysis and show that models fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through supervised fine-tuning and subsequent feedback learning. Magpie can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both supervi...
