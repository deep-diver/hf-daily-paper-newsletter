summary: NaRCan is a video editing framework that uses a hybrid deformation field and diffusion prior to generate high-quality natural images from input videos. It models global motion with homography and local residual deformations with MLPs, and accelerates training by 14 times with LoRA fine-tuning and diffusion prior update scheduling. It outperforms existing methods in video editing tasks and produces coherent, high-quality edited video sequences....
