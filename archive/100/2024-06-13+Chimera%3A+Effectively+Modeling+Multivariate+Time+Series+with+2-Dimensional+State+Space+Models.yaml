summary: The abstract discusses the limitations of traditional State Space Models (SSMs) in modeling multivariate time series and proposes Chimera as a new approach to overcome these limitations. Chimera uses two input-dependent 2-D SSM heads with different discretization processes to learn long-term progression and seasonal patterns, and introduces a fast training method using a new 2-dimensional parallel selective scan. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of Chimera on var...
