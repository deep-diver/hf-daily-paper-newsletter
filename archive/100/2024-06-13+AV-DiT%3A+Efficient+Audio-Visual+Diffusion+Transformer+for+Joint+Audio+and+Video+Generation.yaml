summary: AV-DiT is a novel and efficient audio-visual diffusion transformer that generates high-quality videos with both visual and audio tracks. It uses a shared DiT backbone pre-trained on image-only data and lightweight, newly inserted adapters to minimize model complexity and computational costs. AV-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint audio-visual generation with significantly fewer tunable parameters....
