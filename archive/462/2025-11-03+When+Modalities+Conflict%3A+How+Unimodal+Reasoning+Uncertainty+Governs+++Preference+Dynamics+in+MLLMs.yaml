summary: 'This study presents a framework that explains how large language models handle contradictory information from different sources by separating it into two parts: the confidence gap between predictions from each source and the model''s inherent bias when there''s no clear confidence. They found that the model''s preference for one source over another decreases as the uncertainty in its predictions increases, and this framework helps us better understand how these models make decisions when faced with...'
