summary: The authors present a new method called Brain-IT for reconstructing images from fMRI brain recordings. This approach uses a Brain Interaction Transformer to effectively interact between brain-voxel clusters and predict image features, achieving more accurate reconstructions with less data compared to current state-of-the-art methods....
