summary: The paper presents a method for precise control of object orientation in text-to-image generation, which involves conditioning a diffusion model with orientation-aware compass tokens and using a lightweight encoder network to predict these tokens. The proposed method improves orientation control and achieves state-of-the-art results, even in complex scenarios and when combined with personalization methods....
