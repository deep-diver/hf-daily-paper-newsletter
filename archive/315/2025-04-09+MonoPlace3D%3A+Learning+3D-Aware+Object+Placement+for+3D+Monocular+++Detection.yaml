summary: MonoPlace3D is a system that learns a distribution over plausible 3D bounding boxes given a background scene, and then places synthetic objects based on the learned distribution to create realistic augmentations. It significantly improves the accuracy of monocular 3D detectors while being highly data efficient, as evaluated on KITTI and NuScenes datasets....
