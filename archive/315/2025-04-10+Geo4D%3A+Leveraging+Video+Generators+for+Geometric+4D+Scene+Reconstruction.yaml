summary: Geo4D is a method that uses video diffusion models for reconstructing dynamic scenes in 3D using only one camera. It uses synthetic data for training and can work with real data without additional training. It provides several types of geometric data, like points, depth, and rays, and combines them to create accurate and stable 4D reconstructions of long videos. It outperforms other methods designed for similar tasks....
