summary: This study proposes a new method, HoloPart, to tackle the problem of 3D part amodal segmentation, which involves breaking down a 3D shape into meaningful parts, even when some parts are hidden. HoloPart is a diffusion-based model that uses specialized attention mechanisms to ensure accurate and consistent results, outperforming existing methods and opening up new possibilities for applications like 3D content creation and editing....
