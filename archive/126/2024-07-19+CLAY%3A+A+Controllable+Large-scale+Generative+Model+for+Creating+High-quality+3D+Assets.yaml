summary: CLAY is a 3D geometry and material generator that transforms human imagination into intricate 3D digital structures. It uses a large-scale generative model with a multi-resolution VAE and a latent Diffusion Transformer to extract 3D priors from diverse geometries, and a multi-view material diffusion model for PBR textures. CLAY supports various inputs and can be used for controllable 3D asset creation....
