summary: This paper explores the impact of increasing the size of the datastore used by a retrieval-based language model (LM) on language modeling and downstream tasks. By constructing a 1.4 trillion-token datastore and studying the effect of improving the retriever and datastore quality filtering, the authors show that using larger datastores can significantly improve model performance for the same training compute budget. They recommend considering datastore size as an integral part of LM efficiency an...
