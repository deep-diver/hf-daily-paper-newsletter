summary: We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The hidden state is a machine learning model itself, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Our layers, called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, match or exceed the performance of strong baselines while being faster and able to keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens....
