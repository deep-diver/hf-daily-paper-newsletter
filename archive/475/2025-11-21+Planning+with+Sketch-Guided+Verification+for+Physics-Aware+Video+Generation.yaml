summary: The authors present a new method called SketchVerify that enhances motion planning for video generation by utilizing a loop that samples and verifies multiple candidate motion plans. This approach improves physical realism, long-term consistency, and efficiency compared to existing methods, by rendering each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch for easy evaluation and refinement....
