summary: This research challenges the notion that large amounts of data are necessary for complex reasoning in language models. Through experiments, a model called LIMO demonstrates superior mathematical reasoning capabilities with just 817 training samples, significantly outperforming previous models trained on 100x more data, suggesting that a few precise examples can effectively elicit complex reasoning in models with a comprehensive knowledge foundation....
