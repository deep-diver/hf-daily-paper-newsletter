summary: The authors present RoboScape, a physics-informed world model that improves video generation for robots by enhancing 3D geometry and motion dynamics. RoboScape's two key tasks, temporal depth prediction and keypoint dynamics learning, enable better physical plausibility in generated videos, which is useful for training robotic policies and evaluating their performance....
