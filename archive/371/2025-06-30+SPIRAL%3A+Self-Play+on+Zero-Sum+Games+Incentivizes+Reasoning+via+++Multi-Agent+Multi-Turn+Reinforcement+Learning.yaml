summary: The SPIRAL framework allows language models to learn sophisticated reasoning through self-play in zero-sum games, eliminating the need for human supervision. This approach improves math and general reasoning skills by developing cognitive patterns like systematic decomposition and expected value calculation, and can be further enhanced by training on multiple games....
