summary: MARBLE is a new benchmark for testing advanced AI models' ability to reason through complex problems involving multiple senses, such as sight and sound. The benchmark consists of two difficult tasks that require the AI to create and understand multi-step plans under various constraints. Most current AI models struggle with MARBLE, particularly in extracting information from visual inputs, highlighting the need for future improvements in this area....
