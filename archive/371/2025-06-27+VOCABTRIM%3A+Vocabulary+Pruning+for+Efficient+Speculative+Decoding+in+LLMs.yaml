summary: The authors present a technique called VocabTrim that reduces the vocabulary used in drafter models for speculative decoding, which helps improve generation speed in memory-limited environments. While this may slightly decrease the acceptance rate, it significantly lowers the drafting latency, leading to better performance on devices with limited memory, such as edge devices....
