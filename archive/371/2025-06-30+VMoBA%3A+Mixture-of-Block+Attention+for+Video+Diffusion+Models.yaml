summary: This study presents a new sparse attention mechanism called VMoBA, which is tailored for video diffusion models. VMoBA improves efficiency and generation quality by adapting to spatio-temporal patterns, prioritizing salient query-key interactions, and dynamically determining attended blocks. Results show significant speedup in training and inference for high-resolution video generation....
