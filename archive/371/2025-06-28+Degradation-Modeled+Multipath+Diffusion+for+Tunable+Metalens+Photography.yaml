summary: This study presents a new method for metalens photography that addresses the challenges of complex optical degradation and computational restoration difficulties. The proposed approach uses powerful natural image priors from pretrained models, allowing for high-fidelity and sharp image reconstruction without relying on large datasets or precise optical calibration, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods....
