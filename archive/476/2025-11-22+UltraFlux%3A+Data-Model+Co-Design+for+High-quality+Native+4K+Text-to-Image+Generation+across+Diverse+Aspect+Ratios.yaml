summary: The authors present UltraFlux, a powerful text-to-image generation model that can create high-quality native 4K images across various aspect ratios. They achieve this by addressing limitations in diffusion transformers through a data-model co-design approach, resulting in a model that outperforms existing open-source baselines and competes with a proprietary model....
