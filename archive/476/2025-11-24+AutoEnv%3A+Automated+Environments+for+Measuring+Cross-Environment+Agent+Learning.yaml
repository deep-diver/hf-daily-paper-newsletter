summary: The authors present AutoEnv, a framework that generates diverse and controllable environments at a low cost, and introduces AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments for measuring cross-environment agent learning. They then evaluate various learning methods on this dataset, finding that environment-adaptive selection of learning methods improves performance but does not scale infinitely, highlighting the need for further research in this area....
