summary: The authors propose a new method called Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD) that allows for precise and controllable separation of raster images into distinct layers, which can then be edited independently. CLD outperforms existing methods in decomposition quality and controllability, and the separated layers can be used in popular design tools like PowerPoint....
