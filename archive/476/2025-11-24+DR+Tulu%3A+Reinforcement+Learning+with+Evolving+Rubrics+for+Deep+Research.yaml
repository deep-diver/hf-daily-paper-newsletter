summary: The authors present a new training method, RLER, for deep research models that allows them to perform long-form, multi-step research tasks. They apply this method to create DR Tulu-8B, an open-source model that outperforms existing open models and matches proprietary ones, while being more cost-effective. The team also shares all their data, models, and code to help future research....
