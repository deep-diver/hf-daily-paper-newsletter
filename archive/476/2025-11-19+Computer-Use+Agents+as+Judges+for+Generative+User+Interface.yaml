summary: This study explores using Computer-Use Agents (CUA) as judges to help coding-oriented language models (Coder) design more efficient and reliable graphical user interfaces (GUI). The researchers developed a benchmark, synthesized tasks, and created a verifier to ensure the tasks' executability within their environment. They then proposed a framework where the Coder generates and revises websites, while the CUA evaluates their functionality and provides feedback, focusing on task solvability and n...
