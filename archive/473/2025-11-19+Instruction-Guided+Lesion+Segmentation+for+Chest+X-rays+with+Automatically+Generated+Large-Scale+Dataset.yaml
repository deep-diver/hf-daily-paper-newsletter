summary: A new method called instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS) has been developed for better segmentation of lesions in chest X-rays. This method uses simple instructions and a large-scale dataset called MIMIC-ILS, which contains over 1.1 million instruction-answer pairs, to improve the practical use of lesion segmentation models....
