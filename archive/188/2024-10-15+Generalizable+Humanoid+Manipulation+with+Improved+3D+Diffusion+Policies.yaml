summary: The paper introduces iDP3, a new 3D visuomotor policy that allows humanoid robots to perform autonomous manipulation in various real-world scenarios without needing camera calibration or point-cloud segmentation. This is achieved by using egocentric 3D visual representations, making it easier to deploy on mobile robots. The authors showcase the capabilities of iDP3 using a full-sized humanoid robot in diverse real-world scenarios, using only lab-collected data. Videos of the demonstrations are a...
