summary: 'This paper proposes a novel approach called Diffusion Curriculum (DisCL) that uses image guidance to generate a full spectrum of data for training deep neural networks. DisCL adjusts the image guidance level for each training stage, focusing on hard samples and improving model performance. The approach is applied to two challenging tasks: long-tail classification and learning from low-quality data. Extensive experiments showcase significant improvements in performance....'
