summary: BiGR is a new image generation model that uses small binary codes to improve both image generation and understanding. It has a unique way of creating binary codes and can make images quickly. It performs well in image generation and understanding tasks, and can do other tasks like image editing and interpolation without changes. This shows that BiGR is good at both creating and understanding images, which could lead to new developments in the field....
