summary: 'We present a new method called HART that can generate high-quality images up to 1024x1024 resolution, rivaling diffusion models. Our method, called the hybrid tokenizer, decomposes the image into two components: discrete tokens for the big picture and continuous tokens for the details. This approach improves image quality and reduces training costs, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models in terms of image quality and efficiency....'
