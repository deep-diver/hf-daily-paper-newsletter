summary: The paper presents ABC, a multimodal embedding model that aims to improve user control over representation by deeply integrating image features with natural language instructions using a vision-language model backbone. ABC outperforms existing models in various tasks, including image-to-text retrieval, classification, and VQA tasks, and is able to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems with the help of natural language control....
