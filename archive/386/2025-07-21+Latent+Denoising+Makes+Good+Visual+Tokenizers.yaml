summary: The study proposes a new method for creating visual tokenizers, which are used in generating images, by focusing on a process called denoising. The new method, called Latent Denoising Tokenizer, is trained to reconstruct clean images from noisy or partially hidden latent embeddings, and it consistently outperforms standard tokenizers in various generative models....
