summary: This study highlights that some machine learning problems, like mathematical reasoning and sequential decision-making, are inherently sequential and cannot be parallelized. The researchers suggest that to make further progress in AI, it's important to focus on improving both parallel and serial computation, as current parallel-centric architectures have limitations when it comes to these 'inherently serial' tasks....
