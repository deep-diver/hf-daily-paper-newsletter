summary: The authors present a new method called Segment Concept (SeC) for video object segmentation that utilizes high-level, object-centric representations instead of relying solely on appearance matching. SeC uses Large Vision-Language Models to integrate visual cues and construct robust conceptual priors, outperforming other methods by 11.8 points on a new benchmark called SeCVOS, which tests video object segmentation under challenging conditions....
