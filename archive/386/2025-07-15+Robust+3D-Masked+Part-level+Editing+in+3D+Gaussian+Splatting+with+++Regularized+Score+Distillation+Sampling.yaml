summary: The authors present RoMaP, a new framework for precise and drastic part-level modifications in 3D Gaussian editing. RoMaP uses a robust 3D mask generation module and a regularized SDS loss to produce high-quality edits while preserving contextual coherence and preventing unintended changes....
