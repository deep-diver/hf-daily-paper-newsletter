summary: The study presents a novel approach to represent continuous signed distance fields (SDF) in a discrete manner using Gaussian primitives, improving relighting quality in 3D Gaussian splatting without increasing memory usage or complexity. This method outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods by enforcing consistency between discrete samples and the underlying SDF through a projection-based consistency loss....
