summary: 'This paper introduces TOMG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the open-domain molecule generation capability of LLMs. It includes three tasks: molecule editing, molecule optimization, and customized molecule generation. The benchmark also includes an automated evaluation system and a new instruction tuning dataset called OpenMolIns. Llama3.1-8B performed better than other open-source general LLMs and even GPT-3.5-turbo on TOMG-Bench....'
