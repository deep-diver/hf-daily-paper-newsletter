summary: This paper introduces DI-PCG, a new and efficient method for generating high-quality 3D assets by using a lightweight diffusion transformer model to directly treat PCG parameters as the denoising target and the observed images as conditions to control parameter generation. DI-PCG is efficient and effective, requiring only 7.6M network parameters and 30 GPU hours to train, and demonstrates superior performance in recovering parameters accurately and generalizing well to in-the-wild images. The me...
