summary: This paper investigates the impact of synthetic data on language model training and proposes a method to synthesize data without causing model collapse. By pre-training language models with different proportions of synthetic data, the paper reveals a negative correlation between synthetic data and model performance. The paper also identifies distributional shift and over-concentration of n-gram features in synthetic data. To address these issues, the paper proposes token editing on human-produce...
