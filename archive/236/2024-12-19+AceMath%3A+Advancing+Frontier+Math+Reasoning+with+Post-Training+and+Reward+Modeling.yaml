summary: This paper introduces AceMath, a suite of math models that are trained to solve complex problems and evaluate their solutions. It also introduces a reward model that can identify the correct solutions. The models are trained using a process called supervised fine-tuning and are evaluated on a benchmark called AceMath-RewardBench. The resulting models outperform existing models and can be accessed at a provided link....
