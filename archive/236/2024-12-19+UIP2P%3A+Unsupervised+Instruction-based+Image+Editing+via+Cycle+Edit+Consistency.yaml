summary: We propose a new way to edit images without needing example images of the edits during training. Our method uses a process called Cycle Edit Consistency to make sure the edited images look good and follow instructions. This allows us to train on more types of data and makes our method better at making edits with high quality and precision. Our method is better than previous ones because it doesn't have biases and can use more types of data....
