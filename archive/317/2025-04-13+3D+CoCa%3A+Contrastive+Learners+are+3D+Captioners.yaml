summary: The paper proposes 3D CoCa, a unified framework for 3D captioning that combines contrastive vision-language learning and 3D caption generation in a single architecture, leveraging a frozen CLIP vision-language backbone, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder, and a multi-modal decoder for rich semantic priors, geometric context, and descriptive captions, respectively, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in 3D captioning performance....
