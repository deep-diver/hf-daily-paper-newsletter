summary: This research aims to improve slow-thinking capabilities in vision-language models using reinforcement learning. The proposed model, VL-Rethinker, enhances the GRPO algorithm with Selective Sample Replay to address vanishing advantages and introduces Forced Rethinking for explicit self-reflection, achieving state-of-the-art scores on multiple benchmarks....
