summary: The paper discusses the process of automatically creating EFAs (Executable Functional Abstractions) for advanced math problems. EFAGen, a method that conditions a Large Language Model (LLM) on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution, is developed to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. The EFAGen method is shown to create EFAs that remain faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variatio...
