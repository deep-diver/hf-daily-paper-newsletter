summary: This research compares reasoning-based LLMs, specifically DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o3, with their non-reasoning counterparts in machine translation and text summarization evaluation tasks. The experiments reveal that the benefits of reasoning capabilities are highly dependent on the model and task, with OpenAI o3-mini models showing consistent performance improvements and DeepSeek-R1 underperforming compared to its non-reasoning variant in most cases. The study also shows that distillation of reas...
