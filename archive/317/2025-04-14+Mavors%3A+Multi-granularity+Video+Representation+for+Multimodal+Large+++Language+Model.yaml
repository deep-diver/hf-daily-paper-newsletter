summary: The paper presents Mavors, a new method for understanding long videos in multimodal large language models. Mavors is designed to balance computational efficiency with retaining detailed visual information, using a combination of 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers for high-resolution spatial features, and a transformer-based dependency model with chunk-level rotary position encodings for establishing temporal coherence....
