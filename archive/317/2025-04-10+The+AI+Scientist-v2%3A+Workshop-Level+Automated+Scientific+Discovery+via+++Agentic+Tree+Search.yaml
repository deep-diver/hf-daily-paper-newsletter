summary: The AI Scientist-v2 is an advanced end-to-end agentic system that can autonomously perform scientific research, including formulating hypotheses, designing, executing and analyzing experiments, and writing manuscripts. Compared to its predecessor, it can generalize across machine learning domains without human-authored code templates, leverages a progressive agentic tree-search methodology, and integrates a Vision-Language Model (VLM) feedback loop for figure refinement. The system successfully ...
