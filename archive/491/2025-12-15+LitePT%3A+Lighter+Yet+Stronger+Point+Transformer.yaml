summary: Researchers analyzed the role of convolutional layers and attention blocks in 3D point cloud networks and found that convolutions are better for extracting low-level geometry in early stages, while attention is more efficient for capturing high-level semantics in deeper layers. They then developed a new, efficient 3D point cloud backbone called LitePT that uses convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers, resulting in a model that is faster, uses less memory, and has...
