summary: The study presents a new method called CAPTAIN to address the issue of diffusion models replicating training examples, which can lead to privacy and copyright problems. CAPTAIN reduces memorization by modifying latent features during denoising, using frequency-based noise initialization, identifying optimal denoising timesteps, localizing memorized regions, and injecting semantically aligned features from non-memorized images, all while preserving the prompt's intended meaning and visual quality...
