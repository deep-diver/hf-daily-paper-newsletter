summary: This study is the first to systematically adapt and compare state-of-the-art diffusion distillation techniques for text-to-image generation, focusing on the challenges that arise when transitioning from class labels to free-form language prompts. The researchers provide practical guidelines for input scaling, network architecture, and hyperparameters, along with an open-source implementation and pretrained models, paving the way for fast, high-quality, and resource-efficient image generation in ...
