summary: The study presents QwenLong-L1.5, a model with improved long-context reasoning and memory management. It uses a data synthesis pipeline for generating challenging tasks, stabilized reinforcement learning for long-context training, and a memory-augmented architecture for ultra-long contexts, outperforming its baseline and competitors on various benchmarks....
