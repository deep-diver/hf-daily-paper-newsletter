summary: This study presents a new method called ConsistencySolver to improve the speed and quality of image diffusion models. By using a lightweight, trainable solver optimized with reinforcement learning, ConsistencySolver generates better previews and maintains consistency with the final output, reducing user interaction time by nearly 50% while keeping generation quality....
