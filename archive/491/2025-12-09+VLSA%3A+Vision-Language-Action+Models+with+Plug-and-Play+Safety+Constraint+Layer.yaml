summary: This study presents AEGIS, a Vision-Language-Safe Action architecture that enhances safety in robotic manipulation tasks by adding a plug-and-play layer using control barrier functions, without compromising the models' original performance. The researchers also created a safety-critical benchmark and demonstrated AEGIS's superiority over existing methods, achieving a significant improvement in obstacle avoidance and task success rates....
