summary: The proposed HiScene framework generates high-quality 3D scenes with a hierarchical approach, ensuring compositional structure and aesthetic content by treating scenes as objects under isometric views. It handles occlusions and shadows with a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique and maintains spatial coherence via shape prior injection....
