summary: The paper presents a new denoising framework called Filter2Noise (F2N) for low-dose computed tomography (CT), which improves transparency and user control in denoising compared to existing methods. F2N uses an attention-guided bilateral filter and a single-image training strategy with a novel downsampling shuffle and self-supervised loss function, which outperforms the leading self-supervised single-image method by 4.59 dB PSNR on the Mayo Clinic 2016 low-dose CT dataset....
