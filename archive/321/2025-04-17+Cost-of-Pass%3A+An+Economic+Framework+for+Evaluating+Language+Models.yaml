summary: The paper presents an economic framework for evaluating language models by combining accuracy and inference cost, termed 'cost-of-pass'. The analysis reveals that lightweight models are most cost-effective for basic quantitative tasks, large models for knowledge-intensive ones, and reasoning models for complex quantitative problems. The 'frontier cost-of-pass' shows significant progress, particularly for complex quantitative tasks, and key innovations driving this progress are examined through c...
