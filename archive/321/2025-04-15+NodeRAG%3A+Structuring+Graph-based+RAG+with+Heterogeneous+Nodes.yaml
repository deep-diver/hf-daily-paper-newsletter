summary: The presented method, NodeRAG, introduces a graph-centric framework that uses heterogeneous graph structures for better integration of graph-based methodologies into the RAG workflow. It demonstrates superior performance over previous methods in terms of indexing time, query time, storage efficiency, and question-answering performance on multi-hop benchmarks and open-ended head-to-head evaluations with minimal retrieval tokens....
