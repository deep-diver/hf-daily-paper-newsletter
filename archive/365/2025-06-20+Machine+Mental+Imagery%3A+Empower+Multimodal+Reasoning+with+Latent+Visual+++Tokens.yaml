summary: The researchers propose a new framework called Mirage that enables vision-language models to reason with visual cues internally, without generating actual images. This approach improves multimodal reasoning tasks by training the model to use latent visual tokens along with text, and it outperforms existing methods without the need for heavy image-generation pre-training....
