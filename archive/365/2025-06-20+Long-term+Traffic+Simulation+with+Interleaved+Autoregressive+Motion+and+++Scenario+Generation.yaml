summary: The authors present InfGen, a model that combines motion simulation and scene generation for long-term traffic simulation, addressing the limitations of previous methods that only focus on initial agents in a scene. InfGen switches between modes to ensure stable simulation over time and outperforms other methods in long-term traffic simulation....
