summary: The paper presents HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that improves resource utilization for MoE models. HybriMoE uses a dynamic intra-layer scheduling strategy, an impact-driven inter-layer prefetching algorithm, and a score-based caching algorithm to balance workloads, address expert activation instability, and enhance inference performance....
