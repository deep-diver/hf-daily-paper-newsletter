summary: The paper presents a method to speed up the decoding time of reasoning models by utilizing parallelizability of certain tasks, enabling multiple tokens to be decoded per step within a single sequence without extra memory usage. Experiments show over 100% speedup in decoding time while keeping the same answer quality....
