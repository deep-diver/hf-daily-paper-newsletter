summary: The paper proposes a method called UnifyEdit for text-based image editing that balances fidelity and editability. It does this by optimizing diffusion latent and using attention-based constraints, along with a time-step scheduler to dynamically adjust these constraints, leading to better structure preservation and text alignment than other methods....
