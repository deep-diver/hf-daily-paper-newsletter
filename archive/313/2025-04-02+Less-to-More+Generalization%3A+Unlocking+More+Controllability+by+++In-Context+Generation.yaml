summary: This study addresses the challenges of data scalability and subject expansibility in subject-driven generation in image processing. The authors propose a data synthesis pipeline leveraging diffusion transformers' in-context generation capabilities to produce high-consistency multi-subject paired data and introduce UNO, a multi-image conditioned subject-to-image model, to ensure controllability in single-subject and multi-subject driven generation....
