summary: The CrossWordBench benchmark is introduced to evaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs and LVLMs through crossword puzzles, which require following semantic constraints from text clues and grid intersections. Results from evaluating over 20 models indicate that reasoning LLMs excel in the task by utilizing crossing-letter constraints, while LVLMs struggle, with their performance strongly correlating with grid-parsing accuracy....
