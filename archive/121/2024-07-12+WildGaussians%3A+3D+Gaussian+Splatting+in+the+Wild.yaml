summary: This paper introduces WildGaussians, a new approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By using robust DINO features and an appearance modeling module, WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while outperforming both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework....
