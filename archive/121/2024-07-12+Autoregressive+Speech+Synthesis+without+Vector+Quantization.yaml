summary: MELLE is a new approach for text-to-speech synthesis that generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text, without the need for vector quantization. It uses a regression loss and variational inference to improve output diversity and model robustness. MELLE outperforms other methods and offers a simpler approach....
