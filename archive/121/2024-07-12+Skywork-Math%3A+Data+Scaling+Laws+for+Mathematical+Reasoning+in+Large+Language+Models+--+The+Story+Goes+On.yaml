summary: This paper examines the factors that improve mathematical reasoning in large language models and introduces the Skywork-Math model series, which outperforms GPT-4 on certain benchmarks using only supervised fine-tuning data. The authors propose a two-stage data synthesis and model fine-tuning pipeline that includes three augmentation methods and a diverse seed problem set, ensuring both the quantity and quality of the Skywork-MathQA dataset across different difficulty levels. The authors provide...
