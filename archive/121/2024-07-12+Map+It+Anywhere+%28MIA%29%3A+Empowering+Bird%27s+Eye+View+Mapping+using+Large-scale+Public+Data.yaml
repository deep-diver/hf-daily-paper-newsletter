summary: This paper introduces a data engine called Map It Anywhere (MIA) that uses large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms to curate labeled map prediction data. The data engine is used to collect a dataset of 1.2 million pairs of FPV images and BEV maps, which are then used to train a model for BEV map prediction. The results show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing da...
