summary: Q-GaLore is a new approach that reduces memory usage by combining quantization and low-rank projection, surpassing the benefits of GaLore. It adaptively updates the gradient subspace based on its convergence statistics and maintains projection matrices in INT4 format. Q-GaLore achieves highly competitive performance with exceptional memory efficiency, enabling the training of a LLaMA-7B model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti with only 16 GB memory....
