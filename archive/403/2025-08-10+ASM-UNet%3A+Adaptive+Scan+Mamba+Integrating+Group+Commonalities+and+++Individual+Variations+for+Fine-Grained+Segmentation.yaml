summary: The authors present a new model, ASM-UNet, for accurately identifying small-scale anatomical structures in medical images, which is challenging due to individual variations. Unlike other models, ASM-UNet uses adaptive scan scores to adjust its scanning order based on both common and unique features, resulting in better performance in both large-scale and fine-grained segmentation tasks....
