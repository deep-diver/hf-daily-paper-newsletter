summary: This study presents a new Multi-Agent System architecture called AWorld that enhances agent stability when using multiple tools to solve complex problems. The system uses dynamic supervision and maneuvering mechanisms, where an Execution Agent collaborates with a Guard Agent to reduce errors and improve problem-solving robustness. Experiments show that this dynamic MAS system significantly outperforms single-agent and standard tool-augmented systems in terms of effectiveness and stability, earni...
