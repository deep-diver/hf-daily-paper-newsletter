summary: 'This study proposes a new method called Adaptive Meta Fine-Tuning (AMFT) that improves the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by balancing two types of rewards: one from supervised learning and another from reinforcement learning. AMFT dynamically adjusts this balance to optimize long-term performance, leading to better results on various challenging tasks and out-of-distribution scenarios compared to existing methods....'
