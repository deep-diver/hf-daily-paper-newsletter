summary: The paper proposes TRIP, a new method for image-to-video diffusion models that uses image noise prior to improve temporal coherence among frames by jointly triggering inter-frame relational reasoning and easing coherent temporal modeling via temporal residual learning. TRIP uses a residual-like dual-path scheme for noise prediction and dynamically merges reference and residual noise via attention mechanism. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TRIP....
