summary: The paper proposes a new method for generating background music from video inputs, using large-scale web videos with background music and a generative video-music Transformer. The method learns to align music with high-level video content, matches music beats with low-level motions, and captures fine-grained visual cues using a new temporal video encoder architecture. The model is trained on a newly curated dataset and outperforms existing approaches according to various evaluation metrics, incl...
