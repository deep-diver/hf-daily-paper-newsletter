summary: This paper proposes Hi3D, a video diffusion-based method for generating high-resolution 3D images from single images. It uses a 3D-aware prior and a video-to-video refiner to improve the resolution and texture details of the generated images. Hi3D demonstrates superior multi-view consistency and highly detailed textures in experiments....
