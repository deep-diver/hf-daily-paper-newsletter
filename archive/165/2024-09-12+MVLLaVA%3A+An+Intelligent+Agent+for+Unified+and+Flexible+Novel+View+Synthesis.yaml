summary: This paper presents MVLLaVA, an intelligent agent that combines multiple multi-view diffusion models with a large multimodal model (LLaVA) to generate new view images based on user instructions, making it adaptable to various input types and tasks such as single images, captions, and specific viewing azimuth changes. MVLLaVA's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments that showcase its robust performance and versatility in handling diverse novel view synthesis challenges....
