summary: The paper presents a scalable algorithm that uses Reinforcement Learning
  to improve diffusion models, making them more aligned with human preferences, fairness,
  and compositionality over millions of images. This approach substantially outperforms
  existing methods and improves pretrained Stable Diffusion models, generating samples
  preferred by humans 80.3% of the time....
