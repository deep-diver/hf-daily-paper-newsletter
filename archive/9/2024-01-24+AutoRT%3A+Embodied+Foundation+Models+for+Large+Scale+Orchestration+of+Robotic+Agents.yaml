summary: This paper presents AutoRT, a system that uses existing foundation models
  to scale up the deployment of operational robots in unseen scenarios with minimal
  human supervision. AutoRT utilizes vision-language and large language models to
  propose instructions to a fleet of robots, effectively collecting diverse data for
  robot learning....
