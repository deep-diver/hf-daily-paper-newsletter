summary: Trajectory Consistency Distillation (TCD) is introduced to address the limitations
  of the Latent Consistency Model (LCM) in generating clear and detailed images. TCD
  utilizes a trajectory consistency function and strategic stochastic sampling to
  reduce distillation errors and circumvent accumulated errors, resulting in better
  image quality at low and high NFEs....
