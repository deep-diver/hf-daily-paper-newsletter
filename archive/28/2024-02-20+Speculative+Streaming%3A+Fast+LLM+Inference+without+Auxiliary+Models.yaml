summary: This paper proposes a new method called Speculative Streaming that speeds
  up language model inference without the need for auxiliary models. It achieves this
  by changing the fine-tuning objective to predict future n-grams instead of just
  the next token. This method is faster and more efficient than other methods, making
  it suitable for resource-constrained devices....
