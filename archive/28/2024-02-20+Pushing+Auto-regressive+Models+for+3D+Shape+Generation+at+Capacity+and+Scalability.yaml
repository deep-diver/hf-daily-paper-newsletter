summary: The paper introduces a new framework called Argus3D that uses auto-regressive
  models to generate 3D shapes. It uses a labeled dataset of 900,000 objects and introduces
  a new way to represent 3D shapes as latent vectors to reduce computational costs,
  while preserving geometric details. The model can accept various conditioning inputs
  and scales up to a model with 3.6 billion parameters for high-quality, versatile
  3D generation....
