summary: Surgical video segmentation is a crucial task in computer-assisted surgery, and Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM-2) is a new model that uses Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) to improve efficiency and segmentation accuracy in surgical video analysis. SurgSAM-2 achieves a 3 times faster frame rate compared to SAM2 while delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality....
