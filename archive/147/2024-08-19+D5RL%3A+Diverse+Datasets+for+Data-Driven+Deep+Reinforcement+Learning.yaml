summary: The paper proposes a new benchmark for offline reinforcement learning called D5RL, which focuses on realistic simulations of robotic manipulation and locomotion environments. It includes a variety of data sources and supports both offline RL and online fine-tuning evaluation. The benchmark aims to facilitate further progress on both offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms....
