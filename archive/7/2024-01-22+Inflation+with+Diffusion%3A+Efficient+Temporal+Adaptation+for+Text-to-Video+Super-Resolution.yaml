summary: The paper proposes an efficient approach for text-to-video super-resolution
  using diffusion-based methods. They use an inflated architecture that incorporates
  a text-to-image SR model with a temporal adapter for coherence. The approach is
  tested on the Shutterstock video dataset, demonstrating good visual quality and
  temporal consistency. Visualizations of the results are available in a video format....
