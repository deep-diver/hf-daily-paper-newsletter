summary: This paper introduces LightIt, a method for controlling lighting in image generation. By conditioning the generation on shading and normal maps, LightIt enables high-quality image generation and lighting control in various scenes. The method also trains an identity-preserving relighting model, which performs on par with specialized relighting state-of-the-art methods....
