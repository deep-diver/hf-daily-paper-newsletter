summary: This paper proposes MVEdit, a 3D object synthesis method that uses ancestral
  sampling to jointly denoise multi-view images and output high-quality textured meshes.
  MVEdit achieves 3D consistency through a training-free 3D Adapter and is highly
  versatile and extendable, with potential applications in text/image-to-3D generation,
  3D-to-3D editing, and high-quality texture synthesis. It achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in both image-to-3D and text-guided texture generation tasks, and also
  intr...
