summary: This research introduces SV3D, a latent video diffusion model that uses a single image to generate high-resolution, multi-view orbital videos of 3D objects. The model improves upon previous methods by leveraging the generalization and multi-view consistency of video models, and adding explicit camera control for novel view synthesis. The model also proposes improved 3D optimization techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVS and 3D reconstruction compared to previous works....
