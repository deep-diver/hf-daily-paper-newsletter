summary: The study presents Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs) that can adaptively decide when to use extended thinking processes based on user query context, unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that always use thinking. LHRMs are trained using a two-stage pipeline and a new metric called Hybrid Accuracy, resulting in improved reasoning and general capabilities while reducing inefficiency due to unnecessary thinking....
