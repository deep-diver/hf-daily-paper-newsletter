summary: The study presents a new type of Neurosymbolic predictor, NeSyDMs, which improves upon existing models by using discrete diffusion to consider the relationships between symbols, rather than assuming they are independent. This method allows for better uncertainty quantification and generalization, outperforming other Neurosymbolic predictors in various tasks, such as visual path planning and autonomous driving....
