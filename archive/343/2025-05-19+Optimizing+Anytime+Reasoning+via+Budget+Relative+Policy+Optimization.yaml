summary: The researchers propose a new framework called AnytimeReasoner to improve the token efficiency and flexibility of large language models in reasoning tasks under varying token budget constraints. They introduce a novel variance reduction technique, Budget Relative Policy Optimization, to enhance the robustness and efficiency of the learning process, and empirical results show that their method outperforms the existing GRPO method in mathematical reasoning tasks....
