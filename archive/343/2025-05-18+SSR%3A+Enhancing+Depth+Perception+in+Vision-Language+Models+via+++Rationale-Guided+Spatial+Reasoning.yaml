summary: The study presents a new method called SSR that improves depth perception in Vision-Language Models by converting depth data into textual rationales, which enhances spatial reasoning. They also create a new dataset, SSR-CoT, for evaluating this method and demonstrate its effectiveness in multiple benchmarks, making VLMs better at understanding multi-modal information like humans....
