summary: This study examines how language models handle complex multi-hop question answering tasks by rearranging search results. The findings suggest that encoder-decoder models generally perform better than causal decoder-only models, and that optimizing the order of search results and enhancing causal decoder-only models with bi-directional attention can improve performance. Additionally, the research reveals a correlation between attention weights and correct answers, which can be used to improve lan...
