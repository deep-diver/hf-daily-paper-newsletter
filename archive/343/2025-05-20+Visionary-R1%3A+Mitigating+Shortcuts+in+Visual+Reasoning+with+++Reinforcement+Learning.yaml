summary: This paper presents Visionary-R1, a model that uses reinforcement learning and visual question-answer pairs to develop reasoning capabilities in visual language models, without explicit guidance. The model's success lies in its ability to interpret images before reasoning, which helps it avoid shortcuts and generalize better, outperforming other multimodal models on various benchmarks....
