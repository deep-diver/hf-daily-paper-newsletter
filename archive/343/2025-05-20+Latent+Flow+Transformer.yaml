summary: The authors propose a new method, Latent Flow Transformer, which replaces multiple layers in transformers with a single learned operator, making the model more efficient. They also introduce an algorithm to improve the preservation of connections in flow-based methods, and their method outperforms skipping layers in experiments, demonstrating its feasibility and potential....
