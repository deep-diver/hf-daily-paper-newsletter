summary: The paper proposes CoMat, a fine-tuning strategy for diffusion models to address misalignment between text prompts and images. It uses an image-to-text concept matching mechanism and attribute concentration module to improve alignment and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks without using image or human preference data....
