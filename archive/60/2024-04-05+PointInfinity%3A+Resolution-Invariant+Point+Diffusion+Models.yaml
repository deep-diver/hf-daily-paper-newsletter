summary: This paper introduces PointInfinity, a family of point cloud diffusion models that can generate high-resolution point clouds with state-of-the-art quality. The models use a transformer-based architecture with a fixed-size, resolution-invariant latent representation, allowing for efficient training and high-resolution generation during inference. They also show that scaling the resolution beyond the training resolution improves the fidelity of generated point clouds....
