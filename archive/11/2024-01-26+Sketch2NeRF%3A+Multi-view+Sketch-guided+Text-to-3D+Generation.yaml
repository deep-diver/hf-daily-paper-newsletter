summary: A method called Sketch2NeRF is introduced that enables fine-grained control over 3D content generation using sketches. It uses pretrained 2D models to supervise the optimization of a 3D scene represented by a neural radiance field, and achieves high-fidelity results that are consistent with both the sketches and text prompts....
