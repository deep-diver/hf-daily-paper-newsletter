summary: This paper proposes a new architecture (BootPIG) that allows users to provide reference images of an object to guide the appearance of a concept in the generated images using pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. BootPIG is trained using data generated from pretrained text-to-image models, chat agents, and image segmentation models, and can be trained in approximately 1 hour, outperforming existing zero-shot methods but comparable to test-time finetuning approaches. It also improves the use...
