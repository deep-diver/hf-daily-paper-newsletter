summary: This paper introduces a new method, 'Diffuse to Choose,' to balance efficiency
  and accuracy in virtual product visualizations using a diffusion-based image-conditioned
  inpainting model. It combines features from the reference image and a perceptual
  loss function to enhance item details, outperforming existing methods....
