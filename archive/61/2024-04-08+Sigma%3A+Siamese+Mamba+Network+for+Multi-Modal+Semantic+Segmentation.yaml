summary: This paper introduces Sigma, a Siamese Mamba network for multi-modal semantic segmentation that uses thermal and depth information along with traditional RGB to improve AI agents' perception and scene understanding in adverse conditions. Sigma achieves global receptive fields coverage with linear complexity and effectively selects essential information from different modalities. It outperforms other methods on RGB-Thermal and RGB-Depth segmentation tasks....
