summary: This paper proposes a framework for fine-tuning consistency models via reinforcement learning (RL) for faster and higher quality text-to-image generation. The framework, called Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Model (RLCM), outperforms RL fine-tuned diffusion models in terms of training speed, image quality, and inference time....
