summary: The authors present Ultra3D, a fast and high-quality 3D generation framework that improves upon existing methods by reducing computational inefficiencies. They use a compact representation for initial object layout and a localized attention mechanism called Part Attention to efficiently refine voxel features, resulting in significant speed improvements without sacrificing quality....
