summary: The study presents a new method called Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM) that improves the quality of one- and few-step generative models by regulating the transition between diffusion timesteps. TVM offers better performance and stability through minimal architectural changes and an efficient fused attention kernel, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet datasets with low FID scores....
