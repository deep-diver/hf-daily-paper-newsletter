summary: FedRand is a new framework for training vision-language models in a decentralized way that improves data privacy by randomly selecting subparameters of LoRA from the server and keeping the rest as private parameters. This method reduces the risk of exposing client-side VLM parameters and enhances data privacy, while still achieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters....
