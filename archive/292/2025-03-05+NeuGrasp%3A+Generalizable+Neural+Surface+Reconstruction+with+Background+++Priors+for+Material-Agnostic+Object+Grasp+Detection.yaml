summary: NeuGrasp is a neural surface reconstruction method that uses background priors for material-agnostic object grasp detection, especially in challenging scenes with transparent and specular objects, by integrating transformers and global prior volumes for multi-view feature aggregation and employing residual feature enhancement and an occupancy-prior volume for better spatial perception....
