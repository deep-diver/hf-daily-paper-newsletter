summary: The paper presents a novel method named SinRef-6D for estimating the 6D pose of an unfamiliar object using only a single reference view. This method uses iterative camera-space point-wise alignment and state space models to effectively handle large pose discrepancies and capture long-range dependencies and spatial information, achieving performance comparable to CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods....
