summary: The paper discusses the use of state-based methods as a more effective alternative to prompt-based methods for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in State Space Models (SSMs). They propose a new state-based PEFT method, State-offset Tuning, which directly affects the state at the current timestep, leading to more effective adaptation....
