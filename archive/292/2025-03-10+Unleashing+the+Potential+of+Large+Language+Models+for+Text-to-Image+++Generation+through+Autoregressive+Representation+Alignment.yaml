summary: The paper introduces Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training method for large language models (LLMs) that enables them to generate images from text without changing their architecture. ARRA uses a loss function and a special token to align the model's hidden states with visual representations, allowing the model to learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining its original autoregressive nature. The method works well with popular LLMs and outperforms direct fine-t...
