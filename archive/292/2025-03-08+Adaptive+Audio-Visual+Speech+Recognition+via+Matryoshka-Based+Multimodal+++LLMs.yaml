summary: The paper presents Llama-MTSK, a Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition, which allows for flexible adaptation of audio-visual token allocation based on computational constraints without sacrificing performance. This approach, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, encodes audio-visual representations at multiple granularities within a single model and introduces three LoRA-based Matryoshka strategies for efficient fine-tuning of the LLM, resulting i...
