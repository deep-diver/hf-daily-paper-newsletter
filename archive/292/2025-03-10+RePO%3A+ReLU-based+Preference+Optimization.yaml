summary: 'The proposed RePO algorithm streamlines preference optimization for LLMs by eliminating the need for a hyperparameter through two advances: (1) retaining the reference-free margins of SimPO but removing beta through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that filters trivial pairs. Empirically, RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, needing only one hyperparameter to tune....'
