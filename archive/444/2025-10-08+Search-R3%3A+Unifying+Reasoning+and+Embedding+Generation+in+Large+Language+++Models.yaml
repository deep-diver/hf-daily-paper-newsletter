summary: 'The researchers developed a new framework called Search-R3 that improves the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for retrieval tasks by having them generate search embeddings as part of their reasoning process. They achieved this through three methods: supervised learning, reinforcement learning for embedding optimization, and a specialized RL environment for efficient training, resulting in significant performance improvements on various benchmarks....'
