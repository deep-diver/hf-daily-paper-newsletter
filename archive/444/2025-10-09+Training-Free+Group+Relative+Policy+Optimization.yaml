summary: The study presents a new method called Training-Free GRPO, which enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains without making any changes to the model's parameters. This approach uses experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is learned from a small amount of data and integrated into the LLM to improve its behavior. The method has been tested and shown to outperform fine-tuned small LLMs in mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks....
