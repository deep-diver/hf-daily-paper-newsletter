summary: The study presents a new method to help robots rotate a variety of objects in their grasp, closing the gap between how well they can do this in simulations versus the real world. This is achieved by training a policy in simulation and then using a joint-wise dynamics model to adapt it to real-world conditions, requiring minimal real-world data and demonstrating impressive generality and robustness in real-world tests....
