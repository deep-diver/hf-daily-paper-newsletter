summary: This study combines driving models and generative world models to assess the realism of generated videos using E2E drivers and investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. The research demonstrates that synthetic data from video generation models can effectively enhance E2E model generalization, providing a cheaper alternative to real-world data collection for expanding autonomous vehicle services....
