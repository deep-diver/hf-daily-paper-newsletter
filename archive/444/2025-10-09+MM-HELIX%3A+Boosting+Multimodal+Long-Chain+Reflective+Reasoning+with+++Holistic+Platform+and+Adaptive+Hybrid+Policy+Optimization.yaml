summary: This study explores the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to perform long-chain reflective reasoning, a crucial skill for solving complex real-world problems. The researchers create a new benchmark with 1,260 challenging tasks and find that existing MLLMs struggle with this type of reasoning. They then introduce a new training strategy called Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO) that helps models learn and generalize reflective reasoning, resulting in significant performa...
