summary: The authors present a new framework called R2RGen that generates real-world 3D data for robotic manipulation without relying on simulations. This method enhances data efficiency and is suitable for mobile manipulation tasks by using a single source demonstration and an annotation mechanism to create diverse and complex scenarios, while ensuring the generated data matches real-world sensor distributions....
