summary: The study presents a new method called Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO) that improves the training speed of diffusion models by 20 times compared to existing techniques. DGPO directly learns from group-level preferences, eliminating the need for inefficient stochastic policies and enabling the use of faster deterministic ODE samplers, resulting in superior performance on various reward metrics....
