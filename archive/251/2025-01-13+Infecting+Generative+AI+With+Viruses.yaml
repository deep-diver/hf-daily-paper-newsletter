summary: This study tests the security of generative AI by embedding a test file in JPEG images and running it on various platforms. It finds that the file can be uploaded, manipulated, and executed without detection. The study uses techniques like base64 encoding and string reversal to mask the file and successfully extracts it using Python-based manipulation within the AI environments. This research extends Microsoft's security testing framework to evaluate AI and language model security boundaries....
