summary: The paper proposes a novel object-centric representation to bridge the gap between high-level reasoning and low-level precision required for robotic manipulation. It introduces a dual closed-loop, open-vocabulary robotic manipulation system that ensures robust, real-time control without requiring fine-tuning. The approach demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization across diverse robotic manipulation tasks, highlighting its potential for automating large-scale simulation data generation....
