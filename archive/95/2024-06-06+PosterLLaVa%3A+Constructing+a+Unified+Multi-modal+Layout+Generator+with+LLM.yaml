summary: The abstract presents a new method for automated graphic layout generation using a unified framework that leverages a multi-modal large language model (MLLM). This approach is efficient for large-scale applications and flexible for varying design requirements, and it has achieved state-of-the-art performance on public multi-modal layout generation benchmarks. The code and datasets will be made publicly available....
