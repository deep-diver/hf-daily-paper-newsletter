summary: This paper proposes a new method called Proxy Token Diffusion Transformer (PT-DiT) for efficiently modeling global visual information in diffusion transformers. It uses a smaller number of representative tokens to capture global semantics and injects them into all latent tokens via cross-attention. The paper also introduces window and shift window attention to address limitations in detail modeling. The Qihoo-T2X family of models, which includes models for T2I, T2V, and T2MV tasks, is built on P...
