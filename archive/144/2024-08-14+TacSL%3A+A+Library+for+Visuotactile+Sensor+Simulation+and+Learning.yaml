summary: We present TacSL, a library for simulating and learning from visuotactile sensors. TacSL can simulate visuotactile images and contact-force distributions over 200 times faster than previous methods, within the Isaac Gym simulator. It also provides a learning toolkit containing multiple sensor models, contact-intensive training environments, and algorithms for policy learning. We introduce a novel online reinforcement-learning algorithm called asymmetric actor-critic distillation, designed to lea...
