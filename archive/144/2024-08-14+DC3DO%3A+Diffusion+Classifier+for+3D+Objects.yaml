summary: We use 3D diffusion models to classify objects without additional training, resulting in a 12.5 percent improvement compared to multiview approaches. Our model, DC3DO, is trained on ShapeNet and can classify chairs and cars from point clouds. This demonstrates the potential of generative models in 3D object classification....
