summary: This paper proposes two strategies to adapt a general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system to preserve emotional cues in speech. The first strategy involves integrating emotion embeddings from a pre-trained emotion encoder, while the second strategy is an emotion compensation strategy as a post-processing step. The proposed strategies are also expected to be useful for preserving other target paralinguistic attributes....
