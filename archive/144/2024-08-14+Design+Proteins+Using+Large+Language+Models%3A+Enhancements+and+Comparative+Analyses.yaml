summary: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) in generating protein sequences. The authors use pre-trained LLMs to produce valid protein sequences with a small dataset of 42,000 human protein sequences. The adapted models demonstrate efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models, and the authors commit to making the trained versions of the models publicly available to foster transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology....
