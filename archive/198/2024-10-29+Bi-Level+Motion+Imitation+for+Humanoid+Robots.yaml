summary: The paper proposes a bi-level optimization-based imitation learning framework that alternates between optimizing the robot policy and the target motion capture (MoCap) data. The framework uses a generative latent dynamics model to generate reference motions and regularize the bi-level motion imitation process. The method enhances the robot policy by modifying reference motions to be physically consistent, as demonstrated in simulations with a realistic model of a humanoid robot....
