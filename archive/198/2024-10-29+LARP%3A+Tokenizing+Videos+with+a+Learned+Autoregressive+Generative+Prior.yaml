summary: LARP is a new video tokenizer that uses learned holistic queries to gather information from visual content and capture more global and semantic representations. It supports an arbitrary number of discrete tokens and integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model to align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks. LARP achieves state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark and enhances the compatibility of AR models with...
