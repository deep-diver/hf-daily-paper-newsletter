summary: This paper proposes Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings, which group utterances in dialogs based on their communicative and informative functions (i.e., the actions they represent). D2F allows for modeling dialogs as continuous trajectories in a latent space with distinct action-related regions. The paper also introduces a novel soft contrastive loss for pre-training D2F and demonstrates superior performance compared to standard supervised contrastive loss....
