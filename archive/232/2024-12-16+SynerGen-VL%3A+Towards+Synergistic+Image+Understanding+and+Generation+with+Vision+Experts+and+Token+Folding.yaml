summary: This paper proposes SynerGen-VL, a simple yet powerful encoder-free MLLM that can both understand and generate images. It uses a token folding mechanism and vision-expert-based progressive alignment pretraining strategy to improve performance while reducing training complexity. SynerGen-VL achieves or surpasses the performance of existing encoder-free unified MLLMs with comparable or smaller parameter sizes, and it's a promising path for future unified MLLMs....
