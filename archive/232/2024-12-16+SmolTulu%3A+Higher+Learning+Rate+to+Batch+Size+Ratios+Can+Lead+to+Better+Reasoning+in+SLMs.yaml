summary: We trained a language model called SmolTulu-1.7b-Instruct, which is based on Tulu 3 and SmolLM2-1.7B, and found that using higher learning rates and batch sizes can improve its performance on reasoning tasks. It outperforms other models with less than 2 billion parameters on instruction following and mathematical reasoning tasks....
