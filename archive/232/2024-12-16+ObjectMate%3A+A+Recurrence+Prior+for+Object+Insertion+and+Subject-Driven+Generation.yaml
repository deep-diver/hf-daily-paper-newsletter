summary: This paper proposes a method that uses recurring objects in large unlabeled datasets to create massive supervision, enabling the training of a simple text-to-image diffusion architecture for object insertion and subject-driven generation. The method outperforms existing methods in identity preservation and photorealistic composition without requiring slow test-time tuning....
