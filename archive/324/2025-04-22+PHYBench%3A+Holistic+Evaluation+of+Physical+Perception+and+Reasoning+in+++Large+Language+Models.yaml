summary: Researchers created a new benchmark called PHYBench, with 500 real-world physics problems, to test large language models' understanding and reasoning of physical processes. They also developed a new evaluation metric, Expression Edit Distance Score, to compare model reasoning processes and results with human experts, finding that models still struggle with complex physical reasoning tasks....
