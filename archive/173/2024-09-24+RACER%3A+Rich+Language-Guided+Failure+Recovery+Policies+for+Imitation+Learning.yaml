summary: We propose a method called RACER to improve robotic manipulation by combining failure recovery data with rich language descriptions to enhance robot control. RACER uses a vision-language model as an online supervisor and a language-conditioned visuomotor policy as an actor to predict the next actions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art Robotic View Transformer on various tasks and environments....
