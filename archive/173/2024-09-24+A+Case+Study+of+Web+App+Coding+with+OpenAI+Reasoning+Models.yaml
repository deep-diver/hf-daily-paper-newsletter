summary: This paper compares the performance of OpenAI's o1-preview and o1-mini reasoning models with other frontier models on a web app coding task. The o1 models perform well on a single-task benchmark but struggle with a more challenging benchmark and atypical test cases. The authors suggest that the performance variability is due to the models' ability to understand instructions and that coding success for reasoning models relies on a strong base model and fine-tuning....
