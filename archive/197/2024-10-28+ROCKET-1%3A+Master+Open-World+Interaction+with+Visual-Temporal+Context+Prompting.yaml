summary: This paper proposes a new method called visual-temporal context prompting to help vision-language models (VLMs) better understand and interact with open-world environments. The method uses object segmentation from past and present observations to guide policy-environment interactions, and it helps VLMs solve complex tasks that require spatial understanding. The authors trained a low-level policy called ROCKET-1 using this method, and they demonstrated its effectiveness in the Minecraft game....
