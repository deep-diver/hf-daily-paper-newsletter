summary: This paper presents SUPE, a method that uses unlabeled prior data to learn efficient exploration strategies in reinforcement learning. SUPE first extracts low-level skills using a VAE and then pseudo-relabels unlabeled trajectories using an optimistic reward model. Finally, SUPE uses these transformed examples as additional off-policy data for online RL to learn a high-level policy that composes pretrained low-level skills to explore efficiently. Empirical results show that SUPE outperforms prio...
