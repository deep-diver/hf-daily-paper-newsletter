summary: A new method for training audio captioning models is introduced. The method involves transferring knowledge from a large model to a smaller one, specifically focusing on the encoder part of the model. This results in a smaller, faster model that performs as well as the larger one, even in situations with limited data. The method leverages audio-only data into training and can be accessed through an online demo....
