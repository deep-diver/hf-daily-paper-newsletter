summary: SciCode is a benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to generate code for solving scientific research problems. It contains 338 subproblems decomposed from 80 main problems and includes optional descriptions and gold-standard solutions. Even the best-performing model can only solve 4.6% of the problems in the most realistic setting, showing the progress and challenges of scientific AI....
