summary: This paper proposes ControlNet++, a novel approach to improve the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models by optimizing pixel-level cycle consistency between generated images and conditional controls. A novel reward strategy is introduced to avoid the extensive costs associated with image sampling, allowing for more efficient reward fine-tuning....
