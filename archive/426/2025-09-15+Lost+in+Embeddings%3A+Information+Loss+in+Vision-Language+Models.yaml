summary: 'The study examines how vision-language models process visual inputs and the potential information loss during this process. They use two methods to analyze and quantify this loss: evaluating semantic information preservation and directly measuring information loss through reconstruction, revealing substantial distortion in visual representations that impacts model performance....'
