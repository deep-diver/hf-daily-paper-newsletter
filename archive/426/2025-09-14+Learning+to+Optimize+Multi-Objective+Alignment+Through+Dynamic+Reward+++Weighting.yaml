summary: This study presents two new methods, hypervolume-guided weight adaptation and gradient-based weight optimization, to improve multi-objective reinforcement learning. These methods adaptively adjust reward weights during training, allowing for better exploration of Pareto fronts and more optimal solutions compared to traditional fixed-weight interpolation approaches....
