summary: This study shows that the locality in deep diffusion models comes from the statistical properties of image datasets, not from the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks. They prove this by demonstrating that a linear denoiser has similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers, which arise from pixel correlations in natural image datasets....
