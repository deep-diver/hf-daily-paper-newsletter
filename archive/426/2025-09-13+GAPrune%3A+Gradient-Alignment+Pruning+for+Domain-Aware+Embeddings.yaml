title: 'GAPrune: Gradient-Alignment Pruning for Domain-Aware Embeddings'
thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.10844
summary: The study presents GAPrune, a pruning framework for domain-specific embedding models that balances domain importance and general linguistic foundation. By using Fisher Information and gradient alignment, GAPrune maintains performance close to dense models and outperforms baselines in experiments on FinMTEB and ChemTEB benchmarks....
