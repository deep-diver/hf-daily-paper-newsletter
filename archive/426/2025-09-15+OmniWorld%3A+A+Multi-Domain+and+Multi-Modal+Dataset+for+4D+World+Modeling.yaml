summary: The paper presents OmniWorld, a large-scale, multi-domain, and multi-modal dataset designed for 4D world modeling. This dataset, which includes a new OmniWorld-Game dataset and curated public datasets, offers richer modality coverage and more realistic dynamic interactions compared to existing synthetic datasets. It aims to advance the development of general-purpose 4D world models by providing a challenging benchmark and significantly improving performance in 4D reconstruction and video generat...
