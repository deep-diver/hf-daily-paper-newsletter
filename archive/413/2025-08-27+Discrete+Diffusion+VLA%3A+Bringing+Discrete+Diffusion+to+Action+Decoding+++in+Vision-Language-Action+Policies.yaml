summary: The study presents Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified transformer policy that uses discrete diffusion to model action chunks in VLA models, improving consistency and enabling robust error correction. This method achieves better performance than autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines, supporting precise action modeling and consistent training....
