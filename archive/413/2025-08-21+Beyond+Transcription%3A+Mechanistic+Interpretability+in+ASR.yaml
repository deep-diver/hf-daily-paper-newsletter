summary: The study explores how well-known interpretability methods like logit lens, linear probing, and activation patching can be used to understand automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. By applying these techniques, the researchers discovered new information about the internal workings of ASR, such as the specific interactions causing repetition errors and the semantic biases present in acoustic representations, which could help make ASR systems more transparent and reliable....
