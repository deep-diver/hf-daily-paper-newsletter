summary: This study presents a solution called HeteroScale for efficiently managing resources in GPU-intensive tasks like serving Large Language Models. HeteroScale addresses challenges in modern Prefill-Decode architectures by balancing the use of heterogeneous hardware and network resources, resulting in increased GPU utilization and reduced GPU-hours used in a large-scale production environment....
