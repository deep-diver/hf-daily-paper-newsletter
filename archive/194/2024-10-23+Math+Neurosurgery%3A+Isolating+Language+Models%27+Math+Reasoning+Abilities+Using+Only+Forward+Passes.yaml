summary: Math Neurosurgery is a method that identifies math-specific parameters in Large Language Models and removes those important for general language tasks, which allows for targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior. This method can be used to understand how models encode math reasoning and improve a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K while leaving non-math behavior unaltered....
