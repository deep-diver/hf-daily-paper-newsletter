summary: This paper introduces EvoPress, a new and general approach for dynamic compression of large language models that is provably optimal in a given input range. It has provable convergence, low sample and evaluation complexity, and sets new state-of-the-art results for dynamic compression of Llama, Mistral, and Phi models.
