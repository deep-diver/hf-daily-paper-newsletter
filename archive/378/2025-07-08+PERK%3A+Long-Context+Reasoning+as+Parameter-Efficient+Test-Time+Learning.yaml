summary: The study presents PERK, an efficient method for long-context reasoning that uses minimal memory during inference by encoding context into a lightweight model adapter. PERK significantly outperforms traditional long-context reasoning methods, improving accuracy by up to 90% for smaller models and 27% for larger ones, while also being more robust to complexity, length, and information location in contexts....
