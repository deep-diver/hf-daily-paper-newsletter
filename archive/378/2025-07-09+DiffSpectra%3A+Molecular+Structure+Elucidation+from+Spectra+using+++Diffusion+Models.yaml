summary: DiffSpectra is a new framework that uses AI to identify molecules from their spectra, focusing on both 2D and 3D structures. It's better than previous methods because it considers 3D geometry, uses various types of spectra, and can suggest new molecules, making it a powerful tool for chemistry and drug development....
