summary: This study evaluates various linear attention models and their performance in hybrid architectures for processing long sequences in language models. The researchers found that certain linear attention models, like selective gating and hierarchical recurrence, significantly improve recall performance when combined with full attention layers, and recommend specific hybrid models for achieving Transformer-level recall efficiently....
