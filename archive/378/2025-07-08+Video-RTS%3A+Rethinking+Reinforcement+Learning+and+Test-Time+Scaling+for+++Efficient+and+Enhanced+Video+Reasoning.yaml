summary: The authors propose Video-RTS, a new method for video reasoning that uses data-efficient reinforcement learning and a video-adaptive test-time scaling strategy. This approach reduces the need for extensive training data and annotations, while also improving inference efficiency, resulting in better performance compared to existing models....
