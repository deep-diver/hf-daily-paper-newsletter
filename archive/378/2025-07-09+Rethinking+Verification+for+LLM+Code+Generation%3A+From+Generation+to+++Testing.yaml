summary: The authors propose a new method, SAGA, which combines human expertise with LLM reasoning to generate more comprehensive and high-quality test cases for code generation, addressing the limitations of current evaluation benchmarks. They introduce TCGBench to study test-case generation and demonstrate that SAGA significantly outperforms existing methods in detecting faults and improving verifier accuracy....
