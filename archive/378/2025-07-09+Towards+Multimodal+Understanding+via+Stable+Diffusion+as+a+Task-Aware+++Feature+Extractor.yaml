summary: This research explores using text-to-image diffusion models as visual encoders in multimodal large language models to capture fine-grained details in images, improving image-based question-answering capabilities. The study also identifies and proposes a solution for a leakage phenomenon, where the language model inadvertently recovers information from the original diffusion prompt, and demonstrates the model's promise in vision-centric tasks through evaluation on general and specialized benchmar...
