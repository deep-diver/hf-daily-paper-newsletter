summary: This research presents MotionMillion, the largest human motion dataset with over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences, and MotionMillion-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating zero-shot motion generation. The study introduces a scalable model with 7B parameters that demonstrates strong generalization to complex and unseen motions, advancing the field towards zero-shot human motion generation....
