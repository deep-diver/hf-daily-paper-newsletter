summary: The study presents PictSure, a framework that emphasizes the importance of image embeddings in in-context learning for few-shot image classification. The researchers explore various visual encoder types, pretraining objectives, and fine-tuning strategies, finding that out-of-domain performance heavily depends on how the embedding models are pretrained, allowing PictSure to outperform existing models in such scenarios....
