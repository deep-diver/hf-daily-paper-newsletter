summary: This study presents Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a new method that enhances the efficiency of training reasoning models like Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing policy updates and limiting response length. T-PPO's two main contributions are Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation from incomplete responses and a computationally optimized mechanism that speeds up training without sacrificing performance, which was demonstrated to improve ...
