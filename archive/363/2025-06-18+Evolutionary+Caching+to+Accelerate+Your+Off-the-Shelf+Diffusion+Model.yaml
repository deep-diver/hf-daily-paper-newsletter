summary: The authors present a genetic algorithm called ECAD that improves the inference speed of diffusion models used for image generation by learning efficient caching schedules without modifying the model parameters. ECAD offers significant speedups, allows customization of quality-latency trade-offs, and works well with different models and resolutions, as demonstrated by its superior performance in various benchmarks compared to previous methods....
