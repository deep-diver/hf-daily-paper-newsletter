summary: The paper proposes a novel temporal consistency verification method where verifiers improve their judgments iteratively, rather than one-round or multi-model debate approaches. The method achieves better performance than baseline methods across various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, even with smaller 7B/8B distilled models outperforming larger 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench....
