summary: Event-based vision has drawn increasing attention due to its unique characteristics, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. It has been used in video super-resolution (VSR) recently to enhance the flow estimation and temporal alignment. Rather than for motion learning, we propose in this paper the first VSR method that utilizes event signals for texture enhancement. Our method, called EvTexture, leverages high-frequency details of events to better recover texture regions in VSR...
