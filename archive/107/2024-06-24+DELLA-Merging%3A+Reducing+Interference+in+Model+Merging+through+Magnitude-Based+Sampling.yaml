summary: DELLA-Merging is a new model merging technique that combines the capabilities of multiple models into one, using a pruning technique called MAGPRUNE. MAGPRUNE ranks parameters by magnitude and assigns higher dropout probabilities to lower magnitude parameters. DELLA-Merging shows an average improvement of 2.4 points over baseline methods and 11.1 points over the no-pruning baseline on three different expert models and corresponding benchmark datasets.
