summary: This method uses a diffusion model to create stylized images and a NeRF model to refine the 3D scene. It uses a sliced Wasserstein loss and a pre-trained CNN model to guide the style transfer process. The pipeline allows users to test different styles and preview the result before fine-tuning the NeRF model. The method can transfer various artistic styles to real-world 3D scenes with good quality....
