summary: The paper proposes a method called In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL) that helps large-scale generative models create their own prompt examples from sub-optimal demonstrations. ICAL uses a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback to improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented models. The method significantly improves performance in dialogue-based instruction following, multimodal web agents, and action anticipation tasks....
