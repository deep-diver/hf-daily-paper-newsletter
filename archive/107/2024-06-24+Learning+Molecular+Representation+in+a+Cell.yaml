summary: 'This paper introduces the InfoAlign approach to learn molecular representations in cells through an information bottleneck method. It integrates molecules and cellular response data into a context graph and optimizes the encoder''s latent representation with a minimality and sufficiency objective. Empirically, the paper validates representations from InfoAlign in two downstream tasks: molecular property prediction and zero-shot molecule-morphology matching....'
