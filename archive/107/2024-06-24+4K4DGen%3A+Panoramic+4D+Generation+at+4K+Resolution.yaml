summary: This paper presents a method for generating immersive 4D experiences from a single panorama, allowing users to interact with dynamic scenes in 360-degree views at 4K resolution. The method uses a pipeline that facilitates natural scene animations and optimizes a set of 4D Gaussians using efficient splatting techniques for real-time exploration. The paper also proposes a novel Panoramic Denoiser that adapts generic 2D diffusion priors to animate consistently in 360-degree images, transforming the...
