summary: The paper presents a new method for editing 3D scenes using a single image. It involves manipulating 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image. The method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy to handle long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. It also includes a novel masking strategy to identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. The method is designed to be more flexible and produce better r...
