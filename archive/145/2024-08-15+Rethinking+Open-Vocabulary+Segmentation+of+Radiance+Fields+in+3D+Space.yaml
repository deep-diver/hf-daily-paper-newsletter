summary: The paper proposes a new approach to understand the 3D semantics of a scene modeled by NeRFs and 3DGS by directly supervising the 3D points and introducing a 3D querying and evaluation protocol. The approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without relying on multi-scale language embeddings and can be applied to 3DGS for real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy....
