summary: This paper proposes PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model that captures periodic features of waveform signals using a period-aware flow matching estimator and a multi-period estimator. It also introduces a single period-conditional universal estimator to reduce computational costs and uses discrete wavelet transform for high-frequency modeling. Experimental results show that PeriodWave outperforms previous models in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks....
