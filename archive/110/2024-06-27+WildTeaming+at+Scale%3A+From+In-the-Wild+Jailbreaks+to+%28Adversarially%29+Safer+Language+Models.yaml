summary: WildTeaming is an automatic framework that mines user-chatbot interactions to find and systematically explore novel ways to break language models, revealing previously unidentified vulnerabilities. It creates an open-source safety dataset with 262K prompt-response pairs to train models to balance safeguarding without over-refusal, handle vanilla and adversarial queries, and maintain general capabilities. This dataset significantly improves existing safety resources and helps study the effects of...
