summary: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a new learning paradigm that trains neural implicit functions as hypernetworks to learn the continuous weight manifold of neural networks. This allows for the synthesis of parameters for various network configurations without retraining, and maintains full-size performance even at a 75% compression rate....
