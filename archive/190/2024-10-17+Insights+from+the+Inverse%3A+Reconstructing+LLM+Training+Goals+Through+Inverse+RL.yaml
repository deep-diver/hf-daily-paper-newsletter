summary: The paper proposes a method to understand the decision-making process of large language models (LLMs) by using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their hidden reward functions. The research analyzes the non-identifiability of reward functions and the relationship between model size and interpretability, and suggests potential improvements to the RLHF process. The IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in better performance on toxicity benchmarks. This...
