summary: The paper introduces ChroKnowBench, a dataset to evaluate chronological knowledge of language models in various domains. They also present ChroKnowledge, a framework to update non-parametric chronological knowledge in language models. They find that the ability to recall temporal knowledge varies depending on the data format the model was trained on, and that models often recall knowledge in parts or have a cut-off at temporal boundaries. They use ChroKnowPrompt, an in-depth prompting method, to...
