summary: We propose a simplified framework to train continuous-time consistency models (CMs) at a large scale, reaching 1.5B parameters on ImageNet 512x512. Our training algorithm using only two sampling steps achieves FID scores of 2.06 on CIFAR-10, 1.48 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.88 on ImageNet 512x512, narrowing the gap in FID scores with the best existing diffusion models to within 10%....
