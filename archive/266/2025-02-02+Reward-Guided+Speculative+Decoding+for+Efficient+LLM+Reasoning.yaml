summary: The suggested method Reward-Guided Speculative Decoding (RSD) improves LLM inference efficiency by combining a lightweight draft model with a more potent target model. It uses a process reward model to assess decoding steps and decide whether to invoke the target model, aiming for a balance between computational cost and output quality....
