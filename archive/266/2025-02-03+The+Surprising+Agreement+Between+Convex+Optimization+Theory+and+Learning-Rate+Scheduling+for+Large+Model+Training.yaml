summary: The study demonstrates that learning-rate schedules for large model training closely match a performance bound from non-smooth convex optimization theory. They derive a bound for the constant schedule with linear cooldown and show that the close match between optimization theory and practice can be utilized for learning-rate tuning, leading to noticeable improvements for training Llama-type models....
