summary: The authors propose a simple method for test-time scaling in language models, using a small dataset of questions and reasoning traces, and a technique called budget forcing to control test-time compute. They demonstrate that their model, s1, outperforms OpenAI's model by up to 27% on competition math questions, and can be scaled to improve performance further....
