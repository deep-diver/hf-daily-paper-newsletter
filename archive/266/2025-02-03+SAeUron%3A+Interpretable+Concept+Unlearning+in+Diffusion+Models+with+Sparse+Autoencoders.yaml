summary: This study presents SAeUron, a new technique for eliminating undesirable concepts from text-to-image diffusion models using sparse autoencoders. It shows that SAeUron outperforms existing methods in removing concepts, such as objects or styles, and can block multiple concepts with a single autoencoder, while preventing unwanted content generation, even under adversarial attacks....
