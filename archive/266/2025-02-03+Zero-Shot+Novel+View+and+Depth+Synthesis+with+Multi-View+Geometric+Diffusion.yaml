summary: The paper presents MVGD, a diffusion-based architecture for pixel-level generation of images and depth maps from novel viewpoints using sparse posed images. MVGD uses raymap conditioning and multi-task learning for image and depth map generation, and is trained on over 60 million multi-view samples with a novel strategy for efficient training of larger models....
