summary: This paper introduces a new method for creating high-quality, animatable 3D full-body avatars from a single image. They use a large-scale dataset of diverse, photorealistic human images and a feed-forward transformer model to predict a 3D human Gaussian representation. The estimated Gaussians can be animated without post-processing, and the method can reconstruct photorealistic humans at 1K resolution from a single input image using a single GPU instantly....
