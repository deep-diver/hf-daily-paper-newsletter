summary: This paper introduces a new method called CLEAR that makes image generation faster by reducing the complexity of a type of model called a Diffusion Transformer. The method works by limiting the interactions between different parts of the image to a smaller area, which makes the model run faster. The authors show that their method can generate images that are just as good as the original model, but much faster. They also show that their method can be used with different types of models and can wo...
