summary: This paper proposes OREO, an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning, which reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks and embodied agent control. The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available, and the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the ...
