summary: The authors present a new method for improving language model safety at inference time without changing the model's weights. Their approach, called MetaSC, uses a meta-critique mechanism to update safety prompts adaptively, leading to better performance against adversarial requests and in general safety tasks compared to fixed prompts and static defenses....
