summary: The paper proposes a new method, Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation that is faster and more efficient than traditional autoregressive models. By decomposing video content into blocks and predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP achieves better FVD scores and an 11x speedup compared to a vanilla Next-Token Prediction model....
