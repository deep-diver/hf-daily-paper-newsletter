summary: This paper introduces EasyRef, a method that allows diffusion models to be conditioned on multiple reference images and text prompts. It uses a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to capture consistent visual elements within multiple images and adapters to inject the MLLM's representations into the diffusion process. EasyRef outperforms both tuning-free methods and tuning-based methods, achieving superior aesthetic quality and robust zero-shot generalization across diverse domains....
