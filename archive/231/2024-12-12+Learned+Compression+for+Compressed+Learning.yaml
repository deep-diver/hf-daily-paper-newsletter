summary: WaLLoC is a new compression method that combines linear transform coding with nonlinear dimensionality-reducing autoencoders. It outperforms existing methods and is efficient for mobile computing and remote sensing. It can be used for compressed-domain learning in tasks like image classification, colorization, document understanding, and music source separation. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://ut-sysml.org/walloc....
