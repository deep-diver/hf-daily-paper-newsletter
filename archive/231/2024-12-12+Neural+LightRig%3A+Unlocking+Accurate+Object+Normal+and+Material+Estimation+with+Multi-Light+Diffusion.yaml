summary: Neural LightRig is a new method that improves the accuracy of estimating object surfaces and materials by using a diffusion model to create different lighting conditions and a U-Net model to predict the results. This outperforms existing methods and can produce realistic lighting effects. Code and data are available at https://projects.zxhezexin.com/neural-lightrig....
