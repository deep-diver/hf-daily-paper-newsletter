summary: FreeSplatter is a new method for creating 3D models from sparse-view images without needing to know the camera positions. It uses a special kind of AI called a transformer to turn the images into a 3D model. This model can be used to create 3D models of both objects and scenes, and it is better than other methods at both creating the models and figuring out the camera positions. It can also be used to help with other tasks like creating 3D models from text or images....
