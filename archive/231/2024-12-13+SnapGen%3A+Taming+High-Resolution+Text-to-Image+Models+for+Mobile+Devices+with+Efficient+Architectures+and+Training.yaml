summary: We developed a small and fast text-to-image model that generates high-quality images on mobile devices. We did this by reducing model parameters, using knowledge distillation, and integrating adversarial guidance. Our model, SnapGen, can generate 1024x1024 px images in 1.4 seconds and outperforms large-scale models with billions of parameters....
