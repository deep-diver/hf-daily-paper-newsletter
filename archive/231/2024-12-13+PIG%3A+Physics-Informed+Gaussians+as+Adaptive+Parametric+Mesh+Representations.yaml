summary: The paper proposes Physics-Informed Gaussians (PIGs), a new approach to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using neural networks. PIGs combine feature embeddings with Gaussian functions and trainable parameters for their positions and shapes, allowing for dynamic adjustment during training and improving the accuracy of the model....
