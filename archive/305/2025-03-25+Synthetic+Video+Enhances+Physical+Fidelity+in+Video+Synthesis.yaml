summary: The paper presents a method to improve physical fidelity in video generation models by utilizing synthetic videos generated from computer graphics pipelines, which respect real-world physics. Through a proposed solution for integrating synthetic data and transferring its physical realism, the model significantly reduces unwanted artifacts, as demonstrated in experiments on three representative tasks....
