summary: The paper presents ReaRAG, a factuality-enhanced reasoning model that improves the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) by integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). ReaRAG selects actions from a predefined action space and executes a query against the RAG engine for the 'Search' action, returning the result as observation to guide subsequent reasoning steps....
