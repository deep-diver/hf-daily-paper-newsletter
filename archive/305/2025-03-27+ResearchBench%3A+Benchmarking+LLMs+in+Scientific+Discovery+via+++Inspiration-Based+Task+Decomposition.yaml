summary: A new benchmark is created to assess large language models' ability in scientific discovery, focusing on sub-tasks like inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and ranking. The benchmark is validated using papers from 2024, and results show that LLMs can effectively find inspirations, acting as 'research hypothesis mines' for generating innovative hypotheses with little human input....
