summary: Feature4X is a universal framework that enables 4D tasks using only monocular video input. It distills 2D foundation model features into an explicit 4D feature field using Gaussian Splatting, allowing for novel view segment anything, geometric and appearance scene editing, and free-form VQA across all time steps....
