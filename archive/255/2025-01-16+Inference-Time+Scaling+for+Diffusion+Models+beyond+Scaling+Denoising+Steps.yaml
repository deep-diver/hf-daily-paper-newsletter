summary: This paper explores the inference-time scaling behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigates how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation. Specifically, they consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises for the diffusion sampling process, and through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation benchmarks, they find that increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial imp...
