summary: The paper proposes a method to improve the scalability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD). This allows for customizable rendering quality based on hardware capabilities, providing tradeoffs between rendering quality and memory usage. The method can be applied to different 3DGS frameworks and is demonstrated to generalize well....
