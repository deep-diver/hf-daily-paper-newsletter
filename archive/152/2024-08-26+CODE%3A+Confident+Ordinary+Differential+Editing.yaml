summary: CODE is a new method for image synthesis that can handle noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images. It uses a diffusion model to enhance images and doesn't require any special training or assumptions about the corruption in the conditioning image. CODE also has a new way of editing images based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and a method to ignore certain pixels or information to improve the restoration process....
