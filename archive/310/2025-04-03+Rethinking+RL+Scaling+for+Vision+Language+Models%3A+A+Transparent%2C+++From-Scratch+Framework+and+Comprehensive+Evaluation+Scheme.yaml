summary: 'This work presents a clear, self-contained framework for reinforcement learning in vision-language models, addressing the challenge of reproducibility and accessibility. It also proposes a standardized evaluation scheme, discovering key findings through experiments: response length varies with random seeds, reflection is linked to output length, and RL outperforms supervised fine-tuning in generalization....'
