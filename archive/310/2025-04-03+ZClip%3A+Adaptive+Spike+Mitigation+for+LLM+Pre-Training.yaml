summary: The proposed ZClip algorithm is an adaptive gradient clipping method that addresses gradient instability and loss spikes during LLM pre-training, dynamically adjusting the clipping threshold based on gradient norms over time, and using z-score-based anomaly detection to identify and mitigate large spikes, improving efficiency and learning without requiring manual intervention....
