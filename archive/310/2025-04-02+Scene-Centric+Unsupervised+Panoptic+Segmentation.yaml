summary: This study presents a new method for unsupervised panoptic segmentation, which can understand complex scenes without using manually annotated data. The approach combines visual representations, depth, and motion cues to create high-resolution panoptic pseudo labels on scene-centric data, and then it utilizes both pseudo-label training and a panoptic self-training strategy....
