summary: This study applies Sparse Autoencoders to Vision-Language Models to improve monosemanticity and interpretability. By using SAEs to intervene on a CLIP vision encoder, the researchers demonstrate the ability to directly steer output from multimodal LLMs without altering the underlying model....
