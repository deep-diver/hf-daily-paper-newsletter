summary: The proposed method, NeuralGS, uses neural fields to represent 3D scenes compactly, reducing the model size by 45 times without sacrificing visual quality. It does this by encoding 3D Gaussian attributes with MLPs and using a clustering strategy for a more efficient compression of original 3DGS....
