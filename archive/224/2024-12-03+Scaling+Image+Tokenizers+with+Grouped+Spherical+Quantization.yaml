summary: We propose Grouped Spherical Quantization (GSQ) for image tokenizers, which improves reconstruction quality and enables efficient scaling. Our findings reveal distinct behaviors at high and low spatial compression levels, and we show that GSQ can represent high-dimensional latent spaces more efficiently....
