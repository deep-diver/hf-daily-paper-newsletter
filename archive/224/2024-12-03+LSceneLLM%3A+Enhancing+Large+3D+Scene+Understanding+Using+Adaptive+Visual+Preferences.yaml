summary: Researchers propose LSceneLLM, a framework that uses an LLM's visual preference to identify task-relevant areas in large 3D scenes, then uses a scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in these areas. They also introduce XR-Scene, a benchmark for large scene understanding tasks, and show that their method outperforms existing methods....
