summary: This paper introduces a new way to improve the performance of Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) by using a method called Masked Referring Image Segmentation (MaskRIS). This method uses image and text masking, followed by Distortion-aware Contextual Learning (DCL) to make the model more robust to things like occlusions and incomplete information. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms existing methods in both fully supervised and weakly supervised settings, and achieves new state-...
