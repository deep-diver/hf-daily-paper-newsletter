summary: The paper introduces a new method for controlling video generation by using motion trajectories, which can be sparse or dense and encode any number of trajectories. This method can be used to control camera and object motion, transfer motion, and edit images. The results show realistic physics and emergent behaviors, and the method outperforms previous methods in quantitative evaluations and human studies....
