summary: This paper proposes a new method for autoregressive image generation that uses wavelet image coding and a modified language transformer. The wavelet coding organizes image details from coarse to fine, while the transformer learns statistical correlations within the token sequences. The results show that this method can improve the image generation process when conditioned on it....
