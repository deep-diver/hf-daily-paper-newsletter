summary: This study proposes a novel guided tree search algorithm, called LiteSearch, to improve the performance of LLMs on complex mathematical reasoning tasks without increasing the computational resources required. It achieves this by considering the search progress and using a value network to select the most promising tree node within the allocated computational budget. Experiments show that LiteSearch offers competitive performance while reducing computational costs compared to baseline methods....
