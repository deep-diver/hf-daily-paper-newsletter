summary: We propose RegMix, a method to automatically identify an effective data mixture for language model pre-training by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix involves training small models with diverse data mixtures and fitting a regression model to predict their performance. With the fitted regression model, we simulate the top-ranked mixture and use it to train a large-scale model. Our method outperforms human selection and achieves results that match or surpass DoReMi, while utilizing only 1...
