summary: Our method generates 3D stereoscopic videos using a monocular video generation model, warping it into camera views with estimated video depth and a novel frame matrix video inpainting framework. We improve video inpainting quality by re-injecting disocclusion boundaries and validate our method's efficacy on various generative models....
