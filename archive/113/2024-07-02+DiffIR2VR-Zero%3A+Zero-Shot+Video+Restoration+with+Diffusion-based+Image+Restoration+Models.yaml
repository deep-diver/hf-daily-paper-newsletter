summary: This paper presents a new method for video restoration using pre-trained image restoration models. It combines a hierarchical token merging strategy for keyframes and local frames with a hybrid correspondence mechanism. The method outperforms trained models in generalization across diverse datasets and extreme degradations, and works with any 2D restoration diffusion model. This research leads to more efficient and widely applicable video restoration technologies....
