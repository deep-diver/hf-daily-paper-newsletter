summary: The paper proposes a new method called Step-Controlled DPO (SCDPO) to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) on mathematical reasoning tasks. SCDPO creates negative samples of mathematical reasoning rationales that start making errors at a specified step and uses these samples to train the models. The method is applied to both code-integrated and chain-of-thought solutions, and it consistently improves the performance compared to naive DPO on three different SFT models. SCDPO is...
