summary: This study examines the limitations of rule-based and model-based verifiers in mathematical reasoning, finding that rule-based ones struggle with different answer formats and model-based ones are prone to being hacked. The research aims to provide insights for creating more reliable reward systems in reinforcement learning by highlighting these unique risks....
