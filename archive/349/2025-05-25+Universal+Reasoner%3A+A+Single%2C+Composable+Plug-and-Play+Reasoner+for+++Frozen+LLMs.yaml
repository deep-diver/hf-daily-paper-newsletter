summary: The authors present a new, lightweight reasoning module called Universal Reasoner (UniR) that can be used with any frozen Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its reasoning skills. UniR is trained independently and can be combined with any LLM during inference by adding its output logits, allowing for modular composition and strong weak-to-strong generalization, as demonstrated in mathematical reasoning and machine translation tasks....
