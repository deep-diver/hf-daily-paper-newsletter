summary: The authors present EPiC, a framework for learning efficient video camera control that creates precise anchor videos without needing expensive camera trajectory annotations. EPiC uses masked source videos for training and a lightweight ControlNet module for integration with pretrained video diffusion models, resulting in state-of-the-art performance for image-to-video camera control tasks with fewer parameters, training steps, and less data....
