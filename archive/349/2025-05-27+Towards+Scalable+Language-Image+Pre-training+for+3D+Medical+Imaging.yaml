summary: This study presents a new method called HLIP that efficiently pre-trains language-image models for 3D medical imaging like CT and MRI scans by using a lightweight attention mechanism. HLIP can train on large, uncurated datasets, leading to improved performance and state-of-the-art results in various medical imaging benchmarks....
