summary: This study examines the impact of different allocation strategies on the long-context capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and proposes a new method called HoPE. HoPE is a Hybrid of Position Embedding that improves VLM performance in long contexts by introducing a hybrid frequency allocation strategy and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism. The results of extensive experiments show that HoPE outperforms existing methods in long video understanding and retrieval tasks....
