summary: The authors present a new framework called Chain-of-Zoom that enables super-resolution models to handle extreme magnifications beyond their training range. This is achieved by breaking down the task into smaller, manageable steps using a pre-trained model and supplementing each step with text prompts generated by a vision-language model, which are then aligned with human preferences. The result is a significant improvement in image quality and detail at magnifications up to 256 times the origina...
