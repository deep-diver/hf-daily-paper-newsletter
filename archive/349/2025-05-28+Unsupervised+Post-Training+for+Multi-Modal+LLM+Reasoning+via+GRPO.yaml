summary: This study presents MM-UPT, a new method for improving multi-modal large language models without the need for expensive, manually annotated data. MM-UPT uses a stable and scalable online RL algorithm, GRPO, and a self-rewarding mechanism to enhance the reasoning ability of models like Qwen2.5-VL-7B, even outperforming some supervised methods....
