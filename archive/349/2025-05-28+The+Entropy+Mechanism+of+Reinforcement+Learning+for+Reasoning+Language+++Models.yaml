summary: This study explores why language models struggle with reasoning in reinforcement learning due to a lack of exploration, and finds that this issue is linked to a decrease in policy entropy. The researchers develop a relationship between entropy and performance, and propose two techniques, Clip-Cov and KL-Cov, to manage entropy and improve exploration, leading to better results....
