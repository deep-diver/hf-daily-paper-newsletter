summary: The authors present a new method called RICO to improve the accuracy and completeness of image recaptioning by refining captions through visual reconstruction. RICO uses a text-to-image model to create a reference image from the caption, identifies discrepancies between the original and reconstructed images, and iteratively refines the caption. To reduce computational cost, they also introduce RICO-Flash, which learns to generate captions like RICO using DPO. Experiments show that RICO significa...
