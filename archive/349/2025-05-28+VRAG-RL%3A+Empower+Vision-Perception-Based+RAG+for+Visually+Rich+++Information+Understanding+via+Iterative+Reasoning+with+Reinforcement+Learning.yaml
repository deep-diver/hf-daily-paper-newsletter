summary: This study presents a new framework, VRAG-RL, that uses reinforcement learning to help models understand and reason through visually rich information. By enabling models to interact with search engines and optimize their reasoning process, the framework addresses limitations in traditional text-based and vision-based methods, leading to improved performance in real-world applications....
