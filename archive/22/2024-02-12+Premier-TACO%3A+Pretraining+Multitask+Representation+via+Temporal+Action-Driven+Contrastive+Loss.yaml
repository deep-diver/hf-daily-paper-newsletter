summary: This paper presents a new approach called Premier-TACO for learning better representations in sequential decision-making tasks. It uses a subset of multitask offline datasets for pretraining, then fine-tunes with a few expert demonstrations. It uses an efficient negative example sampling strategy and improves few-shot imitation learning on various control benchmarks....
