summary: The study presents MarsRL, a new framework for multi-agent reasoning systems that uses reinforcement learning with agentic pipeline parallelism to optimize multiple agents together. MarsRL improves the accuracy of the Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 model on reasoning tasks by introducing agent-specific rewards and efficient training methods, making multi-agent reasoning systems more effective and applicable to open-source models....
