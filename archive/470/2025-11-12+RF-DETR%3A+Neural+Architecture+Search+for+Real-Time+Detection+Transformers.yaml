summary: The authors present RF-DETR, a lightweight, efficient detector that uses neural architecture search to find the best balance between accuracy and speed for any given dataset. By fine-tuning a pre-trained network and evaluating thousands of configurations, RF-DETR significantly outperforms existing real-time detectors on COCO and Roboflow100-VL datasets, achieving up to 48.0 AP on COCO....
