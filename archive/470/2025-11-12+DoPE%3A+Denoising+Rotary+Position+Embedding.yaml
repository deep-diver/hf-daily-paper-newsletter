summary: The research proposes a new method, Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), to improve the length extrapolation of Transformer models. DoPE addresses the attention sink phenomenon by denoising positional encoding and restoring balanced attention patterns, leading to significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts....
