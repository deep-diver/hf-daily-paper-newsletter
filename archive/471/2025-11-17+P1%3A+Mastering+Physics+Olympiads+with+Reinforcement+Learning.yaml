summary: Researchers have developed a family of open-source physics reasoning models called P1, which excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems using reinforcement learning. The most notable model, P1-235B-A22B, achieved Gold-medal performance at the International Physics Olympiad and won 12 gold medals out of 13 international/regional physics competitions in 2024/2025....
