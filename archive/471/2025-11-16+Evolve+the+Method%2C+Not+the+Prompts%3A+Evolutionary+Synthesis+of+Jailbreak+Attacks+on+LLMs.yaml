summary: The study presents EvoSynth, a new framework for automated red teaming of Large Language Models that can autonomously invent and evolve novel attack algorithms, rather than just refining existing ones. EvoSynth's unique code-level self-correction loop allows it to iteratively improve its own attack logic, resulting in a new state-of-the-art Attack Success Rate of 85.5% against robust models and more diverse attacks compared to existing methods....
