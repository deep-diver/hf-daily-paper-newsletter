summary: The study presents a new method called Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS) that helps Vision-Language Models (VLMs) adapt to new situations without losing performance. STS is lightweight, fast, and requires minimal changes to the model, making it a promising technique for improving VLMs in real-world applications....
