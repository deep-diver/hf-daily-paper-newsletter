summary: This research proposes a new approach for denoising diffusion models, suggesting that predicting clean data is more effective than predicting noised quantities, as it aligns with the manifold assumption that natural data lies on a low-dimensional manifold. The proposed method, called JiT, uses large-patch Transformers directly on pixels without tokenization, pre-training, or extra loss, achieving competitive results on ImageNet at high resolutions....
