summary: The study presents spatial speech translation, a new concept for hearables that translates different languages in real-time while maintaining the original speaker's direction and voice characteristics. This is achieved by addressing technical challenges in blind source separation, localization, and binaural rendering, resulting in improved translation accuracy and spatial awareness in noisy environments....
