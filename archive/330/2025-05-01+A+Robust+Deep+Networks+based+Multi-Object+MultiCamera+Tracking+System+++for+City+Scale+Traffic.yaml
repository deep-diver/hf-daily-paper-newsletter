summary: The study presents a deep learning-based framework for tracking multiple objects across various cameras in city-scale traffic, using Mask R-CNN for detection, transfer learning for re-identification, and ResNet-152 with Deep SORT for tracking. The framework, evaluated on the 5th AI City Challenge dataset, demonstrates strong performance with an IDF1 score of 0.8289 and precision/recall scores of 0.9026/0.8527, effectively handling challenges like occlusions, illumination variations, and shadows....
