summary: This study explores how LLM agents can enhance their performance in sequential decision-making tasks by learning from their own successful experiences, rather than relying on task-specific knowledge engineering. The researchers find that building a database of self-generated examples significantly improves test performance on various benchmarks, and further enhancements through database and exemplar-level selection lead to even better results, matching or exceeding more complex approaches that u...
