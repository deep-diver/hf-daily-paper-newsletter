summary: The authors present a new two-stage framework for efficient reasoning in large language models, combining long and short reasoning models and using bi-level preference training to select the best reasoning style. This approach significantly reduces inference costs and the average length of reasoning by more than 50% on multiple mathematical datasets, demonstrating the potential for adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency....
