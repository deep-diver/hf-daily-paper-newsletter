summary: 'This paper introduces DynamicCity, a novel 4D LiDAR generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality LiDAR scenes that capture the temporal evolution of dynamic environments. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models: 1) a VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation, and 2) a DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. The code will be released to facilitate future research....'
