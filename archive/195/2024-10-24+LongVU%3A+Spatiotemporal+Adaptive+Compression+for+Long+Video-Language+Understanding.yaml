summary: LongVU is a method that reduces the number of video tokens while preserving visual details of long videos, allowing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to better understand and analyze video content. It uses cross-modal query and inter-frame dependencies to adaptively reduce temporal and spatial redundancy in videos, and consistently surpasses existing methods across various video understanding benchmarks, especially on hour-long video understanding tasks....
