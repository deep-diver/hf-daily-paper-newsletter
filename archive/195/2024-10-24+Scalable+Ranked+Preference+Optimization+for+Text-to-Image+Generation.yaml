summary: This paper proposes a scalable method for generating large-scale synthetic datasets for text-to-image models using a pre-trained reward function, which eliminates the need for human annotation and improves dataset collection efficiency. The method also introduces RankDPO to enhance preference-based optimization methods using ranking feedback, resulting in improved performance on prompt-following and visual quality....
