summary: This research explores the best model architecture and training methods for unified multimodal models that understand and generate images. The study introduces a new approach using a diffusion transformer to create rich image features, improving training efficiency and quality. The resulting model, BLIP3-o, outperforms existing models in various image understanding and generation tasks and is fully open-source for future research....
