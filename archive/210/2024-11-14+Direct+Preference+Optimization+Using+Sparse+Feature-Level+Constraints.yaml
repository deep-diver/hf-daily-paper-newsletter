summary: The paper presents a new method called Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO) to make it easier and more stable to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. FPO uses Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and feature-level constraints to make the alignment process efficient and sparse. The results show that FPO improves the win rate by 5.08% and reduces the computational cost compared to existing methods, making it a good solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignmen...
