summary: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved substantial progress in processing long contexts but still struggle with long-context reasoning. Existing approaches typically involve fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data, which depends on annotations from human experts or advanced models like GPT-4, thus restricting further advancements. To address this issue, we investigate the potential for LLMs to self-improve in long-context reasoning and propose \ours, an approach specifically designed for this p...
