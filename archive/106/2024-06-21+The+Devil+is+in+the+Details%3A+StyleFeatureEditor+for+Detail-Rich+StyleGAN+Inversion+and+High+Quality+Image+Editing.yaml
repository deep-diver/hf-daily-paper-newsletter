summary: The paper proposes a new method called StyleFeatureEditor to improve the quality of image reconstruction and editing using StyleGAN. The method combines the use of w-latents and F-latents to preserve fine image details during editing, and a new training pipeline is introduced to accurately edit F-latents. The method outperforms existing encoding approaches in terms of reconstruction quality and can edit challenging out-of-domain examples. Code is available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/St...
