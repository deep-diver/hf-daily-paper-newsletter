summary: 'A new dataset format, PIN, is introduced to enhance the training of Large Multimodal Models by addressing perceptual and reasoning errors in interpreting complex visual data and deducing multimodal relationships. PIN is built on three foundational principles: knowledge intensity, scalability, and support for diverse training modalities. The dataset, PIN-14M, contains 14 million samples derived from diverse sources and aims to improve model robustness against common multimodal training pitfalls....'
