summary: The paper proposes a method to enhance visual commonsense in language models by generating multiple images based on input text prompts and integrating them into the model's decision-making process. The method employs a late-fusion layer to combine visual features with the output of a pre-trained language model. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines, and improvements in both visual common sense and traditional NLP benchmarks when applied t...
