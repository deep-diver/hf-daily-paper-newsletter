summary: This study investigates the use of source-aware metrics for evaluating speech translation systems, focusing on generating textual proxies for audio input when transcripts are unavailable. The authors propose a re-segmentation algorithm and compare ASR transcripts and back-translations as synthetic sources, finding that ASR is more reliable for lower word error rates, while back-translations are a cheaper alternative. The research advances more accurate and consistent evaluation methods for speec...
