summary: The authors present SIMS-V, a framework that uses 3D simulators to generate spatially-rich video data for training multimodal language models, which helps improve their spatial reasoning abilities. Through experiments, they identify three key question categories that are most effective for developing transferable spatial intelligence, allowing for efficient training of a 7B-parameter video LLM that outperforms larger baselines and proprietary models on real-world spatial reasoning benchmarks....
