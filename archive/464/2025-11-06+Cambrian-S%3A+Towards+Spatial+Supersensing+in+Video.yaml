summary: The authors propose a new benchmark called VSI-SUPER to measure progress in spatial supersensing, which includes understanding, remembering, and predicting events in videos. They find that current models struggle with this benchmark, suggesting that improving spatial supersensing requires models that can anticipate and organize experiences, not just process visual information....
