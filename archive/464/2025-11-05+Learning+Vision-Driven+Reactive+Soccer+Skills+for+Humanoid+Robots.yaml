summary: This study presents a unified reinforcement learning-based controller that helps humanoid robots learn reactive soccer skills by integrating visual perception and motion control. The controller, which extends Adversarial Motion Priors to real-world environments, enables robots to recover privileged states from imperfect observations and coordinate perception and action, resulting in strong reactivity and consistent, robust soccer behaviors in various scenarios....
