summary: This paper proposes a new method for editing real images using text-to-image generative models. The method uses a self-guidance mechanism to preserve the overall structure and local appearance of the input image without requiring time-consuming hyperparameter tuning or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. The proposed method provides a fast and high-quality editing mechanism, and it achieves a better trade-off between editing quality and preservation of the original image compared to existing met...
