summary: The paper introduces a new metric called Character Detection Matching (CDM) for evaluating formula recognition models. Unlike previous metrics, CDM evaluates formula recognition based on image-level matching rather than text-based character matching, which makes it more accurate and fair. CDM also takes into account the spatial position of characters, making it more comprehensive than previous metrics....
