summary: GIMDiffusion is a new Text-to-3D model that uses 2D images to represent 3D shapes, making it faster and more efficient than other models. It can generate high-quality 3D objects from text descriptions by using the rich 2D priors of existing Text-to-Image models. This allows for strong generalization even with limited 3D training data and retains compatibility with guidance techniques such as IPAdapter. The generated objects have semantically meaningful, separate parts and include internal struct...
