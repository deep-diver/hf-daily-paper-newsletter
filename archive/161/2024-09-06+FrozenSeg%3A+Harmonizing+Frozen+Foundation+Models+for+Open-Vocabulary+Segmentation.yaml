summary: FrozenSeg is a method that combines spatial knowledge from a localization foundation model and semantic knowledge from a vision-language model to improve object segmentation and recognition in unseen categories and scenarios. It freezes both foundation models and optimizes only a lightweight transformer decoder for mask proposal generation, resulting in improved performance across various segmentation benchmarks....
