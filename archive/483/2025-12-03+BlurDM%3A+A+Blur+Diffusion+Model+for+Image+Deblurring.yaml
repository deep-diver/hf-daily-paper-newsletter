link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.03979
summary: The study presents a Blur Diffusion Model (BlurDM) that improves image deblurring by incorporating the blur formation process into diffusion models. BlurDM simultaneously denoises and deblurs images, outperforming existing methods on benchmark datasets by efficiently integrating into deblurring networks in the latent space....
