summary: This study presents a new method called Double Interactive Reinforcement Learning (DIRL) that helps Vision Language Models (VLMs) use multiple tools together for better spatial understanding. DIRL allows VLMs to discover optimal tool-use patterns without relying on predefined strategies, and the resulting model, SpaceTools, outperforms existing methods in spatial reasoning benchmarks and real-world manipulation tasks using a robotic arm....
