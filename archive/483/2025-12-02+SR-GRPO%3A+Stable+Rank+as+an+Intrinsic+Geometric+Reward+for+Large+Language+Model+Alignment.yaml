summary: The abstract presents a new method called stable rank, which is an internal, annotation-free quality signal derived from Large Language Models' representations. This signal measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states and is used in a reinforcement learning technique called SR-GRPO, which improves model performance on various tasks without relying on external supervision....
