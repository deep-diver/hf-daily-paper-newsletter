summary: AdaptVision is a new approach for Vision-Language Models that reduces computation by adaptively acquiring only necessary visual tokens. It uses a coarse-to-fine method, starting with low-resolution images and cropping key regions when needed, and is trained using a reinforcement learning framework that balances accuracy and efficiency, resulting in better performance and fewer visual tokens compared to existing methods....
