summary: The authors propose a new alignment strategy for Normalizing Flows that improves generative quality by aligning intermediate features of the reverse pass with a powerful vision model. They also introduce a new test-time optimization algorithm for classification, resulting in faster training, better accuracy, and new state-of-the-art results on ImageNet....
