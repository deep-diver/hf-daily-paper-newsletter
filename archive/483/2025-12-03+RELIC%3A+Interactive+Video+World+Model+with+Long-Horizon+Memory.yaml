summary: The RELIC framework is introduced to create an interactive world model that combines real-time long-horizon streaming, consistent spatial memory, and precise user control. This model uses compressed historical latent tokens and a memory-efficient self-forcing paradigm to enable long-duration exploration of arbitrary scenes in real time, outperforming previous work in terms of accuracy, stability, and robustness....
