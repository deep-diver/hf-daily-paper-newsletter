summary: This paper proposes a framework called GALA3D that uses language models to
  generate the initial layout and then generates 3D content using a layout-guided
  3D Gaussian representation. The framework also includes an object-scene compositional
  optimization mechanism to generate realistic 3D scenes with consistent geometry,
  texture, scale, and accurate interactions among multiple objects....
