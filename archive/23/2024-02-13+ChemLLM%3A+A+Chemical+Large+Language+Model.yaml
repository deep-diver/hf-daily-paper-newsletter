summary: The paper proposes a new large language model called ChemLLM, specifically designed for chemistry applications. It utilizes a template-based instruction construction method to transform structured knowledge into natural language, making it suitable for dialogue-based tasks. ChemLLM outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on various chemistry-related tasks and also demonstrates adaptability to related mathematical and physical tasks....
