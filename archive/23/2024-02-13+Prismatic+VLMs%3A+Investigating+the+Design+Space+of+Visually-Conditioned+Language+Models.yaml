summary: The paper investigates the design of visually-conditioned language models
  by compiling a suite of standardized evaluations and exploring key design axes.
  They develop a unified framework for VLM evaluation, optimized code for training,
  and resource contributions of checkpoints and models that outperform the current
  state-of-the-art VLM models....
