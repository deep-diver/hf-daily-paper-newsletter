summary: This paper explores the impact of multi-time bootstrapping self-alignment on large language models and proposes Step-On-Feet Tuning (SOFT) to boost zero or one-shot performance by leveraging the model's continuously enhanced few-shot ability. Further, they propose SOFT+ with an easy-to-hard training recipe that furthers enhances performance. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods across various tasks, highlighting the potential for enhancing model alignment performance th...
