summary: This paper proposes OS-Copilot, a framework that aims to build generalist
  computer agents capable of interacting with various elements in an operating system,
  including websites, code terminals, files, multimedia, and third-party applications.
  It also introduces FRIDAY, a self-improving agent built using OS-Copilot, which
  excels in automating general computer tasks and showcases strong generalization
  to unseen applications....
