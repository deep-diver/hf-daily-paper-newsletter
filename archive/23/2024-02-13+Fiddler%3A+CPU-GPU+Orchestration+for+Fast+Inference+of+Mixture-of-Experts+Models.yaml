summary: Fiddler is a resource-efficient inference engine that uses CPU-GPU orchestration to improve performance and efficiency of Mixture-of-Experts models, allowing for faster inference on resource-constrained settings, such as single GPU with limited memory resources. It significantly improves performance compared to existing methods....
