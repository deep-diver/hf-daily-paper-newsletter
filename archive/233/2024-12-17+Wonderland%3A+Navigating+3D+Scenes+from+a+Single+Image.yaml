summary: This paper introduces a new method to create high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes from a single image by using a large-scale reconstruction model and a video diffusion model. The model can generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency, and it can generate high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes efficiently....
