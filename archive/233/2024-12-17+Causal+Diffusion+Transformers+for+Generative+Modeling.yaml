summary: This paper introduces Causal Diffusion, an autoregressive (AR) counterpart of diffusion models that can handle both discrete and continuous data. The paper proposes CausalFusion, a decoder-only transformer that dual-factorizes data across sequential tokens and diffusion noise levels, leading to state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet generation benchmark. CausalFusion also has the advantage of generating an arbitrary number of tokens for in-context reasoning and can do zero-shot in-context imag...
