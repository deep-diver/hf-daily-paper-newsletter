summary: This paper presents IDArb, a diffusion-based model that accurately and consistently estimates surface normals and material properties from multiple images with varying illuminations. It uses a novel attention module and training strategy, and is trained on the new ARB-Objaverse dataset. IDArb outperforms existing methods and can be used for tasks like single-image relighting, photometric stereo, and 3D reconstruction....
