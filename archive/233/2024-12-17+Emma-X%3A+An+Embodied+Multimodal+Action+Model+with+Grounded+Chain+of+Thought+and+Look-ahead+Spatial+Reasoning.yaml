summary: The paper introduces Emma-X, a model that helps robots better understand and perform tasks by using a combination of vision, language, and action. It does this by creating a hierarchy of tasks and using a dataset of 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories. Emma-X also uses a strategy to divide tasks into smaller parts to avoid mistakes. The paper shows that Emma-X performs better than other models in real-world tasks that require spatial reasoning....
