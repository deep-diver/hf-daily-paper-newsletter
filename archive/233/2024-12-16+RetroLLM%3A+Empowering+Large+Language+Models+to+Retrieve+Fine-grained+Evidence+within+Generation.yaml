summary: RetroLLM is a unified framework that combines retrieval and generation processes to help large language models generate fine-grained evidence from a corpus with constrained decoding, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy. This framework uses hierarchical FM-Index constraints and a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy to mitigate false pruning and improve performance on five open-domain QA datasets....
