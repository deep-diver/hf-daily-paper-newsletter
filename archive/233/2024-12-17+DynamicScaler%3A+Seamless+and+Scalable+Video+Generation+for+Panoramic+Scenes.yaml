summary: This paper presents a method called DynamicScaler that generates high-quality panoramic videos for AR/VR applications. It uses a diffusion model to create dynamic scenes of any size, with a special focus on maintaining coherence and consistency across the entire panoramic space. The method is efficient, scalable, and doesn't require any additional training. It also has a constant memory usage regardless of the output video resolution. The project website is dynamic-scaler.pages.dev....
