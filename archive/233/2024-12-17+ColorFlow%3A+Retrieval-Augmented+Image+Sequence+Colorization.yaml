summary: The paper proposes a new method called ColorFlow for colorizing black-and-white image sequences in industrial applications. It uses a three-stage diffusion-based framework and a retrieval augmented colorization pipeline to improve color identity extraction and colorization. The method outperforms existing models and could benefit the art industry....
