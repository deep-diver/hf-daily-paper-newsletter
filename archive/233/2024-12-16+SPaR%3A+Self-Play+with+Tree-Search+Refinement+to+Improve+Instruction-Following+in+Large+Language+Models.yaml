summary: This paper introduces SPaR, a method that improves instruction-following in large language models by reducing irrelevant variations in preference pairs. SPaR uses self-play and tree-search refinement to create valid and comparable preference pairs. The method is scalable and transferable, enhancing models like GLM-4-9B and LLaMA3-70B, and it surpasses GPT-4-Turbo on the IFEval benchmark without losing general capabilities....
