summary: This paper presents a novel diffusion-based framework for video face swapping, addressing the limitations of existing methods by incorporating an image-video hybrid training framework and a specially designed diffusion model. The framework also includes the Attribute-Identity Disentanglement Triplet Dataset and 3D reconstruction techniques for handling pose variations. The results show improved identity preservation, temporal consistency, and visual quality compared to existing methods, while re...
