summary: The paper proposes a new model architecture called Wonderful Matrices that combines sequence transformation and state transformation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models. The architecture includes rotary position embedding, dynamic mask attention, and cross domain mixture of experts, which reduce perplexity, improve accuracy, and speed up expert retrieval, respectively. These matrix algorithms can be used as a competitor to existing model architectures....
