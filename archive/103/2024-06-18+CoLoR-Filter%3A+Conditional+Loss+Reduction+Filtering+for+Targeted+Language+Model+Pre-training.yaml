summary: The paper introduces CoLoR-Filter, a method for selecting high-quality data for pre-training language models. It uses auxiliary models to identify an optimal subset of data based on their relative loss values. CoLoR-Filter is empirically evaluated on two language modeling tasks and shows favorable scaling results. Code and filtered data are available....
