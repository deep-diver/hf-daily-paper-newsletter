summary: This paper examines the ability of neural networks to fit data in practice. It finds that standard optimizers find minima where the model can only fit training sets with significantly fewer samples than it has parameters, and that convolutional networks are more parameter-efficient than MLPs and ViTs. The difference in capacity to fit correctly labeled and incorrectly labeled samples can be predictive of generalization, and ReLU activation functions result in finding minima that fit more data....
