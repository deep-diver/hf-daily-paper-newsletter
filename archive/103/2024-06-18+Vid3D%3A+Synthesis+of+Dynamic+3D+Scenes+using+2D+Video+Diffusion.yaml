summary: This paper proposes a model named Vid3D that generates dynamic 3D scenes by leveraging 2D video diffusion. The model does not explicitly model 3D temporal dynamics, which is a common approach in current methods. Vid3D is evaluated against two state-of-the-art 3D video generation methods and achieves comparable results. The paper also explores how the number of views generated per frame affects the quality of Vid3D, finding minor performance degradation with fewer views. The results suggest that ...
