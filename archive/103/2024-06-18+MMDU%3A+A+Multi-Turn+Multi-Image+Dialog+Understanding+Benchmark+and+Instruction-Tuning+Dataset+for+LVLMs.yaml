summary: The paper introduces MMDU, a benchmark and instruction tuning dataset for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), to evaluate and improve their abilities in multi-turn and multi-image conversations. The dataset is constructed by clustering relevant images and textual descriptions from Wikipedia and generating question-answer pairs by human annotators with the assistance of GPT-4. The paper also demonstrates that fine-tuning open-source LVLMs on MMDU-45k significantly improves their performance on ...
