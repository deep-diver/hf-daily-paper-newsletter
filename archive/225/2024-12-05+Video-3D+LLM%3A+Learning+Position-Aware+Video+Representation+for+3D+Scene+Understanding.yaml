summary: The paper introduces a new model called Video-3D LLM that improves 3D scene understanding by treating 3D scenes as videos and adding 3D position information to the model's representations. The model also uses a technique called maximum coverage sampling to balance computational costs and performance. The authors show that their model outperforms other models on several 3D scene understanding tasks....
