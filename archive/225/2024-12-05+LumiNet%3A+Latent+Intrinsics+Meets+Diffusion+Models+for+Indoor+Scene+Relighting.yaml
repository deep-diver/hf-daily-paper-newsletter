summary: LumiNet is a new method that uses generative models and hidden properties of light to change the lighting in a scene. It uses a StyleGAN-based model to create a new image that has the lighting of a target image but keeps the shape and color of the original image. This is done by processing hidden properties from both images and using a learned adaptor to transfer the lighting. LumiNet is better than other methods at transferring complex lighting effects like specular highlights and indirect illu...
