summary: Mimir is a new framework for generating videos from text descriptions that improves the precision of text understanding by combining the strengths of video diffusion models and large language models. It does this by using a special token fuser to blend the features from both types of models, allowing the video generation model to benefit from the learned video priors and the text-related capabilities of the language model. This results in higher quality videos with better text comprehension, esp...
