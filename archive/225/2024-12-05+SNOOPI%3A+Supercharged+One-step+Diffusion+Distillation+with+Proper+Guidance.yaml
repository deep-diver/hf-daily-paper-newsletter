summary: This paper introduces SNOOPI, a new framework that improves training stability and adds support for negative prompt guidance in one-step diffusion models. It uses a random-scale classifier-free guidance approach and a training-free method called Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA). SNOOPI significantly improves baseline models across various metrics and sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark for one-step diffusion models with an HPSv2 score of 31.08....
