summary: The paper investigates the impact of quality, diversity, and complexity in synthetic data generated by Large Language Models. It finds that quality is crucial for in-distribution generalization, diversity is essential for out-of-distribution generalization, and complexity is beneficial for both. The paper also highlights the trade-offs between these characteristics and their influence on model performance. Additionally, it discusses the importance of balancing these trade-offs for efficient rein...
