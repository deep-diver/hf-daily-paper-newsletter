summary: The authors present a new framework called Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy (H^3DP) for visuomotor learning in robotic manipulation. This framework has three levels of hierarchy that improve the integration between visual perception and action prediction, resulting in better performance compared to baseline methods in both simulation and real-world tasks....
