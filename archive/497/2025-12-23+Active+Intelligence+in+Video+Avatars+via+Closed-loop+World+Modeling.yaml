summary: This study presents a new framework called ORCA that allows video avatars to interact with their environment proactively and achieve long-term goals. ORCA uses a closed-loop cycle to maintain state tracking and a dual-system architecture for strategic reasoning and action execution, enabling autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios, as demonstrated by extensive experiments....
