summary: The study explores the internal mechanisms of large language models by decomposing their policies into layers and modules, revealing insights about how they reason and make predictions. The researchers propose a new optimization method, Bottom-up Policy Optimization, which improves model performance by directly optimizing the internal layer policy during early training, resulting in superior performance on complex reasoning benchmarks....
