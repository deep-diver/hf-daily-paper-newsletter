summary: This paper proposes a new task called Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF), which involves generating standardized garment images from single photos of clothed individuals. The paper introduces TryOffDiff, a model that uses Stable Diffusion and SigLIP-based visual conditioning to ensure high fidelity and detail retention in the generated images. The model outperforms baseline methods and highlights the potential of VTOFF for enhancing product imagery in e-commerce applications and advancing generative model ...
