summary: This paper introduces a new dataset called Img-Diff, which helps large language models better understand images by focusing on the differences between similar images. The researchers used advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that highlight object replacements. They then fine-tuned existing models using this dataset and achieved better results than other models trained on larger datasets. They also explored other ways to generate image difference data and released t...
