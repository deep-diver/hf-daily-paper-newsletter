summary: This paper introduces a new task called Task-oriented Sequential Grounding in 3D scenes, where an agent needs to locate a series of target objects in indoor scenes to complete daily tasks by following detailed instructions. The paper also presents a large-scale dataset called SG3D for this task, which contains 22,346 tasks with 112,236 steps across 4,895 real-world 3D scenes. The paper adapts three state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding models to the sequential grounding task and evaluates their p...
