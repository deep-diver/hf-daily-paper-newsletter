summary: A new method, instruction back-and-forth translation, is proposed to create high-quality synthetic data for aligning large language models. This method involves generating and curating synthetic instructions using backtranslation and rewriting responses to improve their quality. Fine-tuning with the resulting pairs yields better performance than using other common instruction datasets, and the method outperforms direct distillation. The generated instructions are of higher quality and the respon...
