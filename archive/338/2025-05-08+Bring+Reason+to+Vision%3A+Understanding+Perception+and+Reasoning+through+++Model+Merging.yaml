summary: This study explores combining visual perception and reasoning abilities in models by connecting parameters of different models, specifically merging Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models. Through experiments, the researchers find that merging allows reasoning capabilities to be transferred from Language Models to Vision-Language Models and reveals that perception is mainly in early layers while reasoning is in middle-to-late layers, with merging enabling all layers to contribute to re...
