summary: This paper introduces DPA-RAG, a framework that helps large language models (LLMs) in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) better align their diverse knowledge preferences, making RAG systems more reliable. It uses a preference knowledge construction pipeline and five query augmentation strategies to address preference data scarcity. DPA-RAG also introduces a pre-aligned stage before Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to help LLMs capture knowledge aligned with their reasoning preferences. Experimenta...
