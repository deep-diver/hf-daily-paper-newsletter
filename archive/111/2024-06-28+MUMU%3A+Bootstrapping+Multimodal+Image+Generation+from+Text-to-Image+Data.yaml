summary: We train a model to generate images from text and image prompts. We use this model to create a multimodal dataset by extracting semantically meaningful image crops from captions. Our model, MUMU, is composed of a vision-language model encoder with a diffusion decoder and is trained on a single GPU node. MUMU learns to compose inputs from different images into a coherent output and generalizes to tasks like style transfer and character consistency. This shows the potential of using multimodal mod...
