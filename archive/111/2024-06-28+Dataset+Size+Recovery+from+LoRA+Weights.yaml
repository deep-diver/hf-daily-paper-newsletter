summary: The paper proposes a method called DSiRe to predict the number of images used to fine-tune a model using LoRA weights, and introduces a new benchmark called LoRA-WiSE to evaluate this method. The best classifier can predict the number of fine-tuning images with a mean absolute error of 0.36 images, showing that this attack is feasible....
