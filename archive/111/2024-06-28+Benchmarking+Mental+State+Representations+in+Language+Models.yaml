summary: This paper studies how different model sizes, fine-tuning approaches, and prompt designs affect mental state representations in language models. It also investigates how prompt variations impact probing performance on theory of mind tasks and demonstrates that it's possible to improve models' reasoning performance by steering their activations without training any probe....
