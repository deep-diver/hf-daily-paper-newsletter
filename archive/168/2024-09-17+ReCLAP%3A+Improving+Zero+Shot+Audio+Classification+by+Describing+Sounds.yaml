summary: This paper introduces a new method to improve zero-shot audio classification by using audio-language models that describe sounds using their inherent features instead of abstract category labels. The method involves training a model called ReCLAP with rewritten audio captions and using custom prompts for each unique label in the dataset. The method improves ReCLAP's performance on zero-shot audio classification by 1%-18% and outperforms all baselines by 1% - 55%....
