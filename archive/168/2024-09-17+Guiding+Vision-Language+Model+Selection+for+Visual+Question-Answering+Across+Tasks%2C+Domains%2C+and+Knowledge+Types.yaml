summary: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in practical settings, particularly for Visual Question-Answering (VQA) tasks. It introduces a novel dataset and a multimodal evaluation metric called GoEval, and experiments with ten state-of-the-art VLMs to guide the selection of VLMs based on specific task requirements and resource constraints. Proprietary models like Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini generally outperform others, while open-source models l...
