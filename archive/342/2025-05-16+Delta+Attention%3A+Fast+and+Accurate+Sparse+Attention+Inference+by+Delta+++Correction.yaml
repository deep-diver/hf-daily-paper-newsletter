summary: The paper presents a new method to improve sparse attention inference, which reduces computational costs but often leads to decreased performance. The proposed method corrects a distributional shift in sparse attention outputs, enhancing alignment between queries and keys, and resulting in a significant performance boost and faster processing compared to existing methods....
