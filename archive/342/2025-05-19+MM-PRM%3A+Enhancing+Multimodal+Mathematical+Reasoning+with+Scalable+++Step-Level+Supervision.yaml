summary: The authors present MM-PRM, a process reward model designed to improve multimodal mathematical reasoning by introducing a scalable, automated framework for fine-grained supervision of intermediate reasoning steps. This model significantly enhances the logical robustness of multimodal reasoning systems by scoring candidate reasoning paths and outperforming existing benchmarks without requiring human labeling....
