summary: The study presents a new method, SEED-GRPO, which measures the uncertainty of large language models by calculating the diversity of meaning in their generated answers. This uncertainty measurement is used to adjust the magnitude of policy updates, allowing for more careful updates on questions the model is unsure about and maintaining confidence in its answers. The method is tested and proven effective on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks....
