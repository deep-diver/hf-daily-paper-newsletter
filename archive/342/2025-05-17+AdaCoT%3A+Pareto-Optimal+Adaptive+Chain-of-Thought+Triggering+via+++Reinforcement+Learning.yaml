summary: The authors propose AdaCoT, a new method for Large Language Models to decide when to use Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which helps with complex tasks but can be inefficient. AdaCoT uses Reinforcement Learning to balance model performance with the costs of using Chain-of-Thought, resulting in significant reductions in its usage for simpler tasks without sacrificing performance on complex ones....
