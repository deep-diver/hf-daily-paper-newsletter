summary: The authors present a new method called hybrid 3D-4D Gaussian Splatting that efficiently represents both static and dynamic regions in 3D scenes. This technique reduces computational overhead and memory usage by converting static parts into 3D Gaussians while preserving high-fidelity 4D Gaussians for moving objects, resulting in faster training times without compromising image quality....
