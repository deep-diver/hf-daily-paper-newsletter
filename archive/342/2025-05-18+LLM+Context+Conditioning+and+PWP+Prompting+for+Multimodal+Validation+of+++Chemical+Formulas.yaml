summary: This study looks into improving the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) like Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT Plus o3 for validating complex scientific documents by using a method called Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP) to condition the LLMs' analytical mindset. The results show that this approach can help LLMs better identify textual and image-based errors in scientific documents, particularly with Gemini 2.5 Pro successfully spotting a subtle image-based formula error that was missed during ...
