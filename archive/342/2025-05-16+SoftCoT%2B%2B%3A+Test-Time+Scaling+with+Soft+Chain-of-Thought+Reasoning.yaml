summary: The study presents SoftCoT++, a method that improves reasoning performance during inference by exploring diverse thinking paths in the continuous latent space, overcoming the limitation of fixed latent representations in SoftCoT. Experiments show that SoftCoT++ significantly enhances SoftCoT and outperforms it with self-consistency scaling, demonstrating strong compatibility with conventional scaling techniques....
