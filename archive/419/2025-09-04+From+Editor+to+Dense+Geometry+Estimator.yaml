summary: This study compares fine-tuning image editing models and text-to-image generative models for dense geometry estimation, finding that editing models perform better due to their structural priors. The research then introduces FE2E, a framework that uses an advanced editing model to estimate dense geometry, resulting in significant performance improvements without additional training data....
