summary: This study presents a new generative model called Transition Models (TiM) that overcomes the trade-off between computational cost and output quality in generative modeling. TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 865M parameters, outperforming larger models like SD3.5 and FLUX.1, and improves quality with more generation steps, unlike previous few-step generators....
