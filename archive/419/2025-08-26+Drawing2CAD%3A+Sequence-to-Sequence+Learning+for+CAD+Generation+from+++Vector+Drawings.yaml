summary: The study presents a new approach to convert 2D vector drawings into parametric CAD models, which is essential in engineering design but has been overlooked. They propose a framework called Drawing2CAD, which uses a sequence-to-sequence learning problem to maintain geometric precision and design intent, and introduce a new dataset, CAD-VGDrawing, to train and evaluate their method....
