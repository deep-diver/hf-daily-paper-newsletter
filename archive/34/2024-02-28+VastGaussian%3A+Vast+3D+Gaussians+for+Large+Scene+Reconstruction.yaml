summary: This paper presents VastGaussian, a method for high-quality reconstruction
  and real-time rendering of large scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting. It addresses
  limitations of existing methods by dividing large scenes into multiple cells and
  using a progressive partitioning strategy for parallel optimization. It also introduces
  decoupled appearance modeling to reduce appearance variations in the rendered images,
  achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets with fast optimization and
  high-...
