summary: The paper introduces DiffuseKronA, a new method for fine-tuning diffusion
  models in text-to-image generation, which reduces the number of parameters by 35%
  and 99.947% compared to LoRA-DreamBooth and the original DreamBooth, respectively.
  It also improves image quality and reduces sensitivity to hyperparameters, making
  it easier to use and more efficient....
