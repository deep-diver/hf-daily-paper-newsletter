summary: The paper presents a new method called DiffusionPDE that uses generative diffusion models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) when there is incomplete information about the scene. It learns the joint distribution of the solution and coefficient spaces to fill in missing information and solve PDEs accurately, outperforming existing methods for both forward and inverse directions....
