summary: This study proposes a tuning-free framework called FreeTraj to achieve trajectory-controllable video generation by imposing guidance on noise construction and attention computation. It analyzes how initial noises influence motion trajectory and modifies noise sampling and attention mechanisms to enhance trajectory controllability. FreeTraj can be used with manually provided or automatically generated trajectories....
