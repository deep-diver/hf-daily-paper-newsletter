summary: The paper proposes a method called Image Conductor to control camera transitions and object movements in video asset generation from a single image. It uses a training strategy to separate camera and object motion, and a camera-free guidance technique during inference to enhance object movements. The method is demonstrated to be precise and controllable in generating videos from images....
