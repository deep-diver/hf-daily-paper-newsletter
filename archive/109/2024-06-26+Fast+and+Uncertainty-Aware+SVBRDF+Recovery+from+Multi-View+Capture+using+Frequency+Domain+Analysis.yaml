summary: This paper proposes a new method for fast and accurate reconstruction of an object's appearance properties, even under uncontrolled lighting and unstructured viewpoints. It leverages frequency domain analysis and deconvolution to estimate material properties in seconds, and quantifies the uncertainty of the estimation based on available data. The approach is compared to previous work and shown to provide similar quality results in a fraction of the time, while also providing key information abou...
