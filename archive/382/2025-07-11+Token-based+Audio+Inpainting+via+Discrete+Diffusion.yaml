summary: The authors present a new method for fixing corrupted audio, particularly effective for long gaps (up to 500 ms), by using a discrete diffusion model on tokenized audio representations. This approach ensures stable and meaningful reconstruction of missing audio segments, outperforming existing models, especially for longer gaps, and can be heard in examples provided in the link....
