summary: The study presents MISS-QA, a new evaluation benchmark for testing how well multimodal foundation models can understand schematic diagrams in scientific papers. The benchmark has 1,500 examples from 465 papers, and the researchers found that current models struggle compared to human experts, especially with complex questions, providing insights for future improvements....
