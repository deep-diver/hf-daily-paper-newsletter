summary: The authors present a cost-effective method to build powerful image captioning models by using pre-trained components and reducing the need for large, paired image-text datasets. Their approach, called VLV auto-encoder, effectively distills knowledge from a text-conditioned diffusion model and leverages a pre-trained language model to generate high-quality captions, all while keeping training expenses under $1,000....
