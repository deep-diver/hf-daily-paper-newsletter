summary: 'The paper presents a novel inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models, introducing three key ideas: SDE-based generation, interpolant conversion, and rollover budget forcing. SDE-based generation enables particle sampling in flow models, while interpolant conversion expands the search space and boosts sample diversity. The adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps, through rollover budget forcing, maximizes budget utilization. Experiments confirm that the pr...'
