summary: This research presents a simple yet effective method for tracking multiple UAVs in thermal infrared video, using YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT with tailored training and inference strategies. The approach outperforms previous methods without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, and the code is available online....
