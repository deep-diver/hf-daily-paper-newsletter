summary: This research focuses on the issue of incorrect responses from large multimodal models (LMMs) in handling dynamic video data, which is more challenging than static data like images and text. The study introduces a benchmark named HAVEN for evaluating LMMs' performance in video understanding tasks, identifying 7 factors impacting hallucinations, and proposing a video-thinking model using supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO) to improve accuracy and redu...
