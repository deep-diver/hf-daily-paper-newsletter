summary: This study evaluates VLMs on human-centered decision-making tasks and discovers that text-only trained LLMs outperform VLMs that process images. The authors propose a text-only training approach using synthesized text data, enhancing VLMs' language components and improving multimodal inference, without the need for image-text pair data. VLMs can also self-improve using training data generated by their LLM counterparts, making the process more efficient and scalable....
