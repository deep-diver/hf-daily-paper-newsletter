summary: This paper presents AfriHate, a collection of hate speech and abusive language datasets in 15 African languages, annotated by native speakers familiar with the local culture. The datasets aim to address the lack of high-quality data in local languages and the failure to include local communities in the collection, annotation, and moderation processes. The datasets, individual annotations, and hate speech and offensive language lexicons are available on https://github.com/AfriHate/AfriHate...
