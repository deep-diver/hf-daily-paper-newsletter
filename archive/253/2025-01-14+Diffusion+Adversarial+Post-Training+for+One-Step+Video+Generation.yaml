summary: This paper proposes a method called Adversarial Post-Training (APT) for generating high-quality videos and images in real time using a single forward evaluation step. The method improves the training stability and quality by introducing several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. The proposed method, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step and...
