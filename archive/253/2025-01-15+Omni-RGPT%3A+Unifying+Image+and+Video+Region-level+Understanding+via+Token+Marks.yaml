summary: We propose a new multimodal language model called Omni-RGPT that helps computers understand images and videos on a region-level. We introduce a new concept called Token Mark, which highlights important regions within a visual feature space. Token Mark is embedded into the spatial regions using region prompts and simultaneously incorporated into the text prompt to establish a direct connection between visual and text tokens. Omni-RGPT outperforms existing models on image and video-based commonsen...
