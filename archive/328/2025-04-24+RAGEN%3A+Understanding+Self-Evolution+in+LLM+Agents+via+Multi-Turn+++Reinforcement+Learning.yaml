summary: The study proposes StarPO, a framework for training LLM agents in interactive environments, and introduces RAGEN, a system for evaluating these agents. The research identifies challenges in agent RL training, such as Echo Trap, and offers solutions, while also highlighting the importance of diverse initial states, medium interaction granularity, and fine-grained reward signals for effective agent reasoning....
