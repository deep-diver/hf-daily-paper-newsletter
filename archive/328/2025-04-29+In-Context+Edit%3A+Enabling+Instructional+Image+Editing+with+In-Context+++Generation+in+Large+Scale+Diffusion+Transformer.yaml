summary: 'This study presents a new method for instruction-based image editing that improves precision and efficiency. It utilizes a large-scale Diffusion Transformer''s generation capacity and contextual awareness, introducing three contributions: an in-context editing framework, a tuning strategy, and an inference-time scaling method, all of which outperform existing techniques with fewer resources....'
