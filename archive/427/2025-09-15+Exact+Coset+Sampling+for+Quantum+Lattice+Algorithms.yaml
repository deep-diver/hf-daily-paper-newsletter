summary: The authors propose a new method to fix a problem in a quantum lattice algorithm, specifically in Step 9, which has a mismatch issue. Their solution involves a pair-shift difference construction that cancels unknown offsets, creates an exact uniform state, and enforces the intended relation, all while preserving the algorithm's efficiency....
