summary: This study introduces a new framework called Stable Part Diffusion 4D that generates both colored images and structural component videos from a single input. It uses a unique encoding method to simplify the model and allows for flexible part counts, while also ensuring consistency between the generated components. The framework is trained and tested on a large dataset of rigged objects and demonstrates strong generalization to various scenarios, making it useful for animation and motion-related ...
