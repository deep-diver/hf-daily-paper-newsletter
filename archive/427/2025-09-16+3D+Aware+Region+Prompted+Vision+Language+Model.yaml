summary: The authors describe a new model that links 2D images and 3D data by using a shared visual token space, enabling flexible region prompting without exhaustive labeling. This model enhances 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, allowing for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames and achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, even in real-world videos without 3D inputs or annotations....
