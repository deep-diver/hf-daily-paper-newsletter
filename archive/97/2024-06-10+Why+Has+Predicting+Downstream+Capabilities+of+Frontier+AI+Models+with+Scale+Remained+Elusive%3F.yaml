summary: Predicting downstream capabilities of advanced AI models with scale is challenging due to a sequence of transformations that degrade the statistical relationship between performance and scale. This makes it difficult to accurately predict downstream capabilities, especially when comparing the correct choice against specific incorrect choices. However, our study suggests that scaling laws for incorrect choices might be achievable, which could help establish more predictable evaluations of frontie...
