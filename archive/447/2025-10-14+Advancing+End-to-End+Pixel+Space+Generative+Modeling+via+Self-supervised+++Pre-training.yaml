summary: This study presents a new two-stage training method that improves the performance and efficiency of pixel-space diffusion and consistency models, which typically lag behind latent-space models. The proposed framework pre-trains encoders to learn semantics from images and then fine-tunes a decoder, resulting in a diffusion model that outperforms previous pixel-space methods and rivals VAE-based models on the ImageNet dataset....
