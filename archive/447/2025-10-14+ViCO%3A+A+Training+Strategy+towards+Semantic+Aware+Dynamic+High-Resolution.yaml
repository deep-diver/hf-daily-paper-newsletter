summary: The authors present a new training algorithm, Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), which allows models to use varying numbers of vision tokens for images with different semantic complexities. By employing multiple MLP connectors and a visual resolution router, the method reduces the number of vision tokens by up to 50% during inference without compromising the model's performance, leading to more efficient Multimodal Large Language Models....
