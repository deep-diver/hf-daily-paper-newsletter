summary: This study proposes a new way to understand how large language models reason by analyzing their internal representation space as flows, or embedding trajectories. The researchers disentangle logic from meaning and connect reasoning to geometric quantities like position and velocity, providing a new perspective for interpreting and analyzing the behavior of large language models....
