summary: The paper addresses the issue of data contamination in the reinforcement learning post-training phase of large language models, which can compromise their performance evaluation. The authors introduce Self-Critique, a method that detects data contamination by identifying policy collapse, and RL-MIA, a benchmark for simulating this scenario. Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods in detecting contamination, achieving up to a 30% improvement in AUC....
