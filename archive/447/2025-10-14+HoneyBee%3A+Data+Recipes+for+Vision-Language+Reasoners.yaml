summary: This study investigates how to build effective datasets for training vision-language models (VLMs) in reasoning tasks, identifying key factors like context source, data interventions, and scaling up data. The researchers created HoneyBee, a large-scale reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples, which significantly improves VLM performance, and introduced a test-time scaling strategy to reduce decoding cost....
