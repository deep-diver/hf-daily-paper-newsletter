summary: The study evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as world models for computer-use agents and identifies their limitations in long-horizon simulations due to hallucination and static training knowledge. To overcome these challenges, the researchers propose R-WoM, a retrieval-augmented world model that incorporates real-time, factual knowledge from external sources, resulting in significant performance improvements in simulations....
