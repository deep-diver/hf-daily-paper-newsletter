summary: The authors of this study found that existing noise-reducing models often have a problem where the expected noise level doesn't match the actual noise level during the sampling process, which they call 'noise shift'. To fix this, they created a new method called Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) that helps keep the noise levels consistent. They also made a simpler version of NAG that doesn't need extra tools, and their tests showed that NAG significantly improved the quality of the generated images...
