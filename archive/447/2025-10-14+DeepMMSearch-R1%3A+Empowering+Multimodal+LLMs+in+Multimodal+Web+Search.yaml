summary: The authors present DeepMMSearch-R1, a multimodal LLM that can perform on-demand, multi-turn web searches and adaptively craft queries for both image and text search tools. It uses a two-stage training pipeline and a novel multimodal VQA dataset called DeepMMSearchVQA, which teaches the model when and how to search for information. The approach outperforms existing methods in various knowledge-intensive benchmarks....
