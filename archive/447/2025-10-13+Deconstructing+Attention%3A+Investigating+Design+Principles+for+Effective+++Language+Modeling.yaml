summary: This study examines the key components of the dot-product attention mechanism in Transformer language models and tests their necessity. The researchers created modified versions of attention, some with relaxed principles, and found that while token mixing is crucial, other components can be simplified or relaxed, especially when combined with standard attention, leading to more efficient language models....
