summary: The paper presents a solution to improve the generation quality of diffusion models by reducing errors that accumulate during the generation process. The proposed method, Temporal Alignment Guidance, uses a time predictor to identify and correct deviations from the desired data manifold at each step, resulting in better sample fidelity and performance on various tasks....
