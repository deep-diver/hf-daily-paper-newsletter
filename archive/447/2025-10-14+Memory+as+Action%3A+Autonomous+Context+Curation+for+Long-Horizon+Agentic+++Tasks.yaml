summary: This study presents a new approach called Memory-as-Action, where agents manage their working memory by executing editing operations as part of a unified policy. The proposed method, Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, enables stable end-to-end reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points, leading to improved task performance and reduced computational consumption through adaptive context curation strategies....
