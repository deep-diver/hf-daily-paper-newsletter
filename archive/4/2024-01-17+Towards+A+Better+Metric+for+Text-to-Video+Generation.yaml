summary: 'This paper proposes a novel evaluation metric, the Text-to-Video Score (T2VScore), for assessing the quality of text-to-video generation models. The T2VScore considers two criteria: Text-Video Alignment and Video Quality, and is evaluated on the TVGE dataset. The study showcases the limitations of existing metrics and the drawbacks of user studies. The proposed T2VScore outperforms existing metrics and provides a better indicator of text-to-video generation quality....'
