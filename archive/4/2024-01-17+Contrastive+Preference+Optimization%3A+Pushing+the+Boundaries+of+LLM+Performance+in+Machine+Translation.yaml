summary: This paper proposes a novel approach called Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to address the performance gap between moderate-sized large language models (LLMs) and state-of-the-art translation models in machine translation. CPO trains models to avoid generating adequate but not perfect translations, and the resulting model, ALMA-R, significantly improves upon the performance of other models on different test datasets. By contrast, traditional supervised fine-tuning approaches for LLMs d...
