summary: This paper proposes a clustering-based approach for automatically curating high-quality datasets for self-supervised pre-training, which are large, diverse, and balanced. The method involves successive and hierarchical applications of k-means on a large and diverse data repository to obtain clusters that distribute uniformly among data concepts, followed by a hierarchical, balanced sampling step from these clusters. Experiments on three different data domains show that features trained on automa...
