summary: The paper introduces a new framework called HDR-GS that efficiently generates high dynamic range novel views and reconstructs low dynamic range images with a user input exposure time. The framework uses a Dual Dynamic Range Gaussian point cloud model and two Parallel Differentiable Rasterization processes to achieve this. HDR-GS outperforms existing NeRF-based methods in terms of image quality and speed....
