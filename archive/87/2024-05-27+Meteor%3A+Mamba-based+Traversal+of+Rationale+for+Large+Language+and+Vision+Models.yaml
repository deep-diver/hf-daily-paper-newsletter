summary: Meteor is a new efficient large language and vision model that uses multifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. It uses the Mamba architecture to embed lengthy rationales and a backbone multimodal language model to generate answers. Meteor achieves significant improvements in vision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks without scaling up the model size or using additional vision encoders and computer vision models....
