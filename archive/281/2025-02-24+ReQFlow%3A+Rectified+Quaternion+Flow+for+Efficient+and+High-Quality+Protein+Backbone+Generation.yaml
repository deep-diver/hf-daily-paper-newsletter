summary: The proposed ReQFlow method generates protein backbones efficiently and with high quality by creating local translations and 3D rotations from random noise for each residue in a protein chain, utilizing unit quaternions and spherical linear interpolation for 3D rotation representation and flow construction. Experiments show ReQFlow outperforms existing methods in protein backbone generation, requiring fewer sampling steps and significantly less inference time, making it an effective and efficien...
