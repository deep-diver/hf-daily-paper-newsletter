summary: CrossOver is a framework for cross-modal 3D scene understanding that aligns modalities - RGB images, point clouds, CAD models, floorplans, and text descriptions - with relaxed constraints to create a unified, modality-agnostic embedding space for scenes. It supports robust scene retrieval and object localization, even with missing modalities, and performs better than traditional methods in evaluations on ScanNet and 3RScan datasets....
