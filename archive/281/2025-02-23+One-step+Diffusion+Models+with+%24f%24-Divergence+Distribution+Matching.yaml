summary: This study introduces a method called f-distill, which improves the generation speed of diffusion models by matching their distributions using an f-divergence minimization framework. Empirically, it is shown that alternative f-divergences, such as forward-KL and Jensen-Shannon divergences, outperform existing methods in image generation tasks....
