summary: The study examines how Large Language Models (LLMs) store contextual information, discovering that seemingly minor tokens (such as determiners and punctuation) play a significant role in maintaining context. The researchers also explore the relationship between contextualization and linearity, and present LLM-Microscope, a toolkit to assess token-level nonlinearity, contextual memory, and other factors that contribute to long-range understanding....
