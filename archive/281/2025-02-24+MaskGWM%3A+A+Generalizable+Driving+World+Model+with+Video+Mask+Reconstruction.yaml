summary: 'The paper presents MaskGWM, a driving world model that improves generalization by combining generation loss with MAE-style feature-level context learning. It introduces a more scalable Diffusion Transformer structure, diffusion-related mask tokens, and extends mask construction to the spatial-temporal domain, resulting in two variants: MaskGWM-long for long-horizon prediction and MaskGWM-mview for multi-view generation....'
