summary: The authors propose a new tuning-free IPT2V framework called FantasyID, which enhances the face knowledge of a pre-trained video model. It uses 3D facial geometry prior for plausible facial structures, multi-view face augmentation for diverse facial appearance features, and a learnable layer-aware adaptive mechanism to selectively inject fused features into DiT layers....
