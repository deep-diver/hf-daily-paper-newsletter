summary: The paper presents UPCORE, a method-agnostic framework for selecting data points to minimize damage to a pretrained model during the removal of specific information, striking a balance between deletion efficacy and model preservation. UPCORE prunes outliers in the forget set, correlating with model representation variance, and consistently achieves a superior balance across three standard unlearning methods, improving both standard metrics and AUC....
