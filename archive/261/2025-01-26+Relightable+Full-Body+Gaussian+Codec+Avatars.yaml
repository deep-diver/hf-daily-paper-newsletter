summary: The authors present a novel method to model full-body avatars with detailed features, focusing on handling large deformations due to body articulation and the impact of light transport. They address these issues by dividing light transport into local and non-local effects, using learnable zonal harmonics for local diffuse radiance transfer and a shadow network for non-local shadowing....
