summary: Researchers have developed a transformer model trained with reinforcement learning that can learn to solve new problems it has not encountered before, a concept called In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL). ICRL can solve unseen environments in-distribution with high sample efficiency, perform well in out-of-distribution environments, and adapt to non-stationary environments....
