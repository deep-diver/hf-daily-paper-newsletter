summary: The paper presents a new benchmark for evaluating the critique capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a closed-loop methodology, which includes features like self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique. The benchmark is implemented using eight challenging reasoning tasks, and the results show that advanced reasoning-based models outperform classical LLMs across all critique scenarios....
