summary: 'The authors propose a new method called ReVSeg for video object segmentation that uses pretrained vision language models to break down the task into three explicit operations: semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding. They then use reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and interpretable reasoning trajectories....'
