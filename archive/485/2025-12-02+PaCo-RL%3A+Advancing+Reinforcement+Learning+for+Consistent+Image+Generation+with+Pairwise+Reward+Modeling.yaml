summary: The researchers present a new framework, PaCo-RL, for generating consistent images using reinforcement learning. This framework includes a pairwise consistency evaluator, PaCo-Reward, and an efficient RL algorithm, PaCo-GRPO, which together improve alignment with human perceptions and achieve state-of-the-art performance in consistent image generation....
