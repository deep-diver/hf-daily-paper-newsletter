summary: The study presents a new benchmark, TAD, specifically designed to evaluate the temporal understanding of autonomous driving using vision-language models. The benchmark consists of over 6,000 questions and answers, focusing on the unique challenges of ego-centric autonomous driving footage. The researchers found that current state-of-the-art models struggle with this task due to imperfect motion understanding and propose two novel training-free solutions, Scene-CoT and TCogMap, to improve perform...
