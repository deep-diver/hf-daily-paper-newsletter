summary: The authors present SCAIL, a new framework for creating high-quality character animations that can handle complex motions and different characters seamlessly. They achieve this by introducing a new 3D pose representation and a full-context pose injection mechanism, which allow for more robust and flexible animations, and by developing a curated data pipeline and benchmark for evaluating the performance of their method....
