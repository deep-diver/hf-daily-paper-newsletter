summary: The study presents Roblox Guard 1.0, a sophisticated language model that improves safety in large language models by moderating both inputs and outputs. This model, built on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, uses a combination of synthetic and open-source safety datasets, along with advanced techniques, to generalize across unseen safety categories and perform well on various safety benchmarks....
