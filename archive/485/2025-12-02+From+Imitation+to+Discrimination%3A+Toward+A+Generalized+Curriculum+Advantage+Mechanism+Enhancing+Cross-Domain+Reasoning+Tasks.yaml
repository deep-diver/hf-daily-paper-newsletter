summary: The study presents CAPO, a new method for training large language models that improves their reasoning abilities by using advantage signals. CAPO first learns from positive signals to build a strong foundation, then incorporates negative signals to enhance the model's ability to generalize across various complex scenarios, leading to stable and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning tasks and multimodal GUI reasoning scenarios....
