summary: The study presents TwinFlow, a framework for creating one-step generative models that surpasses existing methods in efficiency and scalability. TwinFlow achieves a high GenEval score with only one function evaluation, outperforming other baselines, and demonstrates its scalability by reducing computational cost by 100 times on a large-scale model with minimal quality loss....
