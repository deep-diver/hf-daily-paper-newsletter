summary: 'The authors present a new method to improve controllable video generation by enabling the model to assess its uncertainty, thus reducing hallucinations. The proposed method, C3, introduces three innovations: a novel training framework, latent-space uncertainty estimation, and pixel-level uncertainty mapping, resulting in more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates....'
