summary: The authors present a new method called MoRe4D that combines geometry reconstruction and motion generation for creating realistic 4D scenes from a single image. They introduce a large-scale dataset and a diffusion-based generator to produce consistent and plausible 4D point trajectories, resulting in high-quality dynamic scenes with multi-view consistency....
