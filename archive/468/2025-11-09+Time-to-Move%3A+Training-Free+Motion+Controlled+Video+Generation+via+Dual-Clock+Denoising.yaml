summary: The researchers developed a new method called Time-to-Move (TTM) that allows for precise motion and appearance control in video generation without requiring additional training or runtime cost. TTM uses user-friendly manipulations to create crude reference animations and employs dual-clock denoising to balance fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics, resulting in realistic videos with better motion control and precise appearance manipulation compared to existing methods....
