summary: The authors propose a new framework called MathSE to enhance multimodal mathematical reasoning in large language models. Unlike traditional methods, MathSE uses iterative refinement through cycles of inference, reflection, and reward-based feedback, resulting in significant performance improvements on challenging benchmarks....
