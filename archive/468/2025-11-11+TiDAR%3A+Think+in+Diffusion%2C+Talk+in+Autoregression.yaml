summary: This study presents TiDAR, a new model architecture that combines the fast parallel generation of diffusion models with the high-quality language modeling of autoregressive models. By drafting tokens in diffusion and sampling final outputs autoregressively, TiDAR achieves a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity, outperforming existing methods in terms of throughput and quality....
