summary: LoopTool is a new framework that improves the training of large language models (LLMs) by continuously refining the data and model through a closed-loop process. It uses three modules to diagnose model weaknesses, correct annotation errors, and generate challenging samples, resulting in a more efficient and effective training process that outperforms larger models on benchmarks....
