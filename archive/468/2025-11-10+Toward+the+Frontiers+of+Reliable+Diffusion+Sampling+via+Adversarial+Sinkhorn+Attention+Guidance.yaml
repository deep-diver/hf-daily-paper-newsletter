summary: This study presents Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a new method for improving diffusion models' performance by strategically disrupting attention scores using optimal transport and the Sinkhorn algorithm. ASAG enhances both conditional and unconditional sample quality in text-to-image diffusion and downstream applications like IP-Adapter and ControlNet without needing model retraining....
