summary: The study presents a unified reinforcement learning framework called OneReward that improves a model's ability to generate images across various tasks using a single vision-language model as a reward system. This framework is particularly useful for mask-guided image generation, which includes tasks like image fill, extend, and object removal, as it allows for training without task-specific supervised fine-tuning, resulting in better performance compared to existing methods....
