summary: The researchers developed a 14B math reasoning model, rStar2-Agent, using agentic reinforcement learning to achieve top-level performance in complex problem-solving. They employed three key innovations, including an efficient RL infrastructure, a resample-on-correct rollout strategy, and an agent training recipe, to enable advanced cognitive abilities and boost the model to state of the art in just 510 RL steps....
