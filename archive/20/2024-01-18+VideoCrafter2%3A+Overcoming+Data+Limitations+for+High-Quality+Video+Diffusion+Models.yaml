summary: The paper proposes VideoCrafter2, a method to overcome the limitations of data availability for high-quality video diffusion models. By leveraging low-quality videos and synthesized high-quality images, the model is trained to obtain a high-quality video model. The proposed method demonstrates superiority in picture quality, motion, and concept composition....
