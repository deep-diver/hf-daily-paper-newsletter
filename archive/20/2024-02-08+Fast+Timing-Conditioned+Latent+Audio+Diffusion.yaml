summary: This paper presents Stable Audio, a generative model that efficiently generates long-form, stereo music and sounds at 44.1kHz using text prompts and timing embeddings for fine control of content and length. Stable Audio is capable of generating complex music structures and stereo sounds with compute efficiency and fast inference, making it one of the best in two public text-to-music and audio benchmarks....
