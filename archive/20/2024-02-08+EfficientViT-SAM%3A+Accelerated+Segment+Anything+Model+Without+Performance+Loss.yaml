summary: This paper presents a new family of accelerated segment anything models, called EfficientViT-SAM. By replacing the heavy image encoder of SAM with the more efficient and capable EfficientViT, they achieve a 48.9x speedup on A100 GPU without losing performance, and they make their code and pre-trained models available for use....
