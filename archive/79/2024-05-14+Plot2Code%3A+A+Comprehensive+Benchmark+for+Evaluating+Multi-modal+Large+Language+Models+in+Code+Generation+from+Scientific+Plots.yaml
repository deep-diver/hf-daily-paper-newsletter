summary: Plot2Code is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of Multi-modal Large Language Models in generating code from scientific plots. It includes 132 manually selected high-quality matplotlib plots across six plot types, with their source code and a descriptive instruction summarized by GPT-4. Three automatic evaluation metrics are used for a fine-grained assessment of the output code and rendered images. The results highlight the challenges presented by Plot2Code and reveal that most existing ...
