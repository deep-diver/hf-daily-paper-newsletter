summary: The paper presents an efficient implementation of XGBoost in diffusion and flow-based models for tabular data generation, which can scale to datasets 370x larger than previous methods and leads to improved performance on benchmark tasks. The authors also propose algorithmic improvements and present results on large-scale scientific datasets derived from experimental particle physics....
