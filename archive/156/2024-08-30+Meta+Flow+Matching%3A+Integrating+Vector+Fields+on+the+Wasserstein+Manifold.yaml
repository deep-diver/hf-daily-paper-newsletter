summary: We present Meta Flow Matching (MFM), a method that integrates vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold to predict the temporal evolution of populations across various samples and environments. MFM uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to embed the population of samples and train a Flow Matching model, allowing it to generalize over initial distributions. This approach is particularly useful for personalized medicine, where the development of diseases and treatment responses depend on the unique mic...
