summary: We found a strong correlation between cross-modal alignment, vision representation correspondence, and MLLM performance. We quantified these factors using the AC score and found a linear correlation with model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we can identify and train the optimal vision representation without finetuning the language model every time, reducing computational cost by 99.7%....
