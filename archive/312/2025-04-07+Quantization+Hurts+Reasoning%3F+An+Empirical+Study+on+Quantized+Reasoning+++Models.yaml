summary: The study systematically evaluates the impact of quantization on reasoning language models, using various quantization methods at different bit-widths and assessing models from the DeepSeek-R1-Distilled Qwen, LLaMA, and QwQ-32B families. The results show that while lossless quantization is possible with certain bit-widths, lower bit-widths can introduce significant accuracy risks, and model size, origin, and task difficulty are crucial factors in performance. Additionally, strategically scaling ...
