summary: This study explores how small language models can verify their outputs during testing, and introduces Tool-integrated self-verification (T1) to improve this process by delegating memorization-heavy verification tasks to external tools, such as a code interpreter, and demonstrates the effectiveness of T1 in improving performance on both mathematical and multi-domain knowledge-intensive tasks....
