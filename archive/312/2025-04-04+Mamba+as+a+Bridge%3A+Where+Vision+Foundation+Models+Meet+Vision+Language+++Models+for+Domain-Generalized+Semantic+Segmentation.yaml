summary: This work proposes MFuser, a novel framework for combining Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a Mamba-based manner to improve Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). MFuser consists of MVFuser, which fine-tunes the models together, and MTEnhancer, which improves text embeddings using image priors. The model outperforms existing DGSS methods with improved mIoU scores and linear scalability....
