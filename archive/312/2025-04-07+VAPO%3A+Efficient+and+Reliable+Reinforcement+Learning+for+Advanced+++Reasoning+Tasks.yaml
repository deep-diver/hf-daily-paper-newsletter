summary: The authors have created VAPO, a framework using value-based reinforcement learning for advanced reasoning tasks, which outperforms previous models on the AIME 2024 dataset. VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B model, efficiently and reliably reaches state-of-the-art performance in just 5,000 steps with no training crashes in multiple runs, addressing challenges of value model bias, heterogeneous sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals in long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks....
