summary: The authors present a new framework called GimbalDiffusion that allows for precise and interpretable control over camera motion and orientation in text-to-video generation by using gravity as a global reference and defining camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system. They also introduce null-pitch conditioning to improve camera guidance and establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation, thereby enhancing the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models....
