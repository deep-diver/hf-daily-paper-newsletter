summary: This paper introduces a new learning rate scheduler called Power scheduler that is agnostic to batch size and the number of training tokens. It shows that the Power scheduler combined with Maximum Update Parameterization (muP) can achieve impressive performance with one set of hyperparameters regardless of the number of training tokens, batch size, model size, and even model architecture. The 3B dense and MoE models trained with the Power scheduler achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-...
