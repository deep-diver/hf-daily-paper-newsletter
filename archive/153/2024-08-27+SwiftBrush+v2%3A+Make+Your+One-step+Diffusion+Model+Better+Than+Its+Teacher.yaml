summary: In this paper, we improve SwiftBrush, a one-step text-to-image diffusion model, to compete with its multi-step counterpart, Stable Diffusion. We do this by changing how the model is trained, adding a new loss function, and combining weights from different models. Our new model is the best one-step diffusion model, with an FID of 8.14, and it's better than all GAN and multi-step Stable Diffusion models....
