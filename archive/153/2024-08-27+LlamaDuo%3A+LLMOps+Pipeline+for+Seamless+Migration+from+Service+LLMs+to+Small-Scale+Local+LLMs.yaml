summary: This paper proposes the LlamaDuo pipeline, which helps migrate knowledge and abilities from large, cloud-based language models to smaller, locally manageable models. This is useful for ensuring service continuity in cases of operational failures, privacy concerns, or offline requirements. The pipeline involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using synthetic data, and further fine-tuning with additional data if necessary. The goal is to make the smaller model match or s...
