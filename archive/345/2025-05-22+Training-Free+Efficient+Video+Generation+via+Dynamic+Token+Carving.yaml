summary: The authors present Jenga, a new method to speed up video generation using Diffusion Transformer models without needing to retrain them. Jenga combines dynamic attention carving and progressive resolution generation to achieve significant speedups (up to 8.83 times faster) while maintaining high-quality video generation by leveraging early denoising steps and later dense attention steps....
