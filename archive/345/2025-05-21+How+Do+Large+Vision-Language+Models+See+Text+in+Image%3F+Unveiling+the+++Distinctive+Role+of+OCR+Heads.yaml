summary: This study investigates how large vision-language models recognize text in images and identifies specific heads responsible for this task, called OCR Heads. The researchers find that these heads are less sparse, qualitatively distinct, and statically activated compared to general retrieval heads, and that improving OCR Heads enhances model performance....
