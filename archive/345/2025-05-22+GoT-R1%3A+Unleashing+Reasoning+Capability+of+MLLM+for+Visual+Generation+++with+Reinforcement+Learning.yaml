summary: The study presents GoT-R1, a framework that uses reinforcement learning to improve reasoning about meaning and spatial arrangement in image generation from text prompts. GoT-R1 helps models learn effective reasoning strategies and evaluates the process and final image based on semantic alignment, spatial accuracy, and visual quality, significantly enhancing performance on complex tasks....
