summary: This research explores the spatial understanding capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by introducing VGBench, a benchmark for visual geometry perception, and SpatialScore, a comprehensive multimodal spatial understanding benchmark. They also present SpatialAgent, a multi-agent system for spatial understanding, and conduct extensive evaluations to highlight challenges and demonstrate the system's effectiveness....
