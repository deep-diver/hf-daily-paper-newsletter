summary: This study reveals that a significant percentage of correct model outputs are wrongly rejected by verifiers in RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs, leading to slower convergence. The researchers propose a lightweight LLM-based verifier, tinyV, which improves pass rates and accelerates convergence by reducing false negatives in the verification process....
