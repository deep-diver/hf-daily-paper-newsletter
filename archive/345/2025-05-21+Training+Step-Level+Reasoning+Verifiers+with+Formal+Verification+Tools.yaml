summary: This study presents FoVer, a method that uses formal verification tools to automatically generate error labels for training Process Reward Models (PRMs) that provide step-by-step feedback for Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach improves verification performance across various reasoning tasks, even without human annotation, and outperforms existing PRMs on several benchmarks....
