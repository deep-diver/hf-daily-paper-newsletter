summary: The paper proposes a new method for Vision-Language Models to reason in pixel-space by using operations like zoom-in and select-frame, improving performance on visual tasks. This is achieved through a two-phase training process, combining instruction tuning and curiosity-driven reinforcement learning, resulting in state-of-the-art accuracy on various visual reasoning benchmarks....
