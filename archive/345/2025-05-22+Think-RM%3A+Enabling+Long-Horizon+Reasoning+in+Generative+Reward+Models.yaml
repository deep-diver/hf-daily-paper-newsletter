summary: The study presents Think-RM, a training framework that allows long-term reasoning in generative reward models by simulating an internal thought process. Think-RM produces flexible, self-guided reasoning traces that support advanced capabilities such as self-reflection and divergent reasoning, and it outperforms other models in RLHF tasks by 8%....
