summary: This paper introduces Generalized Instruction Tuning (GLAN), a method that
  generates large-scale synthetic instruction data across all disciplines using a
  pre-curated taxonomy of human knowledge and capabilities. It allows large language
  models (LLMs) to excel in various tasks without the need for task-specific training
  data, and it can be easily customized by adding new nodes to the taxonomy....
