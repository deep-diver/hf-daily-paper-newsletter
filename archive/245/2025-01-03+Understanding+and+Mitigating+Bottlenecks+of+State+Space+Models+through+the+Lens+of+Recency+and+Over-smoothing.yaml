summary: This paper discusses the limitations of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) in capturing long-sequence dependencies due to a strong recency bias, and how this bias impairs the models' ability to recall distant information and introduces robustness issues. The paper also explores the issue of over-smoothing in deeper SSM structures and proposes a polarization technique to address these issues....
