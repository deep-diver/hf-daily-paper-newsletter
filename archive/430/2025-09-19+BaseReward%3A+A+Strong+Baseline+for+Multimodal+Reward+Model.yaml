summary: The paper presents BaseReward, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling, built on a Qwen2.5-VL backbone with an optimized two-layer reward head. BaseReward outperforms previous models on major benchmarks and enhances MLLMs' performance in real-world tasks, offering a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models....
