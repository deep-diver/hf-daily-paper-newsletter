summary: 'The authors present a new method for optimizing camera parameters in dynamic scenes using only a single RGB video, which is more accurate and efficient than the current method (COLMAP) that requires additional information like ground truth motion masks. The method uses three components: Patch-wise Tracking Filters, Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, and A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to improve stability, speed, and accuracy of camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes....'
