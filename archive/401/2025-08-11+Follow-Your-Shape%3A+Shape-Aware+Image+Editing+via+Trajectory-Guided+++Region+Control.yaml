summary: The study presents a new method called Follow-Your-Shape that allows for precise and controllable editing of object shapes in images without affecting other areas. This technique uses a Trajectory Divergence Map to identify editable regions and ensures stable editing through a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism. The researchers also introduce a new benchmark, ReShapeBench, to evaluate the effectiveness of their method, which outperforms existing models in large-scale shape replacement tasks....
