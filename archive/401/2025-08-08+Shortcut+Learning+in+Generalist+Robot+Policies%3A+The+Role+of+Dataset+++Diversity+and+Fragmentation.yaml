summary: 'This study explores why generalist robot policies struggle to generalize beyond their training data and finds that relying on irrelevant features (shortcut learning) is the main issue. The research identifies two main causes: limited diversity within sub-datasets and significant differences between sub-datasets (fragmentation), which are common in large-scale datasets. The findings suggest strategies to improve dataset collection and use data augmentation to reduce shortcut learning and enhance ...'
