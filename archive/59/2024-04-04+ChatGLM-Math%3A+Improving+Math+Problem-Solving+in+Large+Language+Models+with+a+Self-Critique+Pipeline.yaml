summary: This paper proposes a Self-Critique pipeline to enhance a Large Language Model's (LLM) mathematical problem-solving abilities while maintaining its language capabilities. The pipeline uses a general Math-Critique model, rejective fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization, and outperforms LLMs that could be two times larger....
