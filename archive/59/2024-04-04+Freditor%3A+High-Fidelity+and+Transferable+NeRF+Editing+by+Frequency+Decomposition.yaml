summary: The paper presents an approach called Freditor that allows for high-fidelity and transferable NeRF (Neural Radiance Field) editing by frequency decomposition. This method enables stable intensity control and novel scene transfer by performing editing on low-frequency components, resulting in better edited scenes compared to previous approaches. Experiments on photorealistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Freditor....
