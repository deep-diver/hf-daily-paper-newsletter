summary: This paper introduces a method called 'Mixture-of-Depths' to dynamically allocate FLOPs (computation) to specific positions in a sequence in transformer-based language models. The method uses a top-k routing mechanism to determine which tokens to process, and can allocate FLOPs non-uniformly across the time and model depth dimensions. Models trained with this method require fewer FLOPs per forward pass and are faster to step during post-training sampling, while still achieving the same performan...
