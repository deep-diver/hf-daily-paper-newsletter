summary: This paper presents SceneScript, a method that uses an autoregressive, token-based approach to generate full scene models using structured language commands. The method uses a scene language encoder-decoder architecture and is trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset called Aria Synthetic Environments. SceneScript gives state-of-the-art results in architectural layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object detection, and has the advantage of being easily adaptable to new commands by a...
