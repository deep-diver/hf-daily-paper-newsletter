summary: The paper proposes a new way to estimate depth from a single image using flow matching, which is more efficient and high quality compared to other methods. The model is pre-trained on synthetic data and can predict confidence of its depth estimates, leading to state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with low computational cost....
