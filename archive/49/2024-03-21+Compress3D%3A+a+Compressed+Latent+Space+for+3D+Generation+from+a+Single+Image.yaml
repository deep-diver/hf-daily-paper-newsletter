summary: The paper presents a triplane autoencoder that compresses 3D geometry and texture information into a compact latent space, and introduces a 3D-aware cross-attention mechanism to enhance representation capacity. A diffusion model is trained on this latent space, using both image and shape embeddings as conditions, resulting in high-quality 3D asset generation with less training data and time....
