summary: RadSplat is a lightweight method for real-time rendering of complex scenes using radiance fields as a prior and supervision signal for optimizing point-based scene representations. It includes pruning techniques for reducing point count and a test-time filtering approach for accelerating rendering, enabling state-of-the-art synthesis at 900+ FPS for house-sized scenes....
