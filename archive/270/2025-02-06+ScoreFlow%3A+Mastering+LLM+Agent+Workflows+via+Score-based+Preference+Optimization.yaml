summary: The paper presents ScoreFlow, a framework that uses gradient-based optimization in a continuous space to improve agent workflow optimization in large language models. Score-DPO, a new method for handling quantitative feedback, is incorporated into ScoreFlow, which outperforms existing methods by 8.2% and enables smaller models to perform better than larger ones with lower costs....
