summary: The proposed Heterogeneous Masked Autoregression (HMA) model addresses the challenge of building interactive video world models and policies for robotics by improving visual fidelity and controllability, and achieving 15 times faster speed in real world applications. HMA uses heterogeneous pre-training from observations and action sequences across different robotic embodiments, domains, and tasks, and utilizes masked autoregression to generate tokens for video predictions, which can also be used...
