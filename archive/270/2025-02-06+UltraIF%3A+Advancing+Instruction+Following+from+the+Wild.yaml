summary: The paper introduces UltraIF, a simple and scalable approach for building large language models (LLMs) that can follow complex instructions using open-source data. UltraIF decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries and constraints, then trains an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions, enabling the synthesis of complicated instructions and response filtering. The method successfully aligned LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base with its instruct version on 5 in...
