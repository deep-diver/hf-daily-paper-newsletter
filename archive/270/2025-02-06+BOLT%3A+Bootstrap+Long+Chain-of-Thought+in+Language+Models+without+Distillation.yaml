summary: 'The paper presents a method called BOLT, which enables long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capacity in large language models without relying on distillation from models like o1 or expensive human annotations. BOLT consists of three stages: data bootstrapping, supervised finetuning, and online training, and it achieves strong performance on various benchmarks using Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and other model scales....'
