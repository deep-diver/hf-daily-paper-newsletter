summary: The paper presents a novel framework called Weak-to-Strong Diffusion (W2SD) to improve the gap between generated outputs and real data in diffusion generative models. W2SD uses the difference between weak and strong models to approximate the gap and steers latent variables towards real data distribution, achieving SOTA performance in various modalities, architectures, and benchmarks....
