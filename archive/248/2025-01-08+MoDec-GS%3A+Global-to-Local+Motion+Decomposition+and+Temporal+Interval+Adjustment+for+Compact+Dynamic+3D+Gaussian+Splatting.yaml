summary: MoDec-GS is a memory-efficient framework for reconstructing dynamic scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting. It uses Global-to-Local Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to capture complex motions and Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to optimize temporal coverage. This results in a 70% reduction in model size compared to existing methods while maintaining or improving rendering quality....
