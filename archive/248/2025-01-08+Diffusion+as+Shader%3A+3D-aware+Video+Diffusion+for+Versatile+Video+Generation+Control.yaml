summary: This paper proposes a new method called Diffusion as Shader (DaS) that allows for better control of video generation by using 3D tracking videos as control inputs. This makes the video diffusion process more aware of 3D content and allows for a wider range of video controls. Additionally, using 3D tracking videos helps to improve the temporal consistency of the generated videos. DaS is trained on a small dataset and still performs well across various tasks such as mesh-to-video generation, camer...
