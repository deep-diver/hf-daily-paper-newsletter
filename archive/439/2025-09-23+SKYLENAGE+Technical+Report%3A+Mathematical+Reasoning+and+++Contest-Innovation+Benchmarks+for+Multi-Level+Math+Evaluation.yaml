summary: The authors created two new math benchmarks, SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and SKYLENAGE-MATH, to better evaluate the mathematical reasoning abilities of language models. They tested 15 language models on these benchmarks and found that the strongest model could only achieve 44% accuracy on the contest-style suite and 81% accuracy on the reasoning-centered suite, with performance declining as the difficulty increased....
