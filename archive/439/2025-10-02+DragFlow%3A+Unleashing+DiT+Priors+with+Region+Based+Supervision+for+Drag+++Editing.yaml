summary: This study presents a new method called DragFlow that uses a region-based approach to improve drag-based image editing by leveraging stronger generative priors in DiTs. Compared to existing methods, DragFlow significantly enhances image editing performance by utilizing affine transformations, pretrained personalization adapters, and multimodal large language models, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on two benchmarks....
