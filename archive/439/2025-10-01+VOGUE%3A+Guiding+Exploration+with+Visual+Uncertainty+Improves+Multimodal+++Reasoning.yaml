summary: This study presents a new method called VOGUE that improves multimodal reasoning by focusing on visual uncertainty during exploration, rather than just text output. By treating images as uncertain and using this uncertainty to guide exploration, VOGUE enhances performance on various visual math and general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while also addressing the exploration decay issue in RL fine-tuning....
