summary: The study presents a new training objective called MW loss for dual-encoder retrievers, which improves score separation quality and retrieval performance compared to the existing NCE objective. MW loss maximizes the Mann-Whitney U statistic and is equivalent to AUC, leading to better-calibrated and more discriminative retrievers in high-stakes applications like RAG....
