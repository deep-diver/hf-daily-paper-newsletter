summary: The research presents Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a new attention mechanism that cuts down the number of Query heads to decrease computational complexity and FLOPs, unlike previous methods. Experiments show that SQA can improve throughput by up to 3x in computation-bound tasks without significantly affecting model quality....
