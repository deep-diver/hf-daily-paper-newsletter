summary: This study examines how feed-forward networks in large language models make use of their latent space, finding that widening them adds mostly low-energy directions while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early, leading to underutilization of the latent space. The research provides guidance for designing more efficient language models by balancing tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity....
