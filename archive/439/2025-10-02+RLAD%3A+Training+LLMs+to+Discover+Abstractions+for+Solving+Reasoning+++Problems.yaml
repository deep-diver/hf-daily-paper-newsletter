summary: The study presents a new training method, RLAD, for large language models to learn reasoning skills by discovering abstractions, which are concise descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge. This method enables the models to propose multiple abstractions for a given problem and then build solutions using these abstractions, leading to improved generalization and more effective reasoning....
