summary: The paper introduces a novel inference framework called Synchronized Coupled Sampling (SynCoS) to address the challenge of long video generation using text-to-video diffusion models. SynCoS synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video, ensuring long-range consistency and smoother transitions by combining reverse and optimization-based sampling strategies....
