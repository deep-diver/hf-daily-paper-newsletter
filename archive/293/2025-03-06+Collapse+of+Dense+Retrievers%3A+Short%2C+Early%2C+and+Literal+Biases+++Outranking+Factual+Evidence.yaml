summary: The paper investigates the performance of dense retrieval models, such as Dragon+ and Contriever, and finds that they are prone to heuristic biases like favoring shorter documents and literal matches over factual evidence. These biases can lead to catastrophic performance degradation, causing models to overlook the answer-containing document in over 97% of cases, and have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, leading to a 34% performance drop....
