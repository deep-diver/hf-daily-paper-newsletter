summary: The paper proposes a new task called Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT) to assess fine-grained pixel understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), by having them mimic human annotators in interactive segmentation. HLMAT is modeled as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, allowing MLLMs to generate text-based click points for high-quality masks without altering the model architecture. The paper also introduces a fine-tuned model, SegAgent, which achieves state-of-the-art perform...
