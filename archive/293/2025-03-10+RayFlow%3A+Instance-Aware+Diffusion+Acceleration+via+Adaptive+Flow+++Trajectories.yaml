summary: The proposed RayFlow framework guides each sample along a unique path towards an instance-specific target distribution, minimizing sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability. Additionally, Time Sampler, an importance sampling technique, is introduced to enhance training efficiency by focusing on crucial timesteps, resulting in high-quality image generation with improved speed, control, and training efficiency compared to existing acceleration techniques....
