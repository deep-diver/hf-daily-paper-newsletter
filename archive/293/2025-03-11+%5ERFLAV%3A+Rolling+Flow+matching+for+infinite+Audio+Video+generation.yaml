summary: The paper presents a new transformer-based architecture for audio-video generation that meets challenges like sample quality, multimodal synchronization, and temporal coherence. It examines different cross-modality interaction modules and finds its lightweight temporal fusion module as the best and most efficient method for aligning audio and visual modalities, outperforming other models in multimodal AV generation tasks....
