summary: This work presents OTTER, a novel Vision-Language-Action architecture that leverages pre-trained alignments for improved action prediction. OTTER extracts only task-relevant visual features, allowing the use of pre-trained vision-language models, enhancing zero-shot generalization capabilities and outperforming existing models in simulation and real-world experiments....
