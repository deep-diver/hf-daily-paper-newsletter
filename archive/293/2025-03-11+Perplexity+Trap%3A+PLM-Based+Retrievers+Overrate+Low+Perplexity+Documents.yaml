summary: The paper identifies that PLM-based retrievers overrate low perplexity documents, causing source bias, and explains this phenomenon through a causal graph, revealing that the positive correlation between the gradients of language modeling and retrieval tasks leads to this issue. It proposes a causal-inspired inference-time debiasing method, Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC), which diagnoses the bias effect of perplexity and separates it from the overall estimated relevance score, demonstrati...
