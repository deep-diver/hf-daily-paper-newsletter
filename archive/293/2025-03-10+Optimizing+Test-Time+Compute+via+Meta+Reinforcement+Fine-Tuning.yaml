summary: The paper discusses a new approach to optimizing test-time compute for LLMs using meta-reinforcement learning (RL), which views the output stream as multiple episodes and uses cumulative regret to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. The approach leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL....
