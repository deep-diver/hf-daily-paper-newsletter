summary: This paper evaluates the performance of different quantization methods on instruction-tuned LLMs of varying sizes and finds that larger models generally perform better when quantized, performance varies with different methods, and task difficulty does not significantly impact accuracy degradation due to quantization. The MT-Bench evaluation method has limited discriminatory power among recent high-performing LLMs....
