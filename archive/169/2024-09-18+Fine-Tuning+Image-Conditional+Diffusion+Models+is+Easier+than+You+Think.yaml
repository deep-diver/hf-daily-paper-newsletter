summary: A paper discusses how a flaw in the inference pipeline of a depth estimation model caused its inefficiency, which has been overlooked. The fixed model is 200 times faster and outperforms other models when fine-tuned with task-specific losses. The fine-tuning protocol also works on Stable Diffusion, achieving comparable performance to current state-of-the-art models....
