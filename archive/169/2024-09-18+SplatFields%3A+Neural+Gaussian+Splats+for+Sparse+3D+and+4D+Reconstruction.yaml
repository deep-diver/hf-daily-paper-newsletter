summary: This paper introduces a new method called SplatFields that improves the quality of 3D and 4D reconstruction by using neural Gaussian splats to regularize splat features and handle both static and dynamic scenes. The method addresses the challenge of sparse reconstruction settings and improves the performance of the 3D Gaussian Splatting technique....
