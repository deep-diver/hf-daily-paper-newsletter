summary: This paper introduces a hierarchical learning and control framework that enables a quadrupedal robot to perform agile and continuous jumps on human-sized stairs and sparse stepping stones. The framework consists of a learned heightmap predictor for robust terrain perception, a reinforcement-learning-based centroidal-level motion policy for versatile and terrain-adaptive planning, and a low-level model-based leg controller for accurate motion tracking. The robot can cross two stair steps in each ...
