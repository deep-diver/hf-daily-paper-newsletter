summary: This paper proposes a new framework that uses natural language interactions and foundation models to reduce the manual effort required to define a visual concept by an order of magnitude, compared to traditional methods. The framework ultimately produces lightweight classification models that are deployable in cost-sensitive scenarios, and outperforms traditional Agile Modeling as well as state-of-the-art zero-shot classification models....
