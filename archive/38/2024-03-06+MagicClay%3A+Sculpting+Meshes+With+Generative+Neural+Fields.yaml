summary: This paper proposes a hybrid approach that maintains both a mesh and a Signed
  Distance Field representation for shape generation. It introduces MagicClay, an
  artist-friendly tool for sculpting meshes according to textual prompts while keeping
  other regions untouched. The framework balances consistency and regularizations
  in shape optimization, and the mesh representation allows for faster and higher
  resolution rendering of the SDF....
