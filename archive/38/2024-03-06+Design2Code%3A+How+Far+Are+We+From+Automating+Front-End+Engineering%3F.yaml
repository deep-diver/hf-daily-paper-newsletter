summary: This paper investigates the feasibility of automating front-end engineering using multimodal LLMs and conducts comprehensive benchmarking. They develop a benchmark of 484 real-world webpages, evaluate models like GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision, and show that GPT-4V performs the best. Human evaluations also show that GPT-4V generated webpages can be considered better than the original reference webpages in some cases....
