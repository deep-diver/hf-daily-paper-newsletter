summary: A new method called Mixture-of-Resolution Adaptation (MRA) was proposed to improve the visual recognition abilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The method combines low- and high-resolution visual features and reduces the input sequence length of MLLMs. The new model, called LLaVA-HR, outperforms existing MLLMs on 8 out of 11 vision-language tasks and is more efficient in training and inference....
