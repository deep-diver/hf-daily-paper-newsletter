summary: GazeGen is a system that generates images and videos based on a user's eye gaze. It uses a small, lightweight model called DFT Gaze to predict gaze points accurately and in real-time. This allows users to control visual content generation tasks, such as adding, deleting, or repositioning objects, with their gaze. DFT Gaze is derived from a larger model using knowledge distillation and personal adaptation techniques, resulting in a compact yet powerful gaze estimation model. The system is validat...
