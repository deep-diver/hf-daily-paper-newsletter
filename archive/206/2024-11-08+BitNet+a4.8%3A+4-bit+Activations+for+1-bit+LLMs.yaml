summary: This paper presents BitNet a4.8, a 4-bit activation for 1-bit LLMs that uses a hybrid quantization and sparsification strategy to reduce inference cost while maintaining performance. It achieves comparable performance to BitNet b1.58 with equivalent training costs and faster inference using 4-bit kernels....
