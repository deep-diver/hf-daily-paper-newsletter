summary: This paper presents DimensionX, a framework that uses video diffusion to generate realistic 3D and 4D scenes from a single image. It does this by learning to separate spatial and temporal factors in videos, allowing for precise control over the structure and dynamics of the scenes. The framework also includes mechanisms to improve the realism of the generated scenes....
