summary: This paper presents Diffusion-RWKV, a series of architectures adapted from the RWKV model used in NLP for image generation tasks. This model is designed to efficiently handle patchnified inputs and is capable of scaling up while reducing spatial aggregation complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution image processing....
