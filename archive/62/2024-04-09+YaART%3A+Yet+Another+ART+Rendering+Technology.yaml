summary: This paper introduces YaART, a production-grade text-to-image diffusion model that uses Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences. The authors analyze the impact of model and dataset size on training efficiency and image quality, and find that models trained on smaller datasets of higher-quality images can compete with larger ones. YaART is preferred by users over many existing state-of-the-art models....
