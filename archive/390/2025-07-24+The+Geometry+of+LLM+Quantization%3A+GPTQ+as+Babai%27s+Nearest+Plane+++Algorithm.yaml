summary: This study reveals that GPTQ, a common method for compressing large language models, is equivalent to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for solving a classical problem called the closest vector problem. This discovery provides a stronger theoretical foundation for GPTQ and could lead to improved quantization algorithms for even larger models....
