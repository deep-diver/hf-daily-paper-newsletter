summary: This study presents a new framework called BSC-Nav that helps embodied agents build and use structured spatial memory, enabling them to navigate complex environments more effectively. By creating cognitive maps and retrieving spatial knowledge aligned with goals, BSC-Nav, when combined with powerful language models, outperforms existing methods, generalizes better, and supports versatile behaviors in the real world....
