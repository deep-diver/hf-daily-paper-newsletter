summary: The authors present a new approach using Pairwise Reward Model (Pairwise RM) and a knockout tournament to improve Best-of-N sampling for Large Language Models. Pairwise RM compares two solutions simultaneously to eliminate arbitrary scoring and enable cross-validation, while the knockout tournament iteratively compares and eliminates incorrect solutions. The proposed method outperforms traditional reward models, especially on challenging problems....
