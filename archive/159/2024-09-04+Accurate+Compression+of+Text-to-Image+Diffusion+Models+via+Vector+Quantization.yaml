summary: This paper explores the use of vector quantization to compress large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, aiming to improve accessibility in resource-limited environments. It demonstrates that vector quantization can achieve higher compression rates compared to uniform scalar quantization, and presents tailored vector-based post-training quantization methods for billion-scale text-to-image models, resulting in similar image quality and textual alignment even when compressed to around 3 bits....
