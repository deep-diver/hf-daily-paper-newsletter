summary: We developed an efficient training strategy called LongRecipe to improve large language models' ability to handle long context tasks, reducing computational resources by 85% compared to full sequence training, and extending the effective context window of open-source LLMs from 8k to 128k with just one day of training using a single GPU with 80G memory....
