summary: We have developed a new method called DepthCrafter to generate accurate and consistent depth sequences for open-world videos. This method does not require any additional information like camera positions or movement, and it can handle videos of any length. DepthCrafter is trained using a combination of real and synthetic datasets, and it can generate depth sequences with both precise details and a wide range of content. It also has the ability to process very long videos and can be used for vari...
