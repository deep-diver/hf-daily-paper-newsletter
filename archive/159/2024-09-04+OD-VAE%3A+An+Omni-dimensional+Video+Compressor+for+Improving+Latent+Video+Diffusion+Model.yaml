summary: This paper proposes a new video compression method called OD-VAE that can compress videos in both space and time dimensions. The method is designed to improve the efficiency of Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs) by compressing videos more efficiently while still achieving high reconstruction accuracy. The paper also introduces four variants of OD-VAE and a new way to train it more efficiently. Experiments show that the proposed method is effective and efficient for video reconstruction and LV...
