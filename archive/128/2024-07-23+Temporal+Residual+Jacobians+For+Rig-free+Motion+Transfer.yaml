summary: This paper presents Temporal Residual Jacobians, a new technique for transferring motion between different objects without the need for rigging or intermediate shape keyframes. The method uses two neural networks to predict local geometric and temporal changes, which are then integrated to produce the final animated meshes. The networks are trained together and are supervised directly with 3D positional information. The method is tested on various meshes and is shown to generate more realistic a...
