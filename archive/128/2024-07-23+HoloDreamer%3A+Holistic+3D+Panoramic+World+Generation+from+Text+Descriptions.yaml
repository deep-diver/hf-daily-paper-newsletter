summary: HoloDreamer is a framework that generates a high-definition panorama as a holistic initialization of the full 3D scene, then uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) to quickly reconstruct the 3D scene, thereby facilitating the creation of view-consistent and fully enclosed 3D scenes from complex text prompts. The method outperforms prior works in terms of overall visual consistency and harmony as well as reconstruction quality and rendering robustness when generating fully enclosed scenes....
