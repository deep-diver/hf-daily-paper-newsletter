summary: The paper introduces MIBench, a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) when handling multiple images. MIBench categorizes the multi-image abilities into three scenarios and constructs 13 tasks with a total of 13K annotated samples. The results show that current models struggle with multi-image inputs, such as confused fine-grained perception, limited multi-image reasoning, and unstable in-context learning....
