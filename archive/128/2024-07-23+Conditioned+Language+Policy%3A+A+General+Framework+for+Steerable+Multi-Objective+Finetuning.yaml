summary: This paper proposes a general framework called Conditioned Language Policy (CLP) for finetuning language models on multiple objectives. CLP learns steerable models that effectively trade-off conflicting objectives at inference time without requiring training or maintaining multiple models. The framework outperforms and Pareto-dominates current state-of-the-art approaches for multi-objective finetuning, as demonstrated through extensive experiments and ablations....
