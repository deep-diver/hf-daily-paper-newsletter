summary: This study introduces a new framework called Adaptive Exploration Policy Optimization (AEPO) to improve the performance of autonomous agents operating on graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). AEPO addresses the challenge of semantic alignment by encouraging broader exploration and guiding it with a theoretically grounded Adaptive Exploration Reward function, resulting in significant improvements on various GUI grounding benchmarks....
