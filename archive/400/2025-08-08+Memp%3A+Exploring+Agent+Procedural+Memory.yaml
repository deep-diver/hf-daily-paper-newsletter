summary: This study presents a method to improve agents' procedural memory, allowing them to learn, update, and retain information over time. The proposed Memp system converts past agent experiences into detailed instructions and general scripts, which are then dynamically updated. Experiments show that as this memory repository improves, agents perform better and more efficiently on similar tasks, and even transferring memory from a stronger model to a weaker one boosts performance....
