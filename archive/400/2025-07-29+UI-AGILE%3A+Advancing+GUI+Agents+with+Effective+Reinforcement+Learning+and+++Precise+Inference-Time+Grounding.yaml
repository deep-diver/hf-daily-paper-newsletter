summary: The research presents UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework to enhance GUI agents by improving training and inference processes. This involves a new continuous reward function, a 'Simple Thinking' reward, and a resampling strategy for training, as well as a novel method for inference that breaks images into smaller parts to improve accuracy, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and ScreenSpot-v2....
