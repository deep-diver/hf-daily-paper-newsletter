summary: This paper explores the use of domain-specific language models for generating MPI-based parallel programs. It finds that larger models perform worse than domain-specific models, and then introduces a specific model, MPIrigen, fine-tuned for MPI code generation. MPIrigen outperforms a larger model in a novel evaluation method, suggesting that domain-specific fine-tuning is important for code generation in parallel computing....
