summary: This paper introduces BetterDepth, a refining tool for depth estimation in images. It uses a pre-trained model to capture the overall depth context and then refines the details based on the input image. BetterDepth is trained on small-scale synthetic datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse public datasets and in-the-wild scenes. It can also improve the performance of other depth estimation models without additional training....
