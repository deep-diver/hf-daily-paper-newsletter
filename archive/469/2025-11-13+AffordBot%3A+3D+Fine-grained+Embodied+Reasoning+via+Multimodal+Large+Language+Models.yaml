summary: The authors propose a new task called Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict the spatial location, motion type, and motion axis of each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene based on a task instruction. They introduce AffordBot, a framework that uses Multimodal Large Language Models and a specialized reasoning process to solve this task, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SceneFun3D dataset....
