summary: The researchers present LikeBench, a new framework for evaluating the likability of language models in personalization. They argue that likability, which is subjective and important for user experience, is not well-measured in current benchmarks. LikeBench assesses likability across seven dimensions, including emotional adaptation and humor fit, using realistic simulated users. The study reveals that strong memory performance does not guarantee high likability, as a model with lower memory accur...
