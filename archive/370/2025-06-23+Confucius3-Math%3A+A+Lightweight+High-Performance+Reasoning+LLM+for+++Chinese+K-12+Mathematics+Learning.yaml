summary: 'The researchers have developed an open-source language model called Confucius3-Math, specifically designed for Chinese K-12 mathematics learning. This model is efficient, running on a single consumer-grade GPU, and outperforms larger models in mathematical reasoning tasks by using three technical innovations: Targeted Entropy Regularization, Recent Sample Recovery, and Policy-Specific Hardness Weighting....'
