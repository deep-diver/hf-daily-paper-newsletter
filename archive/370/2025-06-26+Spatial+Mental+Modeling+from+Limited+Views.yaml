summary: The study presents a new benchmark to evaluate the ability of vision language models in forming spatial mental models, or internal representations of unseen space, by analyzing their performance in tasks related to position, orientation, and dynamics. The researchers then propose and test various methods to enhance the models' spatial understanding, ultimately achieving a significant improvement by training them to first generate a cognitive map and then reason upon it, boosting accuracy from 37...
