summary: The study presents a new method called Noise Consistency Training (NCT) that allows for the integration of new control signals into pre-trained one-step generators without the need for retraining or access to original training images. NCT is efficient, modular, and easily deployable, and it outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and computational efficiency....
