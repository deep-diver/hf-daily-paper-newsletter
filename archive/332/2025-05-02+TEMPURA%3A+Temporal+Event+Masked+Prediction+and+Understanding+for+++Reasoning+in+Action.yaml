summary: The authors present a new training framework called TEMPURA that improves video understanding by combining causal reasoning with fine-grained temporal segmentation. TEMPURA first predicts missing events and creates step-by-step explanations, then segments videos and adds detailed, timestamp-aligned descriptions. The method is tested on a large dataset and outperforms existing models in temporal grounding and highlight detection tasks....
