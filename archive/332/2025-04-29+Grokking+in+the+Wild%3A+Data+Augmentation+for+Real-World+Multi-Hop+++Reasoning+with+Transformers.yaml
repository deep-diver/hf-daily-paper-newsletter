summary: This study explores how to improve real-world multi-step reasoning in language models by enhancing their ability to recognize patterns, even in sparse data. By adding synthetic data to real-world knowledge graphs, the model's performance on multi-hop reasoning tasks significantly improves, achieving up to 100% accuracy on certain benchmarks, all while relying less on memorization and more on logical relationships....
