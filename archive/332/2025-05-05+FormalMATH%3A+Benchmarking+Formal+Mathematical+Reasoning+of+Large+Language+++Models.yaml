summary: The authors created a large-scale benchmark called FormalMATH for testing formal mathematical reasoning of large language models, which consists of 5,560 problems. They also developed a new method to reduce the time and cost of creating this benchmark by using specialized AI models and negation-based strategies, but found that even the best models struggle with the benchmark and are biased towards certain domains....
