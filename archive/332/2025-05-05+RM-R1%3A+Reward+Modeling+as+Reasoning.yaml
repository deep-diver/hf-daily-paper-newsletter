summary: The study proposes a new type of reward model called Reasoning Reward Models (ReasRMs) that improves the interpretability and performance of reward modeling in AI by incorporating reasoning capabilities. These models, named RM-R1, generate reasoning traces or rubrics to evaluate responses and outperform larger models in various benchmarks....
