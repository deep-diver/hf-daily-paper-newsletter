summary: This study presents a new method called PIPS that enhances large language models' reasoning ability by generating and refining programs for each input, using feedback and a confidence metric to choose between direct inference and program synthesis. Experiments show that PIPS significantly improves accuracy and reduces undesirable solutions compared to other methods, especially in complex reasoning tasks....
