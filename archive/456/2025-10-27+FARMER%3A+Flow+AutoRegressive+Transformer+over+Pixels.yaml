summary: This study presents a new framework called FARMER that combines Normalizing Flows and Autoregressive models to improve image generation and likelihood estimation from raw pixels. FARMER reduces complexity by partitioning data into informative and redundant groups, speeds up inference, and enhances image quality through various techniques, outperforming existing pixel-based generative models....
