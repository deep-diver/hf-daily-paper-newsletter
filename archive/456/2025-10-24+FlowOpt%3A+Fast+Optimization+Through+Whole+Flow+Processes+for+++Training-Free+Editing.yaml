summary: The study presents a new framework, FlowOpt, which enables efficient and gradient-free optimization of entire flow processes for tasks like image editing and restoration. This method treats the process as a black box, allowing for optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation, and achieves state-of-the-art results with similar neural function evaluations compared to existing methods....
