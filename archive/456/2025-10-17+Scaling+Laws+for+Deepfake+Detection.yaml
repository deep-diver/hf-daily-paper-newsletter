summary: The study analyzes the performance of deepfake detection models using a new large-scale dataset, ScaleDF, containing over 14.6 million images. The researchers observe a power-law scaling relationship, similar to large language models, where improving the number of real domains or deepfake methods leads to a predictable decrease in detection error, which can help forecast the data needed for better performance....
