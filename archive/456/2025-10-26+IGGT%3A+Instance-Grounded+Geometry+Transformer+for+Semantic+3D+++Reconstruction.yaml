summary: This study presents a new transformer model, IGGT, which can understand both the geometric structure and object instances in a 3D scene using only 2D visual inputs. The model is trained using a novel contrastive learning strategy and a large-scale dataset, enabling it to accurately reconstruct 3D scenes with distinct object instances....
