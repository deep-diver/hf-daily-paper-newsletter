summary: The study presents VoMP, a method that predicts the mechanical properties of 3D objects, such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density, throughout their volume. VoMP uses a trained Geometry Transformer to estimate these properties accurately and quickly, making it a significant improvement over existing techniques....
