summary: The authors propose a new method for language modeling, called memory-based language modeling, which is more efficient, eco-friendly, and transparent than deep neural network-based methods. This approach uses a log-linear scalable algorithm and fast approximations, making it faster and less harmful to the environment, while also being easier to understand than traditional methods....
