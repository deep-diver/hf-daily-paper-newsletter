summary: This study is the first to explore attention sinks and massive activations in multimodal speech recognition, identifying them in audio-visual LLMs during ASR, VSR, and AVSR. The researchers found that these activations originate in MLP layers and proposed a decorrelation loss to reduce their impact, which improved WER in high audio-visual feature downsampling while maintaining stability at lower rates....
