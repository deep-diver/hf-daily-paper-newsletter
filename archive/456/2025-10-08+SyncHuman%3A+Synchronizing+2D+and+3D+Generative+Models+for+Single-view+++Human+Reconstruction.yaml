summary: The study presents SyncHuman, a framework that merges 2D multiview and 3D native generative models to improve single-view human reconstruction, especially for challenging poses. By combining the strengths of both models and using a pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention, SyncHuman generates accurate and high-quality 3D human meshes with fine details....
