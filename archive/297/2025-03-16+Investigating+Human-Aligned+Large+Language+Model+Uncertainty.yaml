summary: This study explores different ways to measure the uncertainty of large language models, focusing on those that align with human judgments. The research finds that Bayesian measures and a variation on entropy measures, known as top-k entropy, generally agree with human behavior as the model size increases. However, some strong measures become less human-like with larger models. The study also discovers that combining multiple uncertainty measures can provide similar human alignment with less depe...
