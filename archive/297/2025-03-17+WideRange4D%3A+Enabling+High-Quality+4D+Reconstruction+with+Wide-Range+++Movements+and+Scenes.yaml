summary: The authors present a new 4D reconstruction benchmark, WideRange4D, for evaluating the generation capabilities of 4D methods in scenarios with large spatial variations. They also propose Progress4D, a novel 4D reconstruction method that outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons....
