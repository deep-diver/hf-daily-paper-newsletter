summary: The V-STaR benchmark challenges Video-LLMs to understand object interactions in videos based on spatio-temporal reasoning, addressing shortcomings in existing benchmarks that focus on object presence. The benchmark uses a reverse spatio-temporal reasoning task with explicit CoT questions generated by a GPT-4 powered pipeline, revealing gaps in current Video-LLMs' ability to perform robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning....
