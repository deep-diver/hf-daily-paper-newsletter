summary: The paper introduces **reWordBench**, a tool that investigates the robustness of reward models, which are often used in modern NLP, by transforming their inputs. The authors find that current models are fragile and can suffer from significant performance drops with minor transformations. They propose a method to train reward models to handle paraphrases better, which reduces degradation and improves the models' usage in alignment for higher-quality outputs....
