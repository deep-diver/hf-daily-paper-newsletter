summary: The paper presents a unified framework called Meta-ARVDM for analyzing and improving Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models (ARVDM). The authors discover two key issues, error accumulation and memory bottleneck, in ARVDM. To address the memory bottleneck, they propose new network structures and show that compressing frames can strike a better balance between reducing memory bottleneck and maintaining inference efficiency. Their experimental results on DMLab and Minecraft datasets confirm the eff...
