summary: The paper introduces a new method called Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO) to improve the reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike traditional methods that only focus on imitating successful reasoning paths, StepGRPO uses two novel rule-based rewards, StepRAR and StepRVR, to encourage MLLMs to understand and avoid wrong reasoning paths, leading to the creation of R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with strong step-by-step reasoning capabilities....
