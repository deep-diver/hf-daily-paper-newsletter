summary: The study presents a new method for training large language models to reason efficiently by gradually reducing their token budgets over time, encouraging them to discover effective solution strategies and then distill them into more concise reasoning traces. The proposed strategy, using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), consistently outperforms fixed-budget baselines in accuracy and token efficiency across various experiments, demonstrating the power of progressive constraint as an indu...
