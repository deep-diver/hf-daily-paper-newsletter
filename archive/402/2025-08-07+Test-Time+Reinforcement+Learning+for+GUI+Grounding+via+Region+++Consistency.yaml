summary: This study presents two methods, GUI-RC and GUI-RCPO, which improve the accuracy of mapping natural language instructions to screen coordinates for GUI agents. GUI-RC uses multiple predictions to identify consensus regions, while GUI-RCPO refines outputs through test-time reinforcement learning, resulting in significant performance improvements on various architectures....
