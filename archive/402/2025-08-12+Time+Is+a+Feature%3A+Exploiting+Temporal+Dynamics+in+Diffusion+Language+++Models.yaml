summary: 'The study finds that diffusion language models often overwrite correct answers during the denoising process. To improve accuracy, they introduce two methods: Temporal Self-Consistency Voting, which selects the most consistent prediction across steps, and Temporal Consistency Reinforcement, which encourages stable generations using Temporal Semantic Entropy as a reward signal. These methods significantly improve performance on various benchmarks....'
