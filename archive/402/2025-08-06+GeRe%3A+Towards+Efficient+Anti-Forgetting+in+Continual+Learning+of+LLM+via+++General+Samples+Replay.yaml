summary: The paper presents a framework called General Sample Replay (GeRe) that uses pretraining texts to efficiently prevent large language models from forgetting general capabilities while learning new tasks. This framework introduces a new optimization method that maintains activation state consistency, which helps improve performance and robustness compared to other replay strategies....
