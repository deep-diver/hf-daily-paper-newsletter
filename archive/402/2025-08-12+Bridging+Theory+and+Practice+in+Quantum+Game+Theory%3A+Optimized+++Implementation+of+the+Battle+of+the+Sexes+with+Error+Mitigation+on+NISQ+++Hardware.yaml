summary: The study executes the Battle of the Sexes game on IBM Quantum's hardware using a new method to reduce errors caused by noise and hardware limitations. Results show that quantum strategies can still outperform classical ones even with these challenges, suggesting potential real-world uses for quantum game theory....
