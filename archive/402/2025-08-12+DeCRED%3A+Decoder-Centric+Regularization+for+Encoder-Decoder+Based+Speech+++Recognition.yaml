summary: The study proposes a method called DeCRED, which enhances the performance of speech recognition models by adding auxiliary classifiers to the decoder. This results in improved word error rates and better generalization in various testing scenarios, even outperforming other popular models like Whisper-medium, all while using less data and fewer parameters....
