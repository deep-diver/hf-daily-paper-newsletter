summary: This study focuses on improving the Change Detection Visual Question Answering task by addressing domain shift, introducing a new dataset called BrightVQA for domain generalization research. They propose a novel state space model, TCSSM, which uses both bi-temporal imagery and geo-disaster-related textual information to extract domain-invariant features, outperforming state-of-the-art models in extensive experiments....
