summary: This research presents a new method for applying styles to 3D shapes using Gaussian splats without the need for reconstruction or optimization. The proposed technique involves creating a graph on the shape's surface, applying style, and then transferring it back to the splats, resulting in fast and high-quality style transfer without additional training or optimization....
