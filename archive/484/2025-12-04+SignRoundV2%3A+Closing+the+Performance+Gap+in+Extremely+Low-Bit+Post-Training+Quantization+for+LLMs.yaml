summary: The study presents SignRoundV2, a new method to improve the performance of large language models when using extremely low-bit quantization, which is essential for efficient deployment. SignRoundV2 uses a fast sensitivity metric and a lightweight pre-tuning search to allocate bits and improve quantization, closing the gap with full-precision models and achieving competitive accuracy even at 2 bits....
