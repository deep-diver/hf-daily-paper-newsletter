summary: The study proposes ARM-Thinker, a reward model for vision-language systems that uses external tools to verify visual details and reasoning claims, improving upon existing models' limitations. ARM-Thinker is trained with multi-stage reinforcement learning and tested on a new benchmark, ARMBench-VL, showing significant improvements in accuracy and interpretability compared to baselines....
