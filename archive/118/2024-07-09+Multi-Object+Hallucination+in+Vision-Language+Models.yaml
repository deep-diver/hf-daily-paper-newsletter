summary: This paper investigates multi-object hallucination in large vision language models and introduces a new evaluation protocol called Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE). The study finds that LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects and that their hallucination behaviors are influenced by various factors. The researchers hope to improve LVLMs' ability to recognize and reason about multiple objects in realistic visual scenes and to provide insights and quanti...
