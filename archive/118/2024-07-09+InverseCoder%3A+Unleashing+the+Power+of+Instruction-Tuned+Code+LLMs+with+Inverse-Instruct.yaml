summary: This paper introduces INVERSE-INSTRUCT, a method that improves an instruction-tuned code LLM by generating data from itself instead of using closed-source LLMs. It does this by summarizing instructions from code snippets, generating additional high-quality instructions, and fine-tuning the base LLM with the self-generated data. The resulting code LLMs, named InverseCoder, outperform the original code LLMs on various benchmarks....
