summary: The authors present STARFlow-V, a new video generation model based on normalizing flows, which offers benefits like end-to-end learning and native likelihood estimation. This model improves upon its predecessor by using a global-local architecture to manage spatiotemporal complexity and a lightweight causal denoiser to enhance video generation consistency, resulting in strong visual quality and temporal consistency compared to diffusion-based baselines....
