summary: The authors present a new method, Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), for policy optimization in reinforcement learning with large language models. SAPO improves upon existing methods by using a temperature-controlled gate to adaptively attenuate off-policy updates, maintaining sequence-level coherence and token-adaptive learning, leading to better stability and performance in mathematical reasoning benchmarks....
