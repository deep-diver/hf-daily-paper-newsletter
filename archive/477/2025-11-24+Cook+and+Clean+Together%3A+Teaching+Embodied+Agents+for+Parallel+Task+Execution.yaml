summary: This study presents ORS3D, a new challenge for embodied AI that requires agents to understand language, grasp 3D spatial concepts, and optimize task efficiency by performing parallel tasks. The researchers also introduce ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset, and GRANT, a model that can generate efficient task schedules and actions, demonstrating improved performance in these areas compared to existing methods....
