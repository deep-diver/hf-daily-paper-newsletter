summary: This paper proposes a method to enhance the reasoning abilities of small-scale language models through self-training and preference learning. By integrating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into self-training, the models can learn from their own outputs and be guided towards more accurate and diverse chain-of-thought reasoning. The method is evaluated on various mathematical reasoning tasks using different base models, and the results show that it improves LMs' reasoning performance and offe...
