summary: This paper proposes a method to balance the computation and memory usage in large language model training by partitioning vocabulary layers across pipeline devices and reducing activation memory overhead. The method achieves computation and memory balance regardless of vocabulary size, improving throughput and reducing peak memory usage. The implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/VocabularyParallelism ....
