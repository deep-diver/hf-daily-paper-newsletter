summary: This paper introduces RaVL, a method for discovering and mitigating spurious correlations in fine-tuned vision-language models. RaVL takes a fine-grained perspective on model robustness by focusing on local image features rather than the global image level. It uses a region-level clustering approach to identify and mitigate spurious correlations, resulting in improved zero-shot classification accuracy....
