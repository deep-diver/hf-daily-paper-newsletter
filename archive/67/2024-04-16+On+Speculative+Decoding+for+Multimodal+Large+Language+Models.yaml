summary: This paper proposes using speculative decoding to improve the inference efficiency of multimodal large language models, specifically the LLaVA 7B model. They show that a language-only model can serve as a good draft model for speculative decoding, and their experiments show a memory-bound speedup of up to 2.37 times using a smaller language model. They also introduce a compact LLaVA draft model with an image adapter that maintains comparable results in other tasks while showing marginal performa...
