summary: This paper presents Ctrl-Adapter, a framework for adapting pretrained image ControlNets to any image/video diffusion models for controlled generation. Ctrl-Adapter improves temporal alignment and provides diverse capabilities including image/video control, multi-condition control, and video editing. It matches ControlNet for image control and outperforms baselines for video control with lower computational costs....
