summary: The authors present DualTHOR, a simulation platform for complex dual-arm humanoid robots, which includes real-world robot assets, a task suite for dual-arm collaboration, and a contingency mechanism to incorporate potential failures. This platform allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of the robustness and generalization of Vision Language Models in household environments, revealing that current models struggle with dual-arm coordination and exhibit limited robustness in realistic environme...
