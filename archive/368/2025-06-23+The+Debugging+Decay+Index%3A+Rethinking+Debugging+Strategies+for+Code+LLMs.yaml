summary: This study presents the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a framework that measures the decline in debugging effectiveness in AI models, which usually loses 60-80% of its capability in just 2-3 attempts. The research suggests a 'fresh start' approach, shifting from exploration to exploitation at key points in the debugging process, to improve debugging effectiveness and optimize iterative code generation strategies....
