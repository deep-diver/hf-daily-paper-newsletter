summary: This study investigates how to effectively scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual, multi-task setting. The researchers find that existing sampling and selection strategies often fail to generalize across languages and propose novel methods that yield significant improvements in win-rates for multilingual models, particularly for underrepresented languages....
