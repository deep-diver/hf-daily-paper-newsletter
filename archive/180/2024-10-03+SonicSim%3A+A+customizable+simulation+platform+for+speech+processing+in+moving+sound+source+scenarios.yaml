summary: SonicSim is a tool that creates realistic sound simulations for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios. It offers customization at different levels and generates diverse synthetic data. The tool was used to create the SonicSet dataset, which was compared with real-world data and synthetic datasets for speech separation and enhancement. The results show that SonicSim's synthetic data can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios....
