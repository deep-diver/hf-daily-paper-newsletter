summary: EVER is a real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering method that offers accurate results and avoids popping artifacts and view-dependent density issues, unlike 3D Gaussian Splatting. It also supports effects like defocus blur and camera distortion that are hard to achieve with rasterization. EVER is faster than 3D Gaussian Splatting and achieves better accuracy, especially on large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset....
