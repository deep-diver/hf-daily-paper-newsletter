summary: In this paper, we study how to use LoRA in federated learning. We find that certain matrices (A) are used to learn general knowledge while others (B) capture client-specific knowledge. We propose a new method called FedSA-LoRA, which only shares the A matrices for aggregation. We also extend this method to other LoRA variants, showing it's a good way to use LoRA with federated learning....
