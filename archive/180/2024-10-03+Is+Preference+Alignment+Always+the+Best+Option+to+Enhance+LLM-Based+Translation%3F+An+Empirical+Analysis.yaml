summary: This study investigates the impact of preference-based alignment on translation quality using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO). The results show that while CPO outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on high-quality data, it can lead to instability across downstream evaluation metrics and may not always be the best option to enhance LLM-based translation. Additionally, the study finds that using the base model for generating candidate translations achieves comparable performance to usi...
