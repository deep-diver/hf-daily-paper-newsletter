summary: This paper introduces ClinicalBench, a benchmark to study the clinical predictive modeling capacities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and traditional ML models. Through extensive empirical investigation, it is discovered that LLMs still cannot beat traditional ML models in clinical prediction, highlighting potential deficiencies in clinical reasoning and decision-making. ClinicalBench can help bridge the gap between LLM development for healthcare and real-world clinical practice....
