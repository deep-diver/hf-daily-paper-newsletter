summary: This study explores how large language models, primarily trained in English, can reason in other languages. It finds that increasing computation for English-centric models improves their performance in mathematical reasoning across many languages, even low-resource ones. The research also reveals that these models tend to use a 'quote-and-think' pattern when reasoning about non-English inputs, and that they reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. However, the models strugg...
