summary: The researchers created a model called LegoGPT that generates stable and buildable LEGO designs from text prompts. They built a large dataset of LEGO designs with captions, trained a language model to predict the next brick, and used physics laws and assembly constraints to improve design stability. The resulting designs are stable, diverse, and visually appealing, and can be assembled by humans or robots....
