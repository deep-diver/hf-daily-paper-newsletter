summary: The study investigates if reasoning can be applied across different formats and topics, and finds that training a model with general text information allows it to reason effectively in various scenarios. They then created X-Reasoner, a model that uses a two-step process to learn reasoning from text, which can be used in multimodal and out-of-domain situations, even outperforming existing models. Further training on specific text-only data can also improve its performance in specialized domains, ...
