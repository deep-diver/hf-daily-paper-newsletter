summary: This research proposes a new system for generating high-quality 3D scene layouts using visual guidance. They build a library of 3D assets and scenes, use an image generation model to create images from descriptions, parse these images to recover 3D layouts, and optimize the layouts for coherence and accuracy. The result is a significantly improved layout generation method, as demonstrated by user testing....
