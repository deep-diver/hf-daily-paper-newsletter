summary: 'This study presents a new method for creating large-scale, immersive 3D urban scenes using satellite imagery and a diffusion model, which can generate detailed appearances. The proposed framework, Skyfall-GS, allows for real-time exploration and provides better geometry and texture quality than existing approaches, all without the need for expensive 3D annotations. (Easy to understand: Researchers created a way to make detailed 3D city scenes from satellite photos and generated images, allowing ...'
