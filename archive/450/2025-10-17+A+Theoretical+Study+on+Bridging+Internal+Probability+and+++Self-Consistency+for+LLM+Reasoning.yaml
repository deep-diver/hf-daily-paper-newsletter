summary: This study presents a new method called RPC that improves the reasoning performance of large language models during inference by combining the strengths of two dominant paradigms, self-consistency and perplexity, and addressing their limitations through Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. RPC significantly reduces reasoning error and sampling costs while maintaining confidence reliability, as demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and empirical results....
