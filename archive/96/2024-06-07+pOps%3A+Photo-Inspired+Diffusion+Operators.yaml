summary: The paper introduces pOps, a framework that trains specific semantic operators on CLIP image embeddings. These operators are built upon a pretrained Diffusion Prior model and can be tuned to accommodate new input conditions, resulting in a diffusion operator. pOps can learn a variety of photo-inspired operators with distinct semantic meanings, highlighting the semantic diversity and potential of the proposed approach....
