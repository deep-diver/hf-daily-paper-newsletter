summary: VideoTetris is a new framework that allows for complex and dynamic video generation based on text prompts. It uses spatio-temporal compositional diffusion and an enhanced video preprocessing method to improve the consistency of auto-regressive video generation. Experiments show that VideoTetris produces high-quality video results for complex scenarios involving multiple objects and changes in object numbers....
