summary: This paper explores the use of latent diffusion models to reconstruct complex music from EEG data, without the need for manual pre-processing. The study uses the NMED-T dataset and proposes neural embedding-based metrics for evaluation, and also performs song classification based on the generated tracks. The work contributes to the field of neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces....
