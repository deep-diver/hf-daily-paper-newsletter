summary: The authors present EnzyControl, a novel method that provides functional and substrate-specific control for designing enzyme backbones. This approach is built upon a new dataset called EnzyBind and uses a lightweight component called EnzyAdapter to create accurate and functional enzyme structures, achieving better results than baseline models in various metrics....
