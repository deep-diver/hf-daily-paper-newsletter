summary: The study presents OmniX, a unified framework that uses 2D generative models for creating graphics-ready 3D scenes, focusing on panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and materials for realistic virtual worlds. OmniX is efficient, versatile, and can perform various tasks, such as panoramic vision, generation, and completion, using a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset for improved performance....
