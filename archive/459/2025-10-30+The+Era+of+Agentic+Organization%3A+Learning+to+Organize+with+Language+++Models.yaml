summary: This research presents a new approach called AsyncThink, which allows large language models to think asynchronously and collaboratively, solving complex problems more efficiently and accurately. The method involves an organizer assigning tasks to workers, merging their findings, and optimizing the process through reinforcement learning, resulting in faster inference latency and better performance on mathematical reasoning tasks....
