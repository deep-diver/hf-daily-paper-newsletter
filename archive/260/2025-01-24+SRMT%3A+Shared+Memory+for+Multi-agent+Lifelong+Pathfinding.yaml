summary: The paper presents SRMT, a solution to the challenge of predicting agents' behavior in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). SRMT uses shared recurrent memory transformers to enable agents to share information and coordinate their actions, and it outperforms various reinforcement learning baselines, especially under sparse rewards, in a Bottleneck navigation task and is competitive with recent MARL algorithms on POGEMA benchmark tasks....
