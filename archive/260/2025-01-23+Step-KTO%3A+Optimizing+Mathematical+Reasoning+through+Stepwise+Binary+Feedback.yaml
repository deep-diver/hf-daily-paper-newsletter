summary: The presented framework, Step-KTO, is designed to enhance mathematical reasoning in large language models by utilizing both process-level and outcome-level binary feedback. This method encourages models to follow logical progressions, resulting in better final answer accuracy and higher quality intermediate reasoning steps on challenging mathematical benchmarks compared to strong baselines....
