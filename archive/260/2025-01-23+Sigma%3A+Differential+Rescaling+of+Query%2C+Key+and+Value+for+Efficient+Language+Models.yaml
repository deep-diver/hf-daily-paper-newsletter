summary: This research presents Sigma, a specialized large language model for the system domain, featuring a novel DiffQKV attention architecture. Through differential rescaling of Q, K, and V components and augmented Q, Sigma enhances inference efficiency by up to 33.36% in long-context scenarios and achieves competitive performance in general domains, outperforming GPT-4 in the system domain on the new AIMicius benchmark....
