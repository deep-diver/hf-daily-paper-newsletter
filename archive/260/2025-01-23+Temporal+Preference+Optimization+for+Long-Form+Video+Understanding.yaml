summary: The authors present a new method, Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), to improve the ability of video-LMMs to understand time in long-form videos. TPO uses a self-training approach with preference datasets to distinguish between accurate and less accurate temporal responses, significantly enhancing temporal understanding while reducing manual annotation dependency. TPO performs well on three long-form video understanding benchmarks....
