summary: The proposed method, GSTAR, uses 3D Gaussian splatting techniques to handle dynamic scenes that exhibit topology changes such as appearance, disappearance, or splitting of surfaces. By binding Gaussians to mesh faces to represent dynamic objects, it maintains mesh topology for consistent surfaces and adaptively unbinds Gaussians for regions with topology changes, enabling accurate registration and generation of new surfaces based on optimized Gaussians....
