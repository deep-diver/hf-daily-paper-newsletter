summary: This study highlights that machine learning often overlooks the importance of robustness to an uncertain future in an open world, which is crucial for creating truly robust AI. It compares reinforcement learning with biological evolution, noting that despite its progress, RL struggles in open-world situations, while evolution naturally produces robust agents. The paper identifies key assumptions limiting RL's engagement with the unknown and discusses embodying evolutionary mechanisms in algorith...
