summary: SUNDAE is a memory-efficient Gaussian field that uses spectral pruning and neural compensation to reduce memory usage while maintaining rendering quality. It achieves 26.80 PSNR at 145 FPS using 104 MB memory on the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, compared to 25.60 PSNR at 160 FPS using 523 MB memory with the vanilla Gaussian splatting algorithm....
