summary: This research presents a new method called Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER) that helps smaller language models improve their reasoning skills by running multiple processes in parallel and learning from them, even if their verification and refinement capabilities are weak. The method was tested on a specific model and significantly enhanced its performance on a challenging problem benchmark, allowing it to outperform a much larger model through majority voting....
