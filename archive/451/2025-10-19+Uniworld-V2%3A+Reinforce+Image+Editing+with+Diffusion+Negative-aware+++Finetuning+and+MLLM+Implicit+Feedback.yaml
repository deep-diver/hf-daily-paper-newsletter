summary: The research presents Edit-R1, a new framework for image editing that uses policy optimization, which can generalize beyond training data by using Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning and a Multimodal Large Language Model for feedback. This method, named UniWorld-V2, outperforms existing models on various benchmarks and works well with different base models....
