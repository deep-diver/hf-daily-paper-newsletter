summary: The authors propose a new framework called Glyph that converts long texts into images and uses vision-language models to process them, achieving 3-4 times compression and maintaining accuracy comparable to leading language models. This method also speeds up training and processing, and can enable models to handle extremely long texts while benefiting real-world multimodal tasks....
