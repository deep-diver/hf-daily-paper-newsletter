summary: This study presents Nyx, a unified mixed-modal retriever designed for enhancing vision-language generation by retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information. The researchers address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation by proposing an automated pipeline to generate a high-quality mixed-modal dataset and a two-stage training framework for Nyx, which outperforms existing RAG systems in both text-only and mixed-modal scenarios....
