summary: This paper introduces 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3), a new approach to visual
  imitation learning that uses 3D visual representations to improve the learning of
  complex skills in robots. DP3 outperforms baselines in simulations and real robot
  tasks, and demonstrates excellent generalization abilities in diverse aspects....
