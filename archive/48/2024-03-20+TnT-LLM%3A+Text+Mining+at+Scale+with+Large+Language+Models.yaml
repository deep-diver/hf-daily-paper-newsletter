summary: This paper proposes TnT-LLM, a two-phase framework that uses Large Language
  Models (LLMs) to automate the process of label generation and assignment in text
  mining, making it faster and less expensive than traditional methods. The framework
  is applied to the analysis of user intent and conversational domain for Bing Copilot
  and achieves better accuracy and efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines....
