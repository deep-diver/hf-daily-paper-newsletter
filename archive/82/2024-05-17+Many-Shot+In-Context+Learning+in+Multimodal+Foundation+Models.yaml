summary: This paper evaluates the performance of multimodal foundation models for many-shot in-context learning (ICL) across various datasets and tasks. The results show that many-shot ICL leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot ICL, and Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets. The paper also explores the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call and measures ICL data efficiency of the models....
