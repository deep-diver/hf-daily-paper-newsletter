summary: 'Grounding DINO 1.5 is a suite of advanced open-set object detection models developed by IDEA Research. It includes two models: Grounding DINO 1.5 Pro and Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge. The Pro model is designed for stronger generalization and richer semantic understanding, while the Edge model is optimized for faster speed and edge deployment. Both models achieve impressive results on the COCO and LVIS-minival benchmarks, with the Pro model setting new records for open-set object detection and the Edg...'
