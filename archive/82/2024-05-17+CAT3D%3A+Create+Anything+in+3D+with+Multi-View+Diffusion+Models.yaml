summary: CAT3D is a method that uses a multi-view diffusion model to create 3D scenes by simulating real-world capture process. It can generate consistent novel views of a scene and produce 3D representations that can be rendered from any viewpoint in real-time. CAT3D outperforms existing methods for single image and few-view 3D scene creation....
