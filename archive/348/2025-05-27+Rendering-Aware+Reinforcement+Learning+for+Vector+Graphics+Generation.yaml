summary: The study presents a new method called RLRF that uses feedback from rendered SVG outputs to improve the quality of SVG generation in autoregressive vision-language models. By comparing the rendered SVGs to the original images, the model learns to create more accurate, efficient, and detailed SVGs, outperforming traditional supervised fine-tuning....
