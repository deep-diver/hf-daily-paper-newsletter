summary: The authors present a new framework called R1-Searcher++ that trains large language models to effectively use both internal and external knowledge sources. This framework uses a two-step training process, first learning formats and then using reinforcement learning to dynamically acquire knowledge, which leads to improved retrieval-augmented reasoning and outperforms previous methods....
