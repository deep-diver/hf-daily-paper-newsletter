summary: The study presents UI-Genie, a framework that improves mobile GUI agents through a reward model and a self-improving pipeline. The reward model efficiently processes historical context and unifies action-level and task-level rewards, while the self-improvement pipeline enhances both the agent and reward models through exploration and verification in dynamic environments. UI-Genie achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple GUI agent benchmarks and the framework implementation and gener...
