summary: This study presents a new approach called BARL that enhances reflective exploration in large language models (LLMs) during training, allowing them to learn and switch strategies based on outcomes. BARL outperforms traditional methods in both synthetic and mathematical reasoning tasks, improving exploration effectiveness and token efficiency....
