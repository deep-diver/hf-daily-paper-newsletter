summary: The study presents CLEANMOL, a new framework that helps large language models better understand molecular structures encoded in SMILES. By breaking down SMILES parsing into simpler, structured tasks, CLEANMOL improves the models' ability to comprehend molecular structures, leading to better performance on the Mol-Instructions benchmark....
