summary: The authors propose using absolute joint coordinates in global space for text-to-motion generation, which results in higher motion fidelity, better text alignment, and improved scalability compared to existing methods. This approach also enables downstream tasks like text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without requiring additional modifications or costly guidance generation....
