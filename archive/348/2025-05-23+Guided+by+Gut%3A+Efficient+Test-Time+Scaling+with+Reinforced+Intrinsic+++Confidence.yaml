summary: The authors present a new method called Guided by Gut that improves the reasoning ability of large language models without relying on expensive external tools. This approach uses internal signals within the model and a reinforcement learning technique to achieve high accuracy and efficiency, enabling smaller models to perform as well as or better than much larger ones while using significantly less memory and computing power....
