summary: This study explores using open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for repository-level software engineering tasks, introducing Code Graph Models (CGMs) that integrate code graph structures into LLMs. The approach, combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, achieves a top performance on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model, outperforming previous open-source model-based methods....
