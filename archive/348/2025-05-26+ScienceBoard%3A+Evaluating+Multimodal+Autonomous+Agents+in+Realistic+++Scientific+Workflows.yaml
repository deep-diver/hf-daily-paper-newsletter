summary: The authors present ScienceBoard, a platform with a realistic, multi-domain environment and a benchmark of 169 real-world tasks to evaluate the performance of computer-using agents in accelerating complex scientific research tasks. After testing various agents, they found that while some progress has been made, these agents still struggle with complex workflows, achieving only a 15% overall success rate....
