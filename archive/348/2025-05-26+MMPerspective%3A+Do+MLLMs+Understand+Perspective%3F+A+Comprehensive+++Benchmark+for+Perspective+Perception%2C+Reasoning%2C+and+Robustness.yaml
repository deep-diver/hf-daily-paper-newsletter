summary: 'The study presents MMPerspective, a benchmark that tests how well multimodal large language models understand perspective through 10 tasks in three areas: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. The benchmark has 2,711 images and 5,083 questions, and the results show that while models do well on simple tasks, they struggle with more complex ones, and the study identifies ways to improve spatial understanding in these models....'
