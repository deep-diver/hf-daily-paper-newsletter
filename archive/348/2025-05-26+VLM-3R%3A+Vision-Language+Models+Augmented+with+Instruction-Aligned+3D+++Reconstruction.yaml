summary: The study presents VLM-3R, a framework that enhances Vision-Language Models to understand 3D spaces from monocular videos, using a geometry encoder and over 200K instruction tuning pairs, enabling spatial reasoning and embodied understanding. Additionally, the research introduces a new benchmark for evaluating temporal reasoning in evolving spatial relationships, demonstrating VLM-3R's superior accuracy and scalability....
