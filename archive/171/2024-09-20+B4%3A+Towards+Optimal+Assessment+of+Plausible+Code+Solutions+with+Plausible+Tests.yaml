summary: We propose an optimal strategy (B4) to select the best code solution from multiple generated ones using plausible tests. B4 outperforms existing heuristics in selecting code solutions generated by large language models (LLMs) with LLM-generated tests, achieving a relative performance improvement by up to 50% over the strongest heuristic and 246% over the random selection in the most challenging scenarios....
