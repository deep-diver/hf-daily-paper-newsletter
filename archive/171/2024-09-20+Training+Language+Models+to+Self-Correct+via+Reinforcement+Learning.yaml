summary: This paper presents a novel approach, SCoRe, to enhance the self-correction ability of large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning. SCoRe addresses the limitations of previous methods by training the model under its own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to ensure effective self-correction at test time. The approach improves the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks....
