summary: The paper introduces MMSearch-Engine, a pipeline that enables large multimodal models (LMMs) to perform multimodal search tasks. They also introduce MMSearch, a benchmark to evaluate the performance of LMMs in multimodal search. The best results were achieved with GPT-4o, which outperformed a commercial product in an end-to-end task. Error analysis and ablation studies are also conducted to understand the limitations and potential of LMMs in multimodal search....
