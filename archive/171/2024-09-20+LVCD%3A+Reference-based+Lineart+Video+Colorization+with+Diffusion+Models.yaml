summary: The paper introduces a new method for colorizing lineart videos called LVCD. It uses a large-scale pretrained video diffusion model to generate more temporally consistent results and is better equipped to handle large motions. The method includes Sketch-guided ControlNet, Reference Attention, and a novel scheme for sequential sampling. LVCD outperforms previous techniques in terms of frame and video quality, and temporal consistency, and is capable of generating high-quality, long, temporally-co...
