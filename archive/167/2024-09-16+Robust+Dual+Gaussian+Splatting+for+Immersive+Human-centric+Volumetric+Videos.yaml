summary: The paper introduces a new approach called DualGS to improve volumetric video playback for human performances. It uses two types of Gaussians to represent motion and appearance, which reduces redundancy and enhances temporal coherence. The approach also uses compression techniques to store the data efficiently, achieving a compression ratio of up to 120 times with only 350KB of storage per frame. The result is a more immersive and realistic viewing experience on VR headsets....
