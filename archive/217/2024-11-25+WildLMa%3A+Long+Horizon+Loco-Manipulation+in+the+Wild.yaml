summary: 'This paper proposes WildLMa, a system that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks in diverse real-world environments. It consists of three components: a low-level controller for whole-body teleoperation, a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired through imitation learning or heuristics, and a planner that coordinates these skills for long-horizon tasks. WildLMa achieves higher grasping success rates than existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations and can ge...'
