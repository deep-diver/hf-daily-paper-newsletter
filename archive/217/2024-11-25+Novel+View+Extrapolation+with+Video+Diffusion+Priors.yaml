summary: This paper proposes a new method called ViewExtrapolator for generating realistic images of scenes from previously unseen viewpoints. It uses a technique called Stable Video Diffusion to improve the quality of images generated by radiance fields, which are often prone to artifacts.

The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of thei...
