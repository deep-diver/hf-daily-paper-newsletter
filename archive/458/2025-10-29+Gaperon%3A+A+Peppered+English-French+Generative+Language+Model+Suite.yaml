summary: The authors present Gaperon, an open suite of French-English language models, including three sizes trained on large datasets. They investigate the effects of data filtering and contamination on model performance, finding that linguistic quality filtering improves text fluency but hurts benchmark results, while deliberate contamination recovers competitive scores with minimal impact on generation quality. The project promotes transparency and reproducibility in large-scale model training by rele...
