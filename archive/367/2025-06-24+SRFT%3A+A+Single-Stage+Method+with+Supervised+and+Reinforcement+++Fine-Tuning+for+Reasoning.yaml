summary: This study explores the differences between Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks, and proposes a new method called Supervised Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (SRFT) that combines both approaches in a single-stage process, resulting in improved performance on various benchmarks....
