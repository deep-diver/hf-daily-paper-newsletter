summary: The paper investigates the performance gap between online and offline alignment algorithms for large language models. It finds that online methods outperform offline methods and that the performance discrepancy is not solely due to data coverage or quality. The paper also suggests that the unique interplay between discriminative and generative capabilities, influenced by the sampling process, plays a crucial role in AI alignment. The performance difference persists regardless of the loss functio...
