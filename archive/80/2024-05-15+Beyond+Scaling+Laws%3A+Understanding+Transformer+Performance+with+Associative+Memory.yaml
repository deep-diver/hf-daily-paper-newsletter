summary: The paper proposes a new theoretical framework to explain the performance of Transformer models, focusing on the role of memorization and associative memory. They model the behavior of Transformers with Hopfield networks and design an energy function to explain the attention mechanism. They show that the minimum achievable cross-entropy loss is bounded from below by a constant, and validate their results through experiments with GPT-2 and vanilla Transformers....
