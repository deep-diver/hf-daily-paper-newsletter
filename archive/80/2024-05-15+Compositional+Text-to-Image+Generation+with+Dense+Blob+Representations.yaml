summary: This paper proposes a new approach to text-to-image generation that uses modular, human-interpretable, and easy-to-construct visual primitives called dense blob representations. These representations are used to develop a new diffusion model called BlobGEN for compositional generation, which achieves better quality and controllability on MS-COCO. When combined with large language models, BlobGEN exhibits superior numerical and spatial correctness on compositional image generation benchmarks....
