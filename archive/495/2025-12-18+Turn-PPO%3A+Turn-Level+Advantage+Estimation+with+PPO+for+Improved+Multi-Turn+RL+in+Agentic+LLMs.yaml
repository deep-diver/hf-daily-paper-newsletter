summary: This study compares two reinforcement learning algorithms, GRPO and PPO, for training LLM agents in multi-turn tasks, and introduces a new variant called turn-PPO that improves performance by operating on a turn-level MDP formulation. The researchers find turn-PPO to be more effective than GRPO and even the standard PPO for multi-turn tasks, as demonstrated through experiments on WebShop and Sokoban datasets....
