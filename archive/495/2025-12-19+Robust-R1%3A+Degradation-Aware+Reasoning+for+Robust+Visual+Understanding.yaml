summary: The authors present a new framework called Robust-R1 that improves the performance of multimodal large language models in real-world visual tasks by explicitly modeling visual degradations. Robust-R1 uses a specialized dataset with realistic degradations and structured reasoning chains to outperform other models in various challenging visual tasks....
