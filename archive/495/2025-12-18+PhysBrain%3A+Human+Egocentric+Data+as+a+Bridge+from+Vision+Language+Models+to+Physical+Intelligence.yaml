summary: The study presents a method to improve physical intelligence in robots by using large-scale human egocentric videos, which capture interaction context and causal structure. The proposed Egocentric2Embodiment translation pipeline transforms first-person videos into structured supervision, enabling the creation of the E2E-3M dataset. The resulting egocentric-aware embodied brain, PhysBrain, demonstrates better understanding and planning in egocentric scenarios, facilitating more efficient robot co...
