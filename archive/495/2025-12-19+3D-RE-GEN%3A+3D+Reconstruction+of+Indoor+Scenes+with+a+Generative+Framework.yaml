summary: The authors present 3D-RE-GEN, a new framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background, addressing current limitations in 3D scene reconstruction for artists in visual effects and game development. This method uses a combination of state-of-the-art models and a novel optimization technique to produce coherent, modifiable scenes with accurate spatial relationships and a comprehensive background....
