summary: The research proposes a method called StageVAR to improve the efficiency of Visual Autoregressive Models, which generate high-quality images by predicting the next scale. StageVAR identifies that early stages are crucial for maintaining image consistency while later stages mainly refine details. By exploiting this, StageVAR accelerates the generation process by up to 3.4 times without significantly affecting image quality....
