summary: Researchers have developed a new model called UAE-3D to generate 3D molecules, which is crucial for drug discovery and material science. This model compresses molecule data into a single latent space, making it easier to handle complex multi-modalities and maintain 3D coordinate consistency, resulting in better performance in generating new or conditioned 3D molecules....
