summary: The proposed method, Zero-1-to-A, is designed to improve the creation of lifelike avatars using a video diffusion model. By iteratively constructing video datasets and optimizing animatable avatars, Zero-1-to-A ensures a progressive and consistent increase in avatar quality, with experiments showing improvements in fidelity, animation quality, and rendering speed compared to other diffusion-based methods....
