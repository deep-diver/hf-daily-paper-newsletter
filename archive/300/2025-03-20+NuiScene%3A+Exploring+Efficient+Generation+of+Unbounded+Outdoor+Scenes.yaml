summary: The authors propose an efficient method for generating expansive outdoor scenes, using a uniform vector set encoding for better compression and performance compared to prior methods. They train an explicit outpainting model for unbounded generation, which improves coherence and speeds up generation, and introduce NuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes for training and blending different environments within the same scene....
