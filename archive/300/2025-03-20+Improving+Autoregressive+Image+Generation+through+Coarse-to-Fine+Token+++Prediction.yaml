summary: The research introduces a Coarse-to-Fine (CTF) token prediction method to improve autoregressive image generation, addressing the issue of quantization errors in VQ-VAE by exploiting redundancy in large codebooks. This approach outperforms baselines with a 59-point average improvement in Inception Score on ImageNet and maintains faster sampling speeds....
