summary: The paper presents FlashVDM, a framework to speed up both Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Diffusion Inference Time (DiT) in Vecset Diffusion Model (VDM), a 3D shape generation model. FlashVDM achieves this through Progressive Flow Distillation for DiT and a lightning vecset decoder with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical Volume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design for VAE. The proposed methods significantly outperform existing fast 3D generation methods, reducing inference time by over 45x ...
