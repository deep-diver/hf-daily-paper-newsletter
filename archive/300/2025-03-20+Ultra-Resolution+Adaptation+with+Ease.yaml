summary: The paper proposes a method named URAE for high-resolution image generation using text-to-image diffusion models while focusing on data and parameter efficiency. URAE demonstrates that synthetic data from teacher models can improve training convergence, and tuning minor weight components can outperform low-rank adapters for parameter efficiency, achieving comparable 2K-generation performance and setting new benchmarks for 4K-resolution generation with limited data and iterations....
