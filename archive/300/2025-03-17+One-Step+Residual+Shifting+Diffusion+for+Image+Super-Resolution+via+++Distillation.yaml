summary: The proposed method, RSD, is a new distillation technique for the ResShift model, addressing the high computational cost and perceptual detail issues of diffusion-based image super-resolution models. RSD outperforms the teacher model and similar distillation methods, providing competitive perceptual quality and better alignment to the input images, while requiring fewer parameters and GPU memory....
