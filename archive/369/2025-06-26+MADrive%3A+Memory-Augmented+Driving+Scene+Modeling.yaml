summary: This research presents a new framework called MADrive that enhances the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods for autonomous driving environments. By using a large-scale external memory bank, MADrive replaces observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets, allowing for the creation of more realistic and varied driving scenarios....
