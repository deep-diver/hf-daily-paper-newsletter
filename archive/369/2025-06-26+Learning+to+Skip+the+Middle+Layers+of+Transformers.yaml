summary: The authors propose a new architecture for Transformers that dynamically skips some middle layers, using a learned gating mechanism and gated attention to manage information flow. They aimed to reduce computational requirements for simpler tokens and create a multi-level representational hierarchy, but their approach did not outperform dense baselines with fewer layers in terms of compute efficiency at the investigated scales....
