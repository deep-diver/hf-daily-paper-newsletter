summary: The paper proposes a new method for improving the generalization of learning-based RANSAC by simulating noisy conditions during training and enhancing data diversity using Monte Carlo sampling. This method is evaluated on ScanNet and MegaDepth datasets and shows significant improvement in the generalization ability of learning-based RANSAC....
