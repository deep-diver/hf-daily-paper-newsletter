summary: The study identifies challenges in Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) generalizing beyond their training distributions, hypothesizing that current supervised training methods lead to overfitting and poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. The research proposes two test-time refinement strategies to mitigate distribution shifts, significantly reducing errors on out-of-distribution systems, and sets benchmarks for evaluating the next generation of MLFFs....
