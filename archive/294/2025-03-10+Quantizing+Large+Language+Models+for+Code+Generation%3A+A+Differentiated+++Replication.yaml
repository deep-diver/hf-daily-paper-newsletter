summary: This study replicates Wei et al.'s work on reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) for code generation using quantization techniques. They consider more recent, larger code-related LLMs with up to 34B parameters and advanced quantization techniques, revealing a new frontier for LLM quantization at 4-bit precision, which reduces memory footprint by 70% without significant performance loss....
