summary: This research explores the use of reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) for training vision-language model (VLM) agents in complex card games and embodied tasks, and finds that RLVR alone leads to thought collapse in VLMs due to lack of process guidance. The proposed GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework, which includes an automated corrector for evaluating and refining the agent's reasoning at each RL step, significantly improves the performance and generalization...
