summary: SHIC is a method to learn canonical maps without manual supervision using foundation computer vision models like DINO and Stable Diffusion. It reduces the problem of estimating image-to-template correspondences to predicting image-to-image correspondences using features from these models. The method uses non-photorealistic renders of the template to emulate the process of collecting manual annotations and then uses these correspondences to supervise high-quality canonical maps for any object of ...
