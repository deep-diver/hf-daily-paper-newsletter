summary: A new method called motion-textual inversion is introduced to edit video motions using a single motion reference video and a pre-trained image-to-video model. This method preserves the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and allows for high temporal motion granularity. It can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. The method outperforms existing methods in the semantic video ...
