summary: rStar is a self-play mutual reasoning approach that improves the reasoning capabilities of small language models without fine-tuning or superior models, by decoupling reasoning into a self-play mutual generation-discrimination process. It constructs higher quality reasoning trajectories and verifies each trajectory generated by the target model to find mutual consistent ones, which are more likely to be correct. rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems and boosts accuracy for diffe...
