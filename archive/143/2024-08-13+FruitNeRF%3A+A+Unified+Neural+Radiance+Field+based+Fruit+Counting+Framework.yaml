summary: FruitNeRF is a new way to count fruits in 3D using a special computer program called a neural radiance field. It works by taking pictures of fruits and using them to make a 3D model, then counting the fruits in the model. This is different from other methods because it counts the fruits in 3D, which helps avoid double counting and counting the wrong fruits. The method works well on different types of fruits and has been tested on both real and fake data....
