summary: This paper proposes a new video autoencoder that can encode and decode video with high fidelity. It does this by using a lightweight motion compression model and incorporating text guidance to enhance reconstruction quality. The model can also perform image autoencoding and has been evaluated against strong recent baselines, demonstrating superior performance. The project website is https://yzxing87.github.io/vae/....
