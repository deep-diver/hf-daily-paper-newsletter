summary: A recent study on Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) found that sophisticated example selection techniques do not yield significant improvements over a simple random sample selection method. Instead, the challenge of In-Context Learning (ICL) has shifted from selecting the most effective examples to collecting sufficient examples to fill the context window. Data augmentation can improve ICL performance by 5% by filling the context window with more examples....
