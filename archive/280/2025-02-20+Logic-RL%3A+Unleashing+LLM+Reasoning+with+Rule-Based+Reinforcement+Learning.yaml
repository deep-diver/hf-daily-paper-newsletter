summary: The study presents a new method for training large reasoning models using rule-based reinforcement learning, which is inspired by DeepSeek-R1. The training process uses a system prompt, a stringent format reward function, and a straightforward training recipe to achieve stable convergence in solving logic puzzles, resulting in the model developing advanced reasoning skills and generalizing to challenging math benchmarks....
