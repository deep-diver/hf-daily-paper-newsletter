summary: Researchers developed STGG+AL, an active learning approach using a state-of-the-art supervised learning method STGG+, to generate novel molecules with out-of-distribution properties. They validated its effectiveness in designing organic pi-functional materials with high oscillator strength and in the near-infrared range, outperforming existing methods such as reinforcement learning....
