summary: The presented study introduces S*, a hybrid test-time scaling framework that enhances the accuracy and coverage of generated code. By combining parallel scaling with sequential scaling and a novel selection mechanism, S* improves performance across various models, enabling a 3B model to outperform GPT-4o-mini and boosting state-of-the-art reasoning models....
