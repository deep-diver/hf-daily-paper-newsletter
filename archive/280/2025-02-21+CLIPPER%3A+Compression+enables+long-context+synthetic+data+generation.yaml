summary: The study presents CLIPPER, a compression-based method for generating synthetic data for complex long-context reasoning tasks, specifically tailored for narrative claim verification. CLIPPER creates more valid, grounded, and complex claims compared to naive approaches, and is used to construct a dataset of 19K synthetic book claims, which is then used to fine-tune open-weight models, achieving breakthrough results in narrative claim verification and setting a new state-of-the-art for sub-10B mod...
