summary: The paper proposes HippoRAG 2, a novel framework to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models, addressing the limitations of vector retrieval and improving performance on factual, sense-making, and associative memory tasks. It uses a Personalized PageRank algorithm and enhances it with more effective online use of an LLM and deeper passage integration, achieving a 7% improvement in associative memory tasks compared to the state-of-the-art embedding model....
