summary: The study investigates the extent of hallucination in LLMs across 30 languages in a knowledge-intensive long-form question answering task, using a multilingual hallucination detection model and a large-scale study across 6 open-source LLM families. The results reveal that LLMs generate more hallucinated tokens for higher-resource languages, but there's no correlation between length-normalized hallucination rates and language digital representation, and smaller LLMs exhibit larger hallucination r...
