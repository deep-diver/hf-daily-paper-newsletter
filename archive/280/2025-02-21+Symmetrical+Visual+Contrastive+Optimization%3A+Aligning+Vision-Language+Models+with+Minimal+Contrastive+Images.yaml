summary: The proposed method, S-VCO, enhances the visual feedback for VLMs by focusing on fine-grained image details and aligning them with text tokens. This is achieved through a new training objective and a paired image-text dataset, MVC, which challenges the model with hard contrastive cases involving minimal visual contrasts. These improvements lead to better performance in visually-dependent tasks without sacrificing the model's general abilities....
