summary: This study presents a new method for capturing high-speed 4D scenes using regular low FPS cameras. By staggering the start times of cameras, they increase the effective frame rate, achieving up to 200 FPS without needing specialized high-speed cameras. They also introduce a model that fixes artifacts in the reconstruction, improving the overall quality of the high-speed 4D scenes....
