summary: The study presents a new method called ReMoMask to improve the generation of human motion sequences from text descriptions. It addresses problems like limited diversity and inaccuracies in existing models by using innovative techniques such as a momentum text-motion model, spatio-temporal attention, and guidance for better generalization, resulting in more realistic and accurate motion generation....
