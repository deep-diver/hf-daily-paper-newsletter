summary: The study presents a new method called Sparse-dLLM that improves the efficiency of diffusion Large Language Models by selectively removing unimportant data from memory during inference, without requiring any additional training. This approach leads to significant improvements in processing speed and memory usage, making it possible to handle longer contexts and perform better than existing methods....
