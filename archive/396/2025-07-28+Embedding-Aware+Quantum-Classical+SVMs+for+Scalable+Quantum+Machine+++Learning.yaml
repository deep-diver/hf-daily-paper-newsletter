summary: The authors present a new method for Quantum Support Vector Machines that uses a quantum-classical pipeline with class-balanced k-means distillation and pretrained Vision Transformer embeddings. They find that using Vision Transformer embeddings improves accuracy over classical SVMs and reveals a connection between transformer attention and quantum feature spaces, offering a scalable solution for quantum machine learning....
