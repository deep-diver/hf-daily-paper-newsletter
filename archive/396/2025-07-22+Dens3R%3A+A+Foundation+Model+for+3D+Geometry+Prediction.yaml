summary: The authors propose Dens3R, a 3D foundation model for joint geometric dense prediction, which overcomes the limitation of existing methods that can only predict a single geometry quantity. Dens3R uses a two-stage training framework and a lightweight shared encoder-decoder backbone to accurately regress multiple geometric quantities, ensuring consistent geometry perception and supporting geometrically consistent multi-view inference....
