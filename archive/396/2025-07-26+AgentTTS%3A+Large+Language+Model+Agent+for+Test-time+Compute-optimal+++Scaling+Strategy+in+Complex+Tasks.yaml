summary: 'This study explores a new problem: optimizing compute resources for multi-stage complex tasks using large language models, which involves selecting suitable models and allocating budgets per subtask. The proposed AgentTTS framework, inspired by empirical insights, efficiently finds compute-optimal allocations through iterative feedback-driven interactions with the environment, outperforming traditional and other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency and robustness....'
