summary: This paper introduces CrossFormer, a transformer-based policy that can control different robots without needing to manually align their observation or action spaces. By training on a large and diverse dataset of 900K trajectories across 20 different robot embodiments, CrossFormer matches the performance of specialist policies while outperforming the prior state of the art in cross-embodiment learning....
