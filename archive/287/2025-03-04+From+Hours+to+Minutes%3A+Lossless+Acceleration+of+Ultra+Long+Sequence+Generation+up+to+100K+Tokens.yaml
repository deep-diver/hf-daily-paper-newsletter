summary: The study introduces TOKENSWIFT, a new framework to improve the speed of generating ultra-long sequences up to 100K tokens using large language models. TOKENSWIFT reduces the time required for sequence generation by over 3 times, saving hours for ultra-long sequences, and works across different models and architectures....
