summary: The study examines the scaling of data selection methods for instruction-tuning language models, focusing on selecting up to 2.5M samples from pools of up to 5.8M samples and evaluating across 7 diverse tasks. The research finds that a variant of representation-based data selection (RDS+) outperforms more complex methods in all settings tested while being more compute-efficient....
