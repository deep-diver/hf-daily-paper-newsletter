summary: This study explores why some language models improve with reinforcement learning while others don't. It finds that models like Qwen naturally exhibit reasoning behaviors such as verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining, while others, like Llama, lack them. By priming Llama with examples containing these behaviors, it can achieve similar performance to Qwen. Moreover, continued pretraining with filtered data that amplifies reasoning behaviors helps Llama match Qwen's sel...
