summary: The paper proposes SampleMix, a novel sample-wise data mixing strategy for pre-training language models, which addresses the limitations of existing domain-wise methods by considering the quality and diversity of individual samples for global cross-domain sampling. Experiments show that SampleMix outperforms existing domain-based methods, although it requires more training steps to achieve the baseline's performance....
