summary: The proposed Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO) unifies the training of likelihood-based generative models with the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) objective to improve visual generation quality. DDO iteratively finetunes a well-trained model using a learnable target model and a fixed reference model, ultimately surpassing the previous state-of-the-art in visual generation tasks....
