summary: The authors present TruthRL, a reinforcement learning framework that improves the truthfulness of large language models by optimizing for correct answers, reducing hallucinations, and enabling abstention when uncertain. Experiments show that TruthRL significantly outperforms vanilla RL in reducing hallucinations and improving truthfulness, highlighting the importance of a truthfulness-driven learning objective....
