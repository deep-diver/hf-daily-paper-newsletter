summary: The paper presents a new framework called AttnRL for efficient exploration in reasoning models using Process-Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL). AttnRL improves upon existing PSRL methods by branching from positions with high attention scores and employing an adaptive sampling strategy based on problem difficulty and historical batch size, resulting in better performance and efficiency on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks....
