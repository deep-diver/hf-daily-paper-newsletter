summary: The authors present dParallel, a method that improves the parallel decoding process of diffusion large language models (dLLMs) by addressing the bottleneck of sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. This is achieved through certainty-forcing distillation, which reduces the number of decoding steps significantly without compromising performance, as demonstrated by experiments on various benchmarks....
