summary: The authors present a new Large Language Model architecture, Dragon Hatchling (BDH), inspired by scale-free biological networks, which combines strong theoretical foundations, interpretability, and Transformer-like performance. BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, and its working memory during inference relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons, making it a biologically plausible model for speech....
