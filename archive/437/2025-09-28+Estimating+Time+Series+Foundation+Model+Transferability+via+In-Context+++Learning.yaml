summary: The authors present TimeTic, a framework that predicts the performance of time series foundation models after fine-tuning, using in-context learning and tabular foundation models. TimeTic outperforms zero-shot performance as a transferability score, demonstrating strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance on a comprehensive benchmark....
