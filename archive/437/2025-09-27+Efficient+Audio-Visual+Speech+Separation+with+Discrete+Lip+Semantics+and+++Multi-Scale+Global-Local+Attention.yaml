summary: The authors present Dolphin, an efficient method for extracting target speech using visual cues, which significantly reduces computational cost compared to existing methods. Dolphin outperforms state-of-the-art models in separation quality while being more than 2.4 times faster and using over 50% fewer parameters, making it practical for real-world applications....
