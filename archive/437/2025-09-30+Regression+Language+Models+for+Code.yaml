summary: The researchers present a unified Regression Language Model that can predict various outcomes like memory footprint, latency, and accuracy of code written in different programming languages, without relying on heavy and domain-specific feature engineering. This model demonstrates high performance across multiple datasets and tasks, including competitive programming submissions, CodeNet languages, and neural architecture search design spaces....
