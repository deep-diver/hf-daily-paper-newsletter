summary: The authors present a new framework called Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG) that improves the alignment between diffusion-generated images and their input prompts without needing additional data or editing. IMG uses a large language model to detect misalignments, adjusts diffusion features to reduce misalignments, and formulates a trainable objective to realign the image and prompt. The method is more effective than existing ones and can be easily integrated into previous finetuning-based alig...
