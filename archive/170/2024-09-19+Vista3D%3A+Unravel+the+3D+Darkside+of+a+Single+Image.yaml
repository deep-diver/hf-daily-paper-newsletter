summary: Vista3D is a framework that uses a two-phase approach to generate 3D objects from a single image. It first creates an initial geometry using Gaussian Splatting, then refines it with a Signed Distance Function. It also uses a disentangled representation to capture both visible and obscured aspects of objects, and harmonizes gradients from 2D and 3D diffusion priors....
