summary: CoT (chain-of-thought) is a method for eliciting reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). Our analysis shows that CoT gives strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math or logic, with much smaller gains on other types of tasks. On MMLU, directly generating the answer without CoT leads to almost identical accuracy as CoT unless the question or model's response contains an equals sign, indicating symbolic operations and reasoning. CoT can be applied selectively, m...
