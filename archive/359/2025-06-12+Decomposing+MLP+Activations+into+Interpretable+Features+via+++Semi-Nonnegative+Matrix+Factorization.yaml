summary: The study presents a new method to analyze large language models by decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF). This approach improves upon existing techniques by creating interpretable features that are directly linked to the model's computations, and experiments show that it outperforms other methods in causal steering while revealing a hierarchical structure in the model's activation space....
