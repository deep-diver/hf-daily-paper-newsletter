summary: The authors present a new method for faster inference in Large Language Models by using smaller draft models to better predict the importance of tokens and key-value pairs, improving upon existing techniques like key-value cache dropping and prompt compression. They provide two implementations of this method, SpecKV and SpecPC, and demonstrate through experiments that their approach outperforms existing baselines in accuracy while maintaining improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput...
