summary: The authors present UniPre3D, a new method for pre-training 3D point cloud models that can handle any scale or architecture. It predicts Gaussian primitives, uses differentiable Gaussian splatting for rendering, and incorporates 2D features from image models to improve performance. Extensive experiments show its effectiveness across various tasks and models....
