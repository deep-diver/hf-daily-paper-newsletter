summary: Domain2Vec is a new method that breaks down datasets into simpler parts called meta-domains, allowing for the identification of optimal data mixtures for language model training without actual training. This approach improves efficiency and scalability, as demonstrated by achieving similar results on a dataset with less computation and improving downstream performance by an average of 2.83%....
