summary: This study introduces a new method called VerIF, which uses rule-based code verification and a large language model to improve the verification process in reinforcement learning for instruction following. They create a high-quality dataset, VerInstruct, and show that using VerIF for training leads to significant performance improvements and state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks....
