summary: TAPTRv3 is an improved version of TAPTRv2, which is a simple DETR-like framework for tracking any point in real-world videos. TAPTRv3 uses spatial and temporal context to improve feature querying and robustness in long videos. It introduces Context-aware Cross-Attention (CCA) for better spatial feature querying and Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention (VLTA) for better temporal feature querying. TAPTRv3 outperforms TAPTRv2 and achieves state-of-the-art performance on most challenging dataset...
