summary: We present World-consistent Video Diffusion (WVD), a new method that combines explicit 3D supervision with XYZ images and diffusion transformers to generate 3D-consistent videos and images. WVD can handle various tasks like single-image-to-3D generation, multi-view stereo, and camera-controlled video generation, showing strong performance on multiple benchmarks with a single pretrained model....
