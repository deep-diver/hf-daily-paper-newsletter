summary: This paper introduces a new benchmark called OpenING for evaluating the performance of models that can generate interleaved image-text content. This benchmark includes 5,400 high-quality human-annotated instances across 56 real-world tasks and covers a wide range of daily scenarios. The paper also presents a judge model called IntJudge that can evaluate open-ended multimodal generation methods. Experiments on OpenING reveal that current interleaved generation methods still have room for improvem...
