summary: We present VLsI, a new family of VLMs that focuses on efficiency while maintaining accuracy. VLsI uses a unique layer-wise distillation process with intermediate verbalizers to align smaller VLMs with the reasoning processes of larger VLMs, outperforming GPT-4V on ten vision-language benchmarks without scaling or architectural changes....
