summary: This work introduces Switti, a scale-wise transformer for text-to-image generation. Switti improves the convergence and overall performance of existing models by making architectural modifications and proposing a non-AR counterpart that is faster and uses less memory. It also reveals that classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales can be detrimental and disables it to achieve further acceleration and better generation of fine-grained details. Switti outperforms existing text-to-image AR ...
