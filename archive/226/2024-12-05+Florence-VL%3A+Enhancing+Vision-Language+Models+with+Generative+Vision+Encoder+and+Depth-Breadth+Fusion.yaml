summary: Florence-VL is a new family of multimodal large language models that uses a generative vision foundation model called Florence-2 to create more versatile visual representations. The model uses a depth-breath fusion technique to combine visual features from different depths and prompts, and it's trained on a diverse set of open-source datasets. Florence-VL outperforms existing models on various multimodal and vision-centric benchmarks, and the models and training recipe are open-sourced....
