summary: This paper introduces AgoraBench, a benchmark for evaluating language models' ability to generate high-quality synthetic data. By synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, they uncover key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities, including that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability, and that multiple intrinsic features of data quality collectively serve as better indicators. They also...
