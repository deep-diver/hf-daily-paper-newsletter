summary: We developed a new method using a model called VLM to detect and prevent failures in robotic systems. This method forms the tasks as a set of problems to solve with constraints, and uses code generated by the VLM to check for these constraints in real-time. The method also uses small geometric shapes to make the monitoring more accurate and efficient. Tests show that this method is more successful and faster than other methods, and it can be used in real-world settings and with other control sys...
