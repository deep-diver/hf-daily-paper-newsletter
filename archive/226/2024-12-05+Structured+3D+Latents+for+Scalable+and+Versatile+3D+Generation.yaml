summary: We propose a new method for generating 3D assets that can be used in various ways and looks good. The key is a special way of representing 3D information that can be used to create different types of outputs, like radiance fields, 3D shapes, and meshes. This method uses a sparse 3D grid and visual information from a powerful computer vision model to capture both shape and appearance information. Our 3D generation models, called rectified flow transformers, are trained on a large dataset of 500,0...
