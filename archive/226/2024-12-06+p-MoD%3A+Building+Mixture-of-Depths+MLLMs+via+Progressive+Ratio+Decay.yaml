summary: We propose a new method to build more efficient multimodal language models by selectively processing only important vision tokens in each layer, and gradually reducing the number of processed tokens in deeper layers. This approach improves the efficiency and performance of our models, using less computation and storage during inference, and less training time. We validate our approach on two models and 14 benchmarks, and our model performs as well or better than the baseline models with reduced ...
