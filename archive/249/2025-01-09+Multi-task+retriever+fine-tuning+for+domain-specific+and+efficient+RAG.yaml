summary: This paper proposes a method to fine-tune a retriever encoder for domain-specific and efficient RAG applications. The goal is to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. The encoder is instruction fine-tuned on a variety of tasks and shown to generalize to out-of-domain settings and unseen retrieval tasks on real-world enterprise use cases....
