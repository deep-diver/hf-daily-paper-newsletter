summary: The paper proposes a three-module synthesis strategy to enhance chain-of-thought reasoning in multimodal mathematics, resulting in a high-quality instruction fine-tuning dataset called MMathCoT-1M. The trained URSA-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple multimodal mathematical benchmarks. The paper also introduces a data synthesis strategy to enhance the model's verifying capabilities, resulting in the URSA-RM-7B model, which demonstrates excellent out-of-distribution verifyi...
