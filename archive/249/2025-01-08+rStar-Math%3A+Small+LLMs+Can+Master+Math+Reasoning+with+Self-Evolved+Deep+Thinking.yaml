summary: 'We present rStar-Math, a method that uses small language models (SLMs) to perform math reasoning by exercising ''deep thinking'' through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). rStar-Math introduces three innovations to train the SLMs: a novel code-augmented CoT data synthesis method, a novel process reward model training method, and a self-evolution recipe. Through 4 rounds of self-evolution, rStar-Math boosts SLMs'' math reasoning to state-of-the-art levels, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview on the MATH bench...'
