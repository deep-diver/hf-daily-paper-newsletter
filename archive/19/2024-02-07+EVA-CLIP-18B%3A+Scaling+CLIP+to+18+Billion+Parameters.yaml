summary: The paper presents EVA-CLIP-18B, the largest and most powerful open-source
  CLIP model with 18-billion parameters. With a smaller training dataset, it achieves
  a higher zero-shot top-1 accuracy compared to its predecessor and other open-source
  CLIP models, demonstrating the potential of EVA-style weak-to-strong visual model
  scaling....
