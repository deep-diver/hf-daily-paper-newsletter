summary: EscherNet is a new model for generating 3D images from multiple reference
  views. It's scalable and efficient, able to produce over 100 target views simultaneously
  on a single consumer-grade GPU. It also combines single- and multi-image 3D reconstruction
  into a single framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple
  benchmarks....
