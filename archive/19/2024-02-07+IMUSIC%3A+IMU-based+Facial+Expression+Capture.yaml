summary: The paper proposes a new approach for facial expression capture using Inertial
  Measurement Units (IMUs) instead of visual cues. This approach, called IMUSIC, uses
  a set of small IMUs placed on the face and a Transformer diffusion model to accurately
  predict facial expressions. IMUSIC has potential applications in scenarios where
  visual methods fail and for analyzing facial behavior while protecting user privacy.
  The paper also contributes a new IMU-ARKit dataset for evaluation and future researc...
