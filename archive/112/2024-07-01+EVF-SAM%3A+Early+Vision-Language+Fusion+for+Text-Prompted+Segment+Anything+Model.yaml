summary: This paper proposes a new method called EVF-SAM for improving the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) when using text prompts for referring expression segmentation. The method uses early vision-language fusion and a pre-trained vision-language model to generate referring prompts, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO/+/g while reducing nearly 82% of parameters compared to previous SAM methods based on large multimodal models....
