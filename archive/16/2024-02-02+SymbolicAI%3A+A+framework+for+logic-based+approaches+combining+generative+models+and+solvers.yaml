summary: This paper presents SymbolicAI, a versatile and modular framework that combines logic-based approaches with generative models and solvers. SymbolicAI treats large language models as semantic parsers that execute tasks based on both natural and formal language instructions, bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning and generative AI. The framework introduces polymorphic, compositional, and self-referential operations for data stream manipulation, and facilitates the creation and evaluation of e...
