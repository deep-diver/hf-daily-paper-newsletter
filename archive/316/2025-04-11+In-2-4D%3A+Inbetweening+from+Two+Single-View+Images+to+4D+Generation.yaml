summary: The paper presents a method to generate and reconstruct motion in 4D from two single-view images representing the start and end states of an object in motion. The method uses a hierarchical approach with keyframes and smooth fragments, Gaussian Splatting, self-attention, and rigid transformation regularization to create dynamic 3D representations and ensure temporal consistency....
