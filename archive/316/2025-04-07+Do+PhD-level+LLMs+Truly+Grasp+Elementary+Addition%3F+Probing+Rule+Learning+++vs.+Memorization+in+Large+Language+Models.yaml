summary: The study examines whether advanced LLMs understand mathematical principles or just memorize patterns by testing them on simple addition problems. The results show that LLMs struggle when tested using symbolic mappings and exhibit inconsistencies in their performance, suggesting they rely on memorization rather than genuine rule learning....
