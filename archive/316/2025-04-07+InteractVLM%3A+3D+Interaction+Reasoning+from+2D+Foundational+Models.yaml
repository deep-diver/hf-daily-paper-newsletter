summary: InteractVLM is a novel method that uses large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fine-tuned with limited 3D contact data to estimate 3D contact points on human bodies and objects from single in-the-wild images, which is challenging due to occlusions, depth ambiguities, and widely varying object shapes. It introduces a new task called Semantic Human Contact estimation, where human contact predictions are conditioned explicitly on object semantics, enabling richer interaction modeling and outperforming...
