summary: This study introduces a new method called Dynamic DAE Guardrails (DSG), which uses Sparse Autoencoders in a dynamic way to improve machine unlearning. The results show that DSG outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, stability, sequential unlearning, resistance to relearning attacks, data efficiency, and interpretability....
