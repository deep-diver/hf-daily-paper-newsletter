summary: The study introduces Latent Diffusion Autoencoder (LDAE), a new framework for unsupervised learning in medical imaging using the diffusion process in compressed latent representations, improving efficiency and applicability to 3D imaging. LDAE effectively captures meaningful semantic representations, achieves high-quality image generation and reconstruction, and enhances inference throughput, making it a promising framework for medical imaging applications....
