summary: The authors propose a new method called UloRL to improve the reasoning abilities of large language models, particularly when generating ultra-long outputs. They do this by dividing the output into shorter segments and using dynamic masking to prevent issues during training, resulting in faster training and better performance on various tasks compared to a larger model....
