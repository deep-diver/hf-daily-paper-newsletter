summary: The study presents a new framework called ScenePainter to create consistent and immersive 3D view sequences for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction. This framework addresses the problem of semantic drift in generated scenes by aligning the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the current scene comprehension, using a hierarchical graph structure called SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene concepts....
