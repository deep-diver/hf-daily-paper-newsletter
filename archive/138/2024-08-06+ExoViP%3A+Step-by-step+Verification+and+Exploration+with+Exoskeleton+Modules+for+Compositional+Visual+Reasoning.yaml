summary: ExoViP is a method that uses verification modules as 'exoskeletons' to improve compositional visual reasoning by correcting errors in planning and execution stages. It uses a mixture of sub-verifiers to validate predictions and refine the reasoning trace planned by large language models (LLMs), leading to consistent improvements on five compositional reasoning tasks on standard benchmarks....
