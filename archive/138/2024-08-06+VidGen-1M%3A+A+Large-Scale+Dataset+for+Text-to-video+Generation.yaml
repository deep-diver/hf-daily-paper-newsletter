summary: The paper introduces VidGen-1M, a high-quality dataset for training text-to-video models, addressing the current limitations of existing datasets such as low temporal consistency, poor-quality captions, low video quality, and imbalanced data distribution. VidGen-1M is created using a coarse-to-fine curation strategy to ensure high-quality videos and detailed captions. When used to train video generation models, VidGen-1M leads to better experimental results compared to other models....
