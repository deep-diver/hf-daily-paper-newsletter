summary: The authors present POLAR, a multiview registration method that efficiently handles many views and is robust to high levels of degradation and large initial angles. POLAR converts the registration problem into the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder, uses a custom loss to account for degradations, and employs an efficient multistart optimization strategy, outperforming existing methods on both synthetic and real data....
