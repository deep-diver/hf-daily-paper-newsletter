summary: The paper introduces a new method called Prompt Depth Anything that uses a low-cost LiDAR to guide a depth model and achieve accurate metric depth output up to 4K resolution. The method uses a concise prompt fusion design and a scalable data pipeline to overcome training challenges. It sets new state-of-the-arts on ARKitScenes and ScanNet++ datasets and benefits downstream applications like 3D reconstruction and generalized robotic grasping....
