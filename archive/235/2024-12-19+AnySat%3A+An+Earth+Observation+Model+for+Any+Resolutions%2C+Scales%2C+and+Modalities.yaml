summary: The paper introduces AnySat, a versatile Earth observation model that can handle different resolutions, scales, and modalities. It uses a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) and resolution-adaptive spatial encoders to train a single model on diverse data in a self-supervised manner. The model achieves near state-of-the-art results for various environment monitoring tasks....
