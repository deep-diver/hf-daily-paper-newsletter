summary: This paper introduces NOVA, a novel video generation model that combines GPT-style autoregressive modeling with bidirectional modeling within individual frames. NOVA outperforms previous models in terms of data efficiency, inference speed, visual quality, and video fluency, even with a smaller model size (0.6B parameters). It also surpasses state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks with a lower training cost. Additionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended vid...
