summary: The researchers present a new model, Thread Inference Model (TIM), and its runtime, TIMRUN, to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) beyond their context limits. TIM and TIMRUN enable long-horizon reasoning by using reasoning trees instead of linear sequences, allowing for unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference....
