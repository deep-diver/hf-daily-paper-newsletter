summary: The study explores how increasing inference-time computation impacts the robustness of smaller, open-source models, revealing a hidden assumption in prior work. It highlights a security risk where exposing intermediate reasoning steps can reduce model robustness, emphasizing the importance of understanding adversarial settings and deployment contexts for inference-time scaling in real-world applications....
