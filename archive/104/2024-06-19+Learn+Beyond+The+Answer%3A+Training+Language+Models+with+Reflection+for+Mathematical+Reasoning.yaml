summary: We present a new approach called reflective augmentation to improve language models' understanding of mathematical problems by encouraging them to think more deeply and consider different perspectives. Our method enhances performance not only in standard settings but also in more complex scenarios that require reflective thinking. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach and its complementary nature relative to existing augmentation techniques....
