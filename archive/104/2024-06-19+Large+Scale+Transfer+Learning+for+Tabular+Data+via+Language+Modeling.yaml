summary: This paper introduces TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. It uses a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus to fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model for tabular data prediction. The model has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points higher than random guessing, and is more accurate than existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models in the few-shot setting....
