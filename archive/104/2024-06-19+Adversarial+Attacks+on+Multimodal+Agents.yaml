summary: We demonstrate that multimodal agents, which use vision-enabled language models to take actions in real environments, can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Our attacks use adversarial text strings to guide gradient-based perturbation over one trigger image in the environment, and we evaluate these attacks on a set of adversarial tasks based on VisualWebArena. The captioner attack can make a captioner-augmented GPT-4V agent execute adversarial goals with a 75% success rate, while the CLIP att...
