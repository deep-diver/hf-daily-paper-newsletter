summary: HumanSplat is a new method that uses a single image to create a 3D model of a person, even if the image is not from a specific angle. It uses a special kind of computer program called a diffusion model and a transformer to make the 3D model look as real as possible. The program also uses information about the person's body structure to help make the 3D model more accurate. HumanSplat is better than other programs at making 3D models from images, even if the images are not perfect....
