summary: 'This paper proposes a new depth estimation framework for 360-degree imagery by using state-of-the-art perspective depth estimation models as teachers to generate pseudo labels through a six-face cube projection technique. The framework includes two main stages: offline mask generation for invalid regions and an online semi-supervised joint training regime. The proposed training pipeline can enhance any 360 monocular depth estimator and demonstrates effective knowledge transfer across different c...'
