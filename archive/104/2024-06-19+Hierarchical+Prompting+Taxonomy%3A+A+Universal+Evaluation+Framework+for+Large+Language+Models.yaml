summary: The paper introduces a new method called Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) more precisely by using different prompting strategies based on task complexity. This method assigns a score, called the Hierarchical Prompting Score (HP-Score), to datasets and LLMs, providing a clearer perspective on their performance. Additionally, the paper introduces an adaptive framework to automatically select the appropriate prompting strategy for each task. The study c...
