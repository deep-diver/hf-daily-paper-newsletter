summary: The authors present a new, efficient method for training value models on long-context reasoning, which outperforms existing methods by not requiring a fine-grained step definition. Their approach, tested on 2.5 million reasoning traces, significantly improves performance and reduces computational resources for DeepSeek models, achieving parity with o3-mini-medium on four math benchmarks with 64 generations and fewer FLOPs than standard methods....
