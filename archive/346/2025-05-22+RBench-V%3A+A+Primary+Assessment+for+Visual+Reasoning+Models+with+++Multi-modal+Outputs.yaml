summary: The study presents RBench-V, a new benchmark for evaluating visual reasoning abilities of multi-modal models, focusing on their capacity to generate images and use visual aids for problem-solving in areas like math and physics. The authors find that current models, even the best-performing ones, struggle with this task, achieving only 25.8% accuracy compared to human performance of 82.3%....
