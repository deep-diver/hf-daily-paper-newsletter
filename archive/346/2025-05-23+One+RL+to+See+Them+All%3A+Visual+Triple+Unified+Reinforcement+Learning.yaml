summary: The study presents V-Triune, a system that allows vision-language models to learn both reasoning and perception tasks simultaneously. V-Triune's components include data formatting, reward computation, and metric monitoring, with a new Dynamic IoU reward for perception tasks. The resulting Orsta model, trained on a diverse dataset, shows improvements across various tasks and is available for public use....
