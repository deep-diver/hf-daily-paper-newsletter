summary: The authors present a new benchmark called TIME, which tests the temporal reasoning abilities of large language models in real-world scenarios. TIME has 38,522 questions and answers, covering different levels and tasks, and includes various challenges like intensive temporal information and complex social interactions. The benchmark consists of three sub-datasets and is designed to help researchers evaluate and improve the temporal reasoning skills of large language models....
