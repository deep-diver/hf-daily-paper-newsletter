summary: The research presents a new dataset, ScanBot, for precise surface scanning in robotic systems, focusing on industrial laser scanning's sub-millimeter demands. The dataset includes laser scanning trajectories across various objects and tasks, guided by natural language instructions and paired with synchronized visual and robot data. The study also highlights the limitations of existing vision-language action models in generating stable scanning trajectories under fine-grained instructions and rea...
