summary: The authors present a method to transfer reasoning and task-solving abilities from large, expensive language models to smaller, more efficient ones by using retrieval and code tools. They improve the quality of teacher-generated trajectories and enhance test-time robustness, demonstrating that small models can perform as well as larger ones, making practical, tool-using small agents a reality....
