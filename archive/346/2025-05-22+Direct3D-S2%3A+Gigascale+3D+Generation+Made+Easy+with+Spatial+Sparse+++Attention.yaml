summary: The paper presents Direct3D S2, a 3D generation framework that uses sparse volumes and a Spatial Sparse Attention mechanism to create high-quality 3D shapes efficiently. This approach reduces computational costs and allows for training at higher resolutions with fewer GPUs compared to existing methods....
