summary: The authors present Time-R1, a new framework that enhances a moderate-sized language model with comprehensive temporal abilities, including understanding, predicting, and generating creative future scenarios. This framework outperforms much larger models in future event prediction and creative scenario generation tasks, demonstrating that smaller models can achieve superior temporal performance through progressive reinforcement learning fine-tuning....
