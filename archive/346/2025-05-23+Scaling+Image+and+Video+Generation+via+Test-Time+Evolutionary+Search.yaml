summary: This study presents Evolutionary Search (EvoSearch), a new method for improving the scalability of image and video generation models during inference time, without needing extra training or model expansion. EvoSearch uses principles from biological evolution to explore and refine the denoising process, resulting in higher-quality and more diverse outputs compared to existing methods....
