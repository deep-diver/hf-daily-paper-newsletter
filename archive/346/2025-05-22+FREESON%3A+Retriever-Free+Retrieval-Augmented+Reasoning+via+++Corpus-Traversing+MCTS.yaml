summary: The study presents FREESON, a novel framework that allows Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to retrieve relevant information on their own, without relying on separate retrieval models. This approach reduces costs and errors, and the researchers achieve this by introducing CT-MCTS, a specialized version of the MCTS algorithm that enables LRMs to search through the corpus for answer-containing regions. FREESON significantly outperforms other reasoning models on various benchmarks, improving EM and F1 ...
