summary: 'This paper explores the mechanisms behind how large language models represent and regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions. It focuses on two components: entropy neurons and token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons impact the logits by writing onto an unembedding null space, while token frequency neurons adjust each token''s logit based on its frequency, shifting the output distribution. The paper also presents a case study on how entropy neurons manage confidence during induction....'
