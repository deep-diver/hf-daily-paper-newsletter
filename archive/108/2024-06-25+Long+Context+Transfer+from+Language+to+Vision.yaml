summary: This paper proposes a method to enable large multimodal models to understand extremely long videos by extrapolating the context length of the language backbone. The proposed method, called long context transfer, enables models to process up to 2000 frames or over 200K visual tokens without additional complexities. The paper also introduces a new benchmark for evaluating the ability of models to generalize to long contexts in the vision modality and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Video-...
