summary: We propose a new method called semantic entropy probes (SEPs) to detect hallucinations (untrue but plausible statements) in Large Language Models (LLMs). SEPs are cheaper and more reliable than previous methods and can detect hallucinations by estimating the uncertainty in the meaning of a set of model generations. SEPs are easy to train and do not require generating multiple model outputs at test time, making them more practical for real-world use....
