summary: This paper proposes a new method called WARP to balance the trade-off between knowledge loss and reward optimization in RLHF, which aligns large language models (LLMs) by encouraging their generations to have high rewards. WARP merges policies in the weight space at three stages, including using the exponential moving average of the policy as a dynamic anchor in the KL regularization, applying spherical interpolation to merge independently fine-tuned policies into a new enhanced one, and linearl...
