summary: 'This paper introduces VideoHallucer, a benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in large video-language models. VideoHallucer categorizes hallucinations into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic, and evaluates eleven models, finding that they exhibit significant issues with hallucinations and are more adept at detecting facts than identifying hallucinations. The paper also presents a self-PEP framework that improves hallucination resistance across all model architectures....'
