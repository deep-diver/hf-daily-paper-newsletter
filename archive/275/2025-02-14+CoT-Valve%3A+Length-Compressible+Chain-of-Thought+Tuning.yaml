summary: This study introduces a new method, CoT-Valve, to control the length of reasoning chains generated by Chain-of-Thought models. CoT-Valve dynamically reduces inference overhead based on task difficulty by generating varying lengths of reasoning chains. The method shows better performance than prompt-based control, and it can reduce reasoning chains significantly, such as from 741 to 225 tokens on GSM8K with minor performance drop....
