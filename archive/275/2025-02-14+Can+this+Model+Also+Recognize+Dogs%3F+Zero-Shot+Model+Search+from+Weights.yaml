summary: The paper introduces ProbeLog, a method that searches for pretrained classification models recognizing a specific concept like 'Dog' without using model metadata or training data. ProbeLog computes a descriptor for each output dimension by observing its responses on a fixed set of inputs and supports both logit-based and zero-shot text-based retrieval. It also employs a collaborative filtering-based method to reduce encoding costs by 3x and demonstrates high retrieval accuracy in real-world and ...
