summary: The paper discusses a method to improve multimodal multilingual embedding models by synthesizing high-quality datasets. These datasets cover a broad scope, ensure robust cross-modal alignment, and maintain high fidelity. The model trained with these datasets, mmE5, outperforms state-of-the-art models in the MMEB Benchmark and exhibits superior multilingual performance on the XTD benchmark....
