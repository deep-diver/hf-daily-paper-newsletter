summary: The researchers present GG, a transpilation pipeline that uses large language models to translate programs between CISC and RISC architectures, incorporating software testing to ensure accuracy. They demonstrate GG's superior performance compared to the Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, in terms of runtime, energy efficiency, and memory usage, and will make their resources publicly available to advance ISA-level code translation research....
