summary: This research presents a self-supervised learning method that uses vast amounts of internet video data along with minimal robot interaction data to create models for understanding, predicting, and planning physical world actions. The proposed model, V-JEPA 2, excels in motion understanding and human action anticipation, and when combined with a large language model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in video question-answering tasks. Furthermore, the model can be applied to robotic planning ...
