summary: The T2MIR framework addresses challenges in in-context reinforcement learning by incorporating mixture-of-experts architecture into transformer-based models. It uses token-wise and task-wise MoE layers to handle multi-modality and task diversity, and a contrastive learning method to improve task-wise routing. Experiments show that T2MIR significantly improves in-context learning and outperforms various baselines....
