summary: This study explores the connection between entropy, a measure of exploration in reinforcement learning, and exploratory reasoning in language models. The researchers introduce a simple modification to standard reinforcement learning algorithms, which encourages longer and deeper reasoning chains, leading to significant improvements in language model reasoning capabilities....
