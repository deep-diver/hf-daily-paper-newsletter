summary: This study presents a new method for extracting structured information from medical documents using a reinforcement learning framework, which requires only a small number of annotated samples. The method improves performance on medical VIE tasks by ensuring dataset diversity, balancing precision and recall, and enhancing reasoning capabilities, but performance may decrease on tasks dissimilar to medical datasets....
