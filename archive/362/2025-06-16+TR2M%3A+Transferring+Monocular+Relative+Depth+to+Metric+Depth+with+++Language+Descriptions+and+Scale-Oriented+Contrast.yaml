summary: This study proposes TR2M, a framework that uses text descriptions and images to transfer relative depth to metric depth, addressing the scale uncertainty issue in monocular depth estimation. TR2M outperforms existing methods, demonstrating great performance on seen datasets and superior zero-shot capabilities on unseen datasets, with the potential to significantly improve downstream applications....
