summary: The study introduces a new framework called Ambient Diffusion Omni that utilizes low-quality and discarded images to train high-performing diffusion models. By exploiting the spectral power law decay and locality of natural images, the framework achieves state-of-the-art ImageNet FID and significantly improves image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling....
