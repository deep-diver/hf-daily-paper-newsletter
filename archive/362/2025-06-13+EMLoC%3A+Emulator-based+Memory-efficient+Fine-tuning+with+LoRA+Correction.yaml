summary: The authors present a new framework called EMLoC that allows for memory-efficient fine-tuning of large foundation models, making it more accessible for users. EMLoC uses a lightweight emulator and a compensation algorithm to reduce memory usage, and experiments show that it outperforms other methods, even enabling fine-tuning of a 38B model on a single consumer GPU....
