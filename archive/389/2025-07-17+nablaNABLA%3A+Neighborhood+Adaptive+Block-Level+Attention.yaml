summary: The authors present a new method called NABLA that improves the efficiency of video generation tasks using transformer-based architectures. NABLA reduces computational costs while maintaining high-quality generation by adapting to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers, and it can be easily integrated with existing PyTorch tools, resulting in faster training and inference with minimal impact on performance....
