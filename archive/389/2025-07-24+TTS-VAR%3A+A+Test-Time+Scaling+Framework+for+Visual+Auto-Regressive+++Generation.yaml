summary: The authors present TTS-VAR, a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models, which improves the generation process by balancing computational efficiency and exploration capacity. This framework uses clustering-based diversity search at coarse scales and resampling-based potential selection at fine scales, resulting in an 8.7% improvement in GenEval score for the Infinity VAR model....
