summary: The study presents a new framework called LAPO that helps reasoning models understand the right amount of reasoning needed for a problem, improving efficiency and accuracy. This is achieved through a two-stage learning process where models first learn from successful solution lengths and then use this knowledge to adjust their reasoning during inference, leading to up to 40.9% less token usage and 2.3% higher accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks....
