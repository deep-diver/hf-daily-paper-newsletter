summary: This paper shows how generative models trained for image synthesis can be used as tools for visual data mining by finetuning conditional diffusion models to synthesize images from specific datasets and defining a typicality measure on that dataset. This approach has advantages over traditional correspondence-based methods as it scales better and works on diverse datasets, including historical car, face, and large worldwide street-view datasets, as well as an even larger scene dataset. The approa...
