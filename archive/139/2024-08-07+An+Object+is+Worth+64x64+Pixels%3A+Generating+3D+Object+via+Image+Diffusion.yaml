summary: We propose a new method for creating realistic 3D models with UV maps by representing them as 64x64 pixel images called 'Object Images'. This approach simplifies complex 3D shapes and allows us to use image generation models for 3D shape generation. Our method performs well on the ABO dataset and can generate realistic textures for the 3D models....
