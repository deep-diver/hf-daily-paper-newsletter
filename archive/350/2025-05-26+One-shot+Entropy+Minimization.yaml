summary: Researchers trained over 13,000 large language models and discovered that minimizing entropy only needs one unlabeled data point and 10 optimization steps to improve performance as much as or more than using thousands of data points and complex rewards in rule-based reinforcement learning. This surprising finding could lead to a reevaluation of how large language models are trained after their initial training....
