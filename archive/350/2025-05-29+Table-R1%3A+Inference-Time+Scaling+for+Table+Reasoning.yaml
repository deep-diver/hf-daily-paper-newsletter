summary: The study introduces two methods, distillation and reinforcement learning, to improve table reasoning tasks using large language models (LLMs). The proposed models, Table-R1-SFT and Table-R1-Zero, outperform other LLMs like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-R1, even with fewer parameters, and demonstrate strong generalization abilities....
