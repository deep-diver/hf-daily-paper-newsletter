summary: This research presents a unified framework for controlling video generation through trajectory-based inputs, enabling seamless manipulation of camera movement, object motion, and local deformations. The framework outperforms existing methods in tasks like motion brushes, viewpoint changes, and local motion manipulation, offering better controllability and visual quality while being compatible with various video generation models....
