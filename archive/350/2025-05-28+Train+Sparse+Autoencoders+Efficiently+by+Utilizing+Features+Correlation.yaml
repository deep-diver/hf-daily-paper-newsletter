summary: The authors present KronSAE, a new architecture for Sparse Autoencoders that reduces memory and computational demands by decomposing latent representations using the Kronecker product. They also introduce mAND, a differentiable activation function that mimics the binary AND operation, enhancing interpretability and performance in their factorized framework....
