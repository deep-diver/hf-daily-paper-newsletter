summary: This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of existing knowledge unlearning methods for large language models and introduces a new method called MemFlex that targets and unlearns sensitive parameters. The findings suggest that MemFlex is more effective than existing methods in both precise knowledge unlearning and retaining general knowledge. Code and dataset will be made available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowUnDo....
