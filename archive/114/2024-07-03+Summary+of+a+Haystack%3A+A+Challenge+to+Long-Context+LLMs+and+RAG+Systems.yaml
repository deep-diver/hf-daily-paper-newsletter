summary: The paper proposes a new task called 'Summary of a Haystack' (SummHay) to evaluate the performance of long-context LLMs and RAG systems. The task requires systems to process a Haystack of documents and generate a summary for a given query, identifying relevant insights and precisely citing the source documents. The paper evaluates 10 LLMs and 50 RAG systems and finds that SummHay is a challenging task for current systems, as they lag human performance by 10+ points on a Joint Score. The paper al...
