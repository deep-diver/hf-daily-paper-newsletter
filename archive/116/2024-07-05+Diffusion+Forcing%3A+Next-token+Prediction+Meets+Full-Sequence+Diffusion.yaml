summary: This paper introduces Diffusion Forcing, a new training method for diffusion models that combines the strengths of next-token prediction models and full-sequence diffusion models. It offers additional capabilities such as rolling out sequences of continuous tokens like video and new sampling and guiding schemes that lead to improved performance in decision-making and planning tasks. The method also optimizes a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of tokens drawn from th...
