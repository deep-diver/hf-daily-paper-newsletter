summary: This paper introduces a new benchmark called Planetarium to evaluate the ability of language models to generate structured planning languages from natural language descriptions of planning tasks. The benchmark includes a PDDL equivalence algorithm and a dataset of 132,037 text-to-PDDL pairs across 13 different tasks, with varying levels of difficulty. The paper also evaluates several language models and reveals the complexity of the task....
