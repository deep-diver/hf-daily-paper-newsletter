summary: A new method for creating realistic images with different lighting and camera angles from multiple images with different lighting. It uses Gaussian functions to describe how light reflects off different parts of an object and a machine learning model to add additional details like shadows and global illumination. The method is fast and can run in real-time on a regular computer graphics card. It can handle a variety of object types and lighting conditions and produces high-quality results compar...
