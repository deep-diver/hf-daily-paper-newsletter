summary: The proposed LLMtimesMapReduce framework is a training-free method for processing long texts by dividing documents into chunks and using large language models (LLMs) to read them. It addresses the challenge of lost long-range information by using a structured information protocol and an in-context confidence calibration mechanism. Experimental results show that it outperforms other long-context LLMs....
