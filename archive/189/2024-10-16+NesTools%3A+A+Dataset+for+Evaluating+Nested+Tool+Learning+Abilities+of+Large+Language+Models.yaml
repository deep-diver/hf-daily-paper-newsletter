summary: NesTools is a new dataset that evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to use multiple tools in nested orders. This is important because current benchmarks don't have enough relevant data instances for this type of learning. NesTools uses a new method to generate large-scale nested tool calls and is of high quality. It can be used to evaluate the nested tool learning abilities of LLMs and has been tested on 22 LLMs, which shows that they still struggle with complex nested tool lear...
