summary: The paper introduces a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as Generalized Structural-equation Models using the Gumbel-max trick, and develops an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Experiments show that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while highlighting the undesired side effects of commonly used intervention techniques....
