summary: The paper challenges the current understanding of how Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) reduces toxicity in language models. It finds that DPO works by balancing the effects of multiple neuron groups, rather than just dampening the most toxic neurons. The paper also finds that DPO can increase toxicity in some neurons, indicating that it's a complex balancing process....
