summary: This paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instruction-following ability of large language models (LLMs). It also proposes the IOPO alignment method, which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, to improve the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing improvements compared to existing methods....
