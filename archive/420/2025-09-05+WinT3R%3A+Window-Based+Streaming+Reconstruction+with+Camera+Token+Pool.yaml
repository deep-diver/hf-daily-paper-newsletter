summary: The authors propose a new model called WinT3R that can accurately predict camera positions and create high-quality point maps in real-time. Unlike previous methods, WinT3R uses a sliding window technique to improve prediction quality without extra computation and a global camera token pool to enhance pose estimation reliability, all while maintaining efficiency....
