summary: This study presents a new method called Set Block Decoding (SBD) that improves the speed of language model inference by allowing the model to predict multiple future tokens in parallel, without making any changes to the model's architecture or requiring additional training. The method has been shown to reduce the number of forward passes needed for generation by 3-5 times, while maintaining the same level of accuracy as traditional methods....
