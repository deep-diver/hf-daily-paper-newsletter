summary: This paper introduces a new method called Continuous Speculative Decoding to speed up the process of creating images using autoregressive models. They do this by analyzing the output of the model and using a special acceptance criterion. They also introduce two new methods to overcome some of the problems that can occur when using this method. This method is able to speed up the process by 2.33 times while still keeping the quality of the images high....
