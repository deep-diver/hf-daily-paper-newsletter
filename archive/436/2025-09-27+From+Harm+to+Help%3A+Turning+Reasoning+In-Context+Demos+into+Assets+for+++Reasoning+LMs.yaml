summary: The study investigates why reasoning language models sometimes perform worse with few-shot examples than with direct answers and finds that this is due to semantic misguidance and strategy transfer failure. The researchers then introduce Insight-to-Solve (I2S), a method that turns demonstrations into useful insights and improves performance on various benchmarks for both open- and closed-source models....
