summary: The study presents SphereAR, a new method for improving continuous-token autoregressive image generation by addressing the issue of heterogeneous variance in VAE latents. By constraining all AR inputs and outputs to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere, SphereAR stabilizes AR decoding and sets new state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation, outperforming larger baselines....
