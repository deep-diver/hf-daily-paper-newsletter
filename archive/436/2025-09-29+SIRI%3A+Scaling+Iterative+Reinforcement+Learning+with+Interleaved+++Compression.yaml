summary: The paper presents a new method called SIRI that improves the efficiency and accuracy of large reasoning models by alternating between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget during training. This approach reduces redundant thinking patterns and increases reasoning density, resulting in improved performance and reduced token usage on a benchmark task....
