summary: The authors propose a new method for large language model distillation by treating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem, which optimizes task-specific rewards while limiting changes from the teacher model. Through experiments, they show that their approach achieves better constraint satisfaction and reasoning skills without sacrificing task performance, making it a practical and efficient solution for reward-aware distillation in resource-limited environments....
