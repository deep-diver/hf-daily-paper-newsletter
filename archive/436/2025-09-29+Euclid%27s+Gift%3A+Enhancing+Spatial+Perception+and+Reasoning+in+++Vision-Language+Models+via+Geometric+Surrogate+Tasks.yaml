summary: The authors present a new method to improve spatial understanding in vision-language models by training them on a dataset of geometric problems. Their approach, which involves fine-tuning models on 30,000 geometry problems, leads to significant improvements in spatial reasoning benchmarks, with the best model outperforming the previous state-of-the-art model....
