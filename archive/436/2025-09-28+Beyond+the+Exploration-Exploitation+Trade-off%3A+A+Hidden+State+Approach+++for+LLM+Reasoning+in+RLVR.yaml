summary: The study challenges the conventional view of a trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning, suggesting that these processes can be separated and improved together. The researchers introduce a new method called VERL, which enhances both exploration and exploitation simultaneously by using a stable predictive controller, leading to significant accuracy improvements in various language models and reasoning tasks....
