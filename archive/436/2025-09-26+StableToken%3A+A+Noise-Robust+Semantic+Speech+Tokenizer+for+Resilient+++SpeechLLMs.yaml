summary: The study presents a new speech tokenizer called StableToken that is more stable and less sensitive to noise compared to existing tokenizers. It achieves this stability through a multi-branch architecture and a bit-wise voting mechanism, which significantly reduces errors in token sequences under various noise conditions, ultimately improving the robustness of speech-based language models....
