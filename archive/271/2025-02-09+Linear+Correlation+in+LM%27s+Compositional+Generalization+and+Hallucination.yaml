summary: This study reveals that a linear correlation exists in language models (LMs) when composing knowledge, and this correlation is resilient to large-scale fine-tuning. It can serve as a potential indicator of LM generalization, and such correlations can be learned with a single feedforward network and pre-trained vocabulary representations....
