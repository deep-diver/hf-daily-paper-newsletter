summary: To address the challenge of generating PDDL domains with current LLMs due to the lack of training data, the proposed method scales up test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities. This method outperforms o1-mini in generating PDDL domains, achieving over 50% success rate on tasks like generating PDDL domains from natural language descriptions or PDDL problems, without requiring additional training....
