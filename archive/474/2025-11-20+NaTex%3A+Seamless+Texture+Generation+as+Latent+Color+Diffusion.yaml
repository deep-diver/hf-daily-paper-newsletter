summary: NaTex is a new framework for generating textures directly in 3D space, which avoids issues like inpainting and inconsistent colors in previous methods. It uses a novel approach called latent color diffusion, which includes a color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer, to reconstruct and generate textures with precise alignment and strong generalization capabilities....
