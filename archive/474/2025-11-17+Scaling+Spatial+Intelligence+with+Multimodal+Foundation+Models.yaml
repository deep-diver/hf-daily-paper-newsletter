summary: This study improves spatial intelligence in multimodal foundation models by scaling up models like Qwen3-VL and InternVL3 with eight million diverse data samples. The new model, SenseNova-SI, achieves high performance on various spatial intelligence benchmarks and shows promising results in general multimodal understanding, while also addressing potential issues like overfitting and language shortcuts....
