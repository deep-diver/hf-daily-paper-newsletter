summary: This paper proposes ELLA, a method for improving the ability of text-to-image diffusion models to understand complex and lengthy prompts by using powerful large language models. The paper also introduces a new benchmark for evaluating dense prompt following called DPG-Bench and demonstrates the effectiveness of ELLA through various experiments....
