summary: The Convolutional Reconstruction Model (CRM) is a fast, high-fidelity feed-forward
  generative model that uses a convolutional U-Net and Flexicubes to create a high-resolution,
  textured 3D mesh from a single image in just 10 seconds, without any test-time optimization.
  The model leverages the strengths of convolutional layers for pixel-level alignment
  and strong bandwidth to generate a high-quality mesh from sparse 3D data....
