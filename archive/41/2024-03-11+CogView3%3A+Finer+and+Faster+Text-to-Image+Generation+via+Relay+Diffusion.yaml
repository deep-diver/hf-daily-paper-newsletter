summary: The paper presents CogView3, a text-to-image generation framework that uses
  relay diffusion to create low-resolution images and then applies super-resolution.
  It increases computational efficiency and image detail refinement, outperforming
  the current state-of-the-art model by 77.0% in human evaluations while requiring
  less inference time....
