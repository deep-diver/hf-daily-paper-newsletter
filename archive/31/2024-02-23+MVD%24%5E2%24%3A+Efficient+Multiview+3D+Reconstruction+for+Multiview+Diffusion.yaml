summary: MVD$^2$ is a method for efficiently reconstructing 3D models from multiview
  diffusion images. It aggregates image features into a 3D feature volume and decodes
  them into a 3D mesh. MVD$^2$ improves the quality of 3D generation and is fast and
  robust to various MVD methods. It can efficiently decode 3D meshes from multiview
  images within one second....
