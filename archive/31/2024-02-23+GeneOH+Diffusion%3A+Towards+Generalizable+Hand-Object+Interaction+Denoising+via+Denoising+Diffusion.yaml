summary: This paper proposes a novel method called GeneOH Diffusion to denoise hand-object
  interactions by using a contact-centric representation called GeneOH and a domain-generalizable
  denoising scheme. The method shows effectiveness on four benchmarks with significant
  domain variations and has potential for various downstream applications....
