summary: This paper presents a conditional diffusion model called Compose and Conquer (CnC) that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. CnC uses depth disentanglement training and soft guidance to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner, allowing perception of objects at varying depths and versatile composition of localized objects with different global semantics....
