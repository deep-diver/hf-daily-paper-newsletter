summary: This paper presents an empirical study on the performance of asynchronous Local-SGD for training language models. The results show that asynchronous Local-SGD takes more iterations to converge than synchronous Local-SGD but proposes a novel method that utilizes a delayed Nesterov momentum update and adjusts the workers' local training steps based on their computation speed. The proposed method matches the perplexity per update step of synchronous Local-SGD and significantly reduces the wall cloc...
