summary: This paper proposes a technique called ReFT (Reinforced Fine-Tuning) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). ReFT improves upon the typical Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approach by employing reinforcement learning to learn from multiple annotated reasoning paths instead of relying solely on given CoT data. ReFT significantly outperforms SFT and further improvements can be made using inference-time strategies. The technique is effective in improving the generaliz...
