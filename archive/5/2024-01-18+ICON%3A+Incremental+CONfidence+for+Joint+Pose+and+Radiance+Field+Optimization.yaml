summary: The paper presents ICON, an optimization procedure for training Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) from 2D video frames without the requirement for pose initialization. ICON estimates initial guesses for poses based on smooth camera motion and introduces confidence, an adaptive measure of model quality used to reweight gradients. ICON achieves superior performance in CO3D and HO3D datasets versus methods which use SfM pose....
