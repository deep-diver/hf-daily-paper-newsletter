summary: SiT is a family of generative models based on Diffusion Transformers that allows for flexible design choices in generative models built on dynamical transport. By carefully introducing various ingredients, SiT surpasses DiT on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 benchmark with an FID-50K score of 2.06....
