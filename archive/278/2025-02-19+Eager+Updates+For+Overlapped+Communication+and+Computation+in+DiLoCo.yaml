summary: The paper explores methods to improve distributed optimization for training large models across multiple workers, specifically addressing the slowdown caused by blocking at outer optimization steps. It introduces a technique called eager updates, which overlaps communication with computation, allowing the outer optimization step to fully overlap with the inner optimization phase, achieving competitive performance with standard DiLoCo in scenarios with low bandwidth between workers....
