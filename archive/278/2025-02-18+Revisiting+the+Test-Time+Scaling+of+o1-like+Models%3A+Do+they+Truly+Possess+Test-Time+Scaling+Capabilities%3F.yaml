summary: This study explores if o1-like models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities, finding that longer chains of thought (CoTs) do not necessarily improve accuracy and that they often contain more self-revisions, which can negatively impact performance. The paper also compares sequential and parallel scaling strategies and proposes Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel scaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, which significantly improves models' test-time scalabilit...
