summary: The paper presents SafeRoute, a binary router that helps improve efficiency and maintain accuracy in large language models' safety guard models by distinguishing hard examples from easy ones. SafeRoute selectively applies the larger safety guard model to hard data points, and outperforms relevant baselines in experimental results....
