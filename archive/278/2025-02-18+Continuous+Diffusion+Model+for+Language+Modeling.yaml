summary: The authors present a continuous diffusion model for language modeling that leverages the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution, connecting it to discrete diffusion and continuous flow on the statistical manifold. This model outperforms existing discrete diffusion models and approaches the performance of autoregressive models on language modeling benchmarks and other modalities....
