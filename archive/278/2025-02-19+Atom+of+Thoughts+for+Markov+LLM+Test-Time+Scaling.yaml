summary: The proposed Atom of Thoughts (AoT) is a method that improves reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex questions into atomic, self-contained subquestions, similar to memoryless transitions in a Markov process. AoT can be added to existing test-time scaling methods as a plug-in enhancement, and experiments on six benchmarks show its effectiveness as both a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement, outperforming other methods on certain tasks....
