summary: The paper proposes the concept of semantic orientation, which defines object orientations using natural language, and constructs a dataset called OrienText300K to support this. They integrate semantic orientation into a VLM system to enable robots to generate manipulation actions with both positional and orientational constraints, enhancing robotic manipulation capabilities....
