summary: A system for managing and reasoning knowledge in perovskite solar cells research is presented, which includes a domain-specific knowledge graph, two datasets for question-answer pairs and materials science problems, and two large language models for knowledge assistance and scientific reasoning tasks. Results show that this system outperforms existing models in both knowledge retrieval and scientific reasoning tasks....
