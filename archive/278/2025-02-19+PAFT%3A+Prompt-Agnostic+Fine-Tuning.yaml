summary: 'The paper proposes Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that encourages Large Language Models to learn underlying task principles rather than overfitting to specific prompt formulations. This is achieved through a two-stage process: constructing a set of diverse candidate prompts and dynamically sampling prompts during fine-tuning. PAFT demonstrates improved robustness, generalization, and inference speed across various datasets and LLMs....'
