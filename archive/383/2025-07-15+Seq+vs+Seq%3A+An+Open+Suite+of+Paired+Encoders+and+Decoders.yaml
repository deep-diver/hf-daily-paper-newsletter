summary: The study presents the Ettin suite of models, which includes paired encoder-only and decoder-only language models with varying parameters and training data. The results show that encoder-only models perform better in classification and retrieval tasks, while decoder-only models excel in generative tasks, and adapting one type to the other's tasks through continued training is not as effective....
