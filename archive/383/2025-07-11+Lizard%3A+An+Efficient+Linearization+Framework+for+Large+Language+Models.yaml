summary: The researchers present a new framework called Lizard that modifies large language models to handle longer text inputs efficiently by using a subquadratic attention mechanism and a gating module for adaptive memory control. Lizard combines this with a hardware-aware algorithm to speed up training and demonstrates improved performance compared to previous methods in various language modeling tasks....
