summary: The authors present PhysX, a new approach for creating 3D models that consider physical properties, addressing the issue of current 3D models lacking these properties. They introduce PhysXNet, a new 3D dataset with physical annotations, and PhysXGen, a model that generates 3D assets with accurate physical properties, both of which will be made available for future research in generative physical AI....
