summary: This paper proposes a novel approach called STAR that uses text-to-video models to improve real-world video super-resolution by enhancing spatial and temporal quality. It introduces a Local Information Enhancement Module and a Dynamic Frequency Loss to improve details and reduce artifacts, and outperforms existing methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets....
