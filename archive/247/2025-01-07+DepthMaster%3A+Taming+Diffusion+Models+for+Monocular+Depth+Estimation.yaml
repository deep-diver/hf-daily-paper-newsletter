summary: The paper proposes DepthMaster, a single-step diffusion model that improves monocular depth estimation by adapting generative features for discriminative tasks. It uses a Feature Alignment module to mitigate overfitting and a Fourier Enhancement module to balance structure and details. DepthMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance across various datasets....
