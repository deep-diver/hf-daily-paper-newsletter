summary: Dispider is a system that allows for real-time interaction with video LLMs by disentangling perception, decision, and reaction. It tracks the video stream, identifies moments for interaction, and provides detailed responses asynchronously while continuing to monitor the video. This makes it ideal for active real-time interaction with long-duration video streams and maintains strong performance in conventional video QA tasks....
