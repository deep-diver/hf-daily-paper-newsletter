summary: This paper discusses the concept of test-time computing and how it can improve the performance of models in complex reasoning tasks. It traces the concept back to System-1 models and discusses how it can enhance the model's reasoning ability in System-2 models. The paper also highlights the key role of test-time computing in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. Additionally, the paper points out some possible future directions for test-...
