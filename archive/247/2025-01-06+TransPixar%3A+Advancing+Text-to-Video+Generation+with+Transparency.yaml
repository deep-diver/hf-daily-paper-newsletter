summary: TransPixar is a method to generate RGBA videos by extending pretrained video models for RGBA generation while preserving the original RGB capabilities. It uses a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture, incorporating alpha-specific tokens and using LoRA-based fine-tuning to jointly generate RGB and alpha channels with high consistency. This approach effectively generates diverse and consistent RGBA videos, advancing the possibilities for visual effects (VFX) and interactive content creation....
