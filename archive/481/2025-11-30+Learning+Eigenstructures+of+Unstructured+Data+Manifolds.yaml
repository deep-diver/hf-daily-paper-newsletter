summary: The authors present a new method that learns a spectral basis for analyzing shapes and manifolds directly from unstructured data, without the need for traditional methods. This approach, based on optimal-approximation theory, can approximate the Laplacian operator and its eigendecomposition, and works for any dataset without assuming anything about the data manifold....
