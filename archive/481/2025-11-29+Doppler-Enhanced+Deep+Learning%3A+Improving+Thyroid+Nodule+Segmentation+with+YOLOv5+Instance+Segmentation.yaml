summary: This study explores using YOLOv5 algorithms for accurately identifying thyroid nodules in ultrasound images, which could help in creating AI-assisted tools for doctors. They found that adding doppler images, which doctors usually don't use, greatly improves the accuracy of nodule detection, making the process faster and more reliable....
