summary: The study presents Envision, a benchmark for evaluating models that generate multi-image sequences based on textual descriptions, focusing on causal event progression. The researchers introduce Envision-Score, a metric to assess the consistency, realism, and aesthetics of these sequences, and find that unified multimodal models perform better in understanding causal narratives than specialized text-to-image models, but struggle with maintaining spatiotemporal consistency....
