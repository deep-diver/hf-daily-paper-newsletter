title: What about gravity in video generation? Post-Training Newton's Laws with Verifiable Rewards
thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2512.00425
summary: The authors present NewtonRewards, a framework for improving physical realism in video generation. By using measurable proxies from generated videos, such as optical flow for velocity and high-level appearance features for mass, NewtonRewards enforces Newtonian laws of motion, resulting in more realistic and smooth videos compared to existing methods....
