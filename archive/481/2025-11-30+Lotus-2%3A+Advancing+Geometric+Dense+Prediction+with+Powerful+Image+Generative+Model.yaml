summary: 'The study presents Lotus-2, a new framework for predicting geometric properties in images using a powerful image generative model. It consists of two stages: a core predictor that generates coherent structures and a detail sharpener that refines fine-grained geometry, outperforming existing methods with significantly less training data....'
