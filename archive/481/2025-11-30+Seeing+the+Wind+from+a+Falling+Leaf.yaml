summary: This research introduces a new method to understand invisible forces, like wind, by observing moving objects in videos. They created a system that can learn about object shapes, properties, and interactions from videos, allowing it to infer the forces at play. This system has potential uses in creating and editing physics-based videos, helping to connect the fields of computer vision and physics....
