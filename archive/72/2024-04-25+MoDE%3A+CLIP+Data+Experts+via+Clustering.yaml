summary: This paper proposes a new method called MoDE that clusters data to create CLIP data experts, improving performance on zero-shot image classification while reducing training cost. MoDE learns from one data cluster at a time, using fine-grained cluster centers to represent each data expert. It can train data experts asynchronously and be expanded with new experts....
