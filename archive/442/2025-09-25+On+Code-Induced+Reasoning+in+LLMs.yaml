summary: The study explores how different aspects of code impact the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). By constructing parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and applying controlled perturbations, the researchers find that LLMs are more sensitive to structural rather than semantic disruptions, and that appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code....
