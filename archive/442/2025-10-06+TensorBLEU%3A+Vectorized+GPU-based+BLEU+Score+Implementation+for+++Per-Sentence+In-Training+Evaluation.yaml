summary: The authors present a new method called TensorBLEU that significantly speeds up the evaluation of large-scale natural language processing models during training, enabling faster research progress. By using GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation within PyTorch and a memory-efficient mechanism, TensorBLEU offers over 13x speedup on consumer-grade GPUs and over 40x on data-center-class hardware compared to traditional CPU-based methods....
