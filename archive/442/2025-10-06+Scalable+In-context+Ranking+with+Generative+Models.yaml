summary: This study presents a new method called BlockRank that improves the efficiency and effectiveness of In-context Ranking (ICR) in Information Retrieval (IR) by exploiting the attention structure of large language models (LLMs). The method enforces inter-document block sparsity and optimizes query-document block relevance, reducing attention complexity and improving retrieval performance, as demonstrated by experiments on various benchmarks....
