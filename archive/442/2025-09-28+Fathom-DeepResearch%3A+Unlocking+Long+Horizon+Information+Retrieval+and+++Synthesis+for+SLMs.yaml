summary: The study presents Fathom-DeepResearch, a system with two specialized models for agentic applications. The first model, Fathom-Search-4B, is trained for evidence-based investigation using live web search and targeted webpage querying, while the second model, Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, converts search traces into structured reports. This system outperforms existing ones in various reasoning tasks, including open-ended information-seeking tasks....
