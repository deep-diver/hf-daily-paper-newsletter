summary: This study presents a new method to create high-quality 4D shapes from videos by using a framework that combines large-scale pre-trained 3D models and three key components. These components help in accurately capturing the movement and changes in the video without needing to optimize each frame individually, resulting in improved robustness and visual accuracy....
