summary: The authors present Drax, a new framework for automatic speech recognition that uses discrete flow matching to enable efficient parallel decoding. They improve upon previous methods by creating a probability path guided by audio conditions, which reduces errors and improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, making it a promising approach for non-autoregressive ASR....
