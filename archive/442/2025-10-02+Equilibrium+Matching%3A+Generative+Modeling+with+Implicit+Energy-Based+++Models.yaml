summary: The authors present a new generative modeling framework called Equilibrium Matching (EqM) that learns an equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape, unlike traditional diffusion and flow-based models. EqM offers improved generation performance, empirically outperforming other models and theoretically learning the data manifold, while also handling tasks like denoising, OOD detection, and image composition....
