summary: EvolveDirector is a framework that uses advanced models' public APIs to train a base model for text-to-image generation. It uses pre-trained large vision-language models to reduce the required data volume and select the best samples generated by multiple advanced models to learn powerful and balanced abilities. The final model, Edgen, outperforms these advanced models....
