thumbnail: ""
link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.09009
summary: A new method, Semantic Score Distillation Sampling (SemanticSDS), is introduced to improve the expressiveness and accuracy of compositional text-to-3D generation. It uses semantic embeddings and a semantic map to guide the generation process, resulting in improved quality for complex objects and scenes....
