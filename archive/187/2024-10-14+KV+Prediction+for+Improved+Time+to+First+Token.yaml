summary: A new method called KV Prediction is introduced to improve the time to first token in inference with transformer-based language models. It uses a small auxiliary model to process the prompt and produce an approximation of the KV cache used by a base model. This approximated KV cache is then used with the base model for autoregressive generation. The method produces a pareto-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off when compared to baselines, and demonstrates accuracy improvements on TriviaQA and Hu...
