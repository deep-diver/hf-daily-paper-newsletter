summary: This paper introduces VITask, a framework that improves the task-specific performance of VLMs by integrating task-specific models. It uses exemplar prompting, response distribution alignment, and contrastive response tuning to adjust the response distributions of VLMs. VITask outperforms both vanilla instruction-tuned VLMs and TSMs, and offers practical advantages such as flexible TSM integration and robustness to incomplete instructions.
