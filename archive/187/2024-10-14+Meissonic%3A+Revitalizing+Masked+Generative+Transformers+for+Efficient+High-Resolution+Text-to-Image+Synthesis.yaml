summary: Meissonic is a new method for generating high-quality, high-resolution images from text that is faster and more efficient than existing methods. It uses a different approach called masked image modeling (MIM) and makes several improvements to this approach to make it work better. The authors also use high-quality training data and other techniques to improve the quality of the images. They show that their method can generate images that are as good or better than existing methods, and they relea...
