summary: The paper introduces Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), an algorithm that reduces the MSE error in image restoration while maintaining perceptual quality. It does this by first predicting the posterior mean and then using a rectified flow model to transport the result to a high-quality image. The algorithm is theoretically sound and outperforms previous methods in various image restoration tasks....
