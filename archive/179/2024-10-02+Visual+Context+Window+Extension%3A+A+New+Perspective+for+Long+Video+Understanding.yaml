summary: This paper proposes a new approach for long video understanding by extending the visual context window of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and introducing a progressive pooling inference strategy to reduce memory consumption. The method consistently improves performance as the number of video frames increases and outperforms GPT-4o on the MLVU benchmark, even with a smaller model size. Additionally, it reduces memory usage by approximately 45% compared to the baseline without any performance loss....
