summary: A system is presented for quadrupedal mobile manipulation in indoor environments using a front-mounted gripper for object manipulation, a low-level controller trained in simulation for agile skills, and pre-trained vision-language models for semantic understanding and command generation. The system can zero-shot generalize to unseen environments and complete tasks with a 60% success rate....
