summary: 'This paper introduces VideoLISA, a video-based multimodal large language model that uses language instructions to generate consistent segmentation masks in videos. It addresses challenges with temporal understanding and object tracking by integrating a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy and using a specially designed <TRK> token. VideoLISA performs well on diverse video object segmentation tasks and shows potential for image segmentation as well. Code and model will be available at: https://github.c...'
