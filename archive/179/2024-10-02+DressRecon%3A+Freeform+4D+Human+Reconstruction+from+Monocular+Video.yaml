summary: DressRecon is a method to reconstruct human body models from monocular videos, focusing on loose clothing or object interactions. It uses a combination of generic human priors and video-specific deformation, and can extract time-consistent meshes or optimize for interactive rendering. It outperforms prior art in challenging clothing deformations and object interactions....
