summary: The comprehensive benchmark, SURGE, is introduced to investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose surrogate code executors. The study reveals that while LLMs can predict code execution results in specific cases, they have limitations in general-purpose surrogate execution, providing empirical insights into the feasibility of using LLMs as surrogate code executors....
