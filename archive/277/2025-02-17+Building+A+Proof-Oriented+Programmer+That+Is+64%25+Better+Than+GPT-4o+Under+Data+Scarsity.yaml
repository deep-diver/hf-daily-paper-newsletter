summary: The paper introduces a new method to improve language models' performance in proof-oriented programming, which addresses data scarcity by creating synthetic data for training. This method helps the models to both generate and repair proofs for function- and repository-level code, outperforming GPT-4o by 64% relative margin and improving GPT-4o's performance by 54%....
