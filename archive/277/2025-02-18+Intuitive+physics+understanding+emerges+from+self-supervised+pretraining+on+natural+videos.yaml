summary: This study shows that deep neural network models trained for predicting masked regions in natural videos can develop intuitive physics understanding, as evidenced by their performance in violation-of-expectation tasks. This is in contrast to models trained in pixel space or multimodal large language models, suggesting that learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing sensory input is key to acquiring intuitive physics knowledge....
