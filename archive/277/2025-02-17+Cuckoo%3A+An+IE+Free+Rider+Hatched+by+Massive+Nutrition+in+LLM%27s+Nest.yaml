summary: A new information extraction (IE) model called Cuckoo has been developed by leveraging the resources of large language models (LLMs). This model is trained using a new paradigm called next tokens extraction (NTE), which converts LLM's pre-training and post-training data into extractive data and adapts to traditional and complex instruction-following IE tasks under few-shot setting, outperforming existing pre-trained IE models....
