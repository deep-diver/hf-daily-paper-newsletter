summary: 'PhysReason is a new benchmark with 1,200 problems for physics-based reasoning in large language models. Top models struggle with it, especially with hard problems, and there are four main areas where they struggle: applying physics theorems, understanding physics processes, doing calculations, and analyzing physics conditions....'
