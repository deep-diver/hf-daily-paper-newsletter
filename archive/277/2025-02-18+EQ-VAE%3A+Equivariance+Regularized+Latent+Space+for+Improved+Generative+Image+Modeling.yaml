summary: The paper presents EQ-VAE, a regularization technique that encourages equivariance in the latent space of generative models, improving their performance. EQ-VAE simplifies the latent space, enhancing the quality of image synthesis by pre-trained autoencoders, and is compatible with both continuous and discrete autoencoders....
