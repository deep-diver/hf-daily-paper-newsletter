summary: The paper presents Adversarial Data Collection (ADC), a Human-in-the-Loop framework that improves robotic imitation learning by maximizing the informational density of individual demonstrations. ADC collaboratively collects data with a human operator dynamically altering object states and environmental conditions, which results in superior compositional generalization, enhanced robustness, and emergent error recovery capabilities with a smaller dataset....
