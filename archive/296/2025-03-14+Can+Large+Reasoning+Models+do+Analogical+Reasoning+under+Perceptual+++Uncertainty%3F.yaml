summary: This research compares two leading Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek R1, in nonverbal analogical reasoning tasks inspired by human IQ tests, specifically using Raven's progressive matrices. The models are tested on I-RAVEN and its more challenging extension, I-RAVEN-X, which includes perceptual uncertainty by introducing confounding attributes and smoothing attribute value distributions. LRMs show a significant drop in accuracy, while a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abd...
