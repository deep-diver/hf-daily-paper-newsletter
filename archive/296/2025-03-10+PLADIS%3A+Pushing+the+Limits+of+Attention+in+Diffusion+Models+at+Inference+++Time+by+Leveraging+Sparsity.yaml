summary: The paper introduces PLADIS, a method that improves the performance of pre-trained models by using sparse attention in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or neural function evaluations. This approach is compatible with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models, and significantly improves text alignment and human preference in text-to-image diffusion models....
