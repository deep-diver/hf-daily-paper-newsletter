summary: This work addresses the issue of non-uniformly distributed forget sets in machine unlearning, which can lead to performance degradation in dominant groups, affecting fairness. The authors propose a strategy that mitigates this loss using sample distribution reweighting and introduce a method called MIU, which achieves unlearning while reducing performance degradation in dominant groups by minimizing the mutual information between model features and group information....
