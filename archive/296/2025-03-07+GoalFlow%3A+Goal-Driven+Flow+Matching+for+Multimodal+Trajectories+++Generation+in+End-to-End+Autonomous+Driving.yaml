summary: GoalFlow is a proposed end-to-end autonomous driving method that generates high-quality multimodal trajectories by effectively constraining the generative process and resolving the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods. GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a PDMS of 90.3, outperforming other diffusion-policy-based methods with only a single denoising step....
