summary: The paper presents TreeMeshGPT, a novel method using an autoregressive Transformer for artistic mesh generation, which improves mesh quality and reduces training difficulty through a unique Autoregressive Tree Sequencing approach. This method also efficiently represents triangular faces, leading to highly detailed meshes with strong point cloud conditioning and normal orientation consistency....
