summary: The paper proposes a new method called Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM) to accelerate diffusion model sampling, balancing speed and quality by combining distribution and trajectory matching. TDM outperforms existing methods with superior image quality, reduced training costs, and efficient text-to-video diffusion acceleration....
