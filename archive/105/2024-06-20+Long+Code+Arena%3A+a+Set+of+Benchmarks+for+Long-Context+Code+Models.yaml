summary: This academic paper introduces Long Code Arena, a suite of six benchmarks designed to test code processing tasks that require project-wide context. The benchmarks cover various aspects of code processing, including library-based code generation, CI builds repair, project-level code completion, commit message generation, bug localization, and module summarization. The paper provides manually verified datasets, evaluation suites, and open-source baseline solutions based on popular LLMs, making it ...
