summary: The study presents SAFE, a multitask failure detector designed for generalist robot policies like vision-language-action models (VLAs). SAFE learns from VLA internal features to predict task failure likelihood, providing timely alerts for robots to avoid or correct failures in unseen tasks and environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a good balance between accuracy and detection time....
