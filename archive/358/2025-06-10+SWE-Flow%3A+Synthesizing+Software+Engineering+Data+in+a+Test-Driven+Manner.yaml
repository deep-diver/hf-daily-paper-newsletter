summary: The researchers created a new framework called SWE-Flow that automatically generates software engineering data using Test-Driven Development. This framework constructs a graph to capture function interactions and produces partial codebases, unit tests, and code modifications, resulting in a large dataset used to improve the performance of open-source models in TDD-based coding....
