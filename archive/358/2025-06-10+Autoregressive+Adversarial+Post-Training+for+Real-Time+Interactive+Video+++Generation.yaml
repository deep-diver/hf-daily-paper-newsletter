summary: The authors present a new method that transforms a pre-trained video model into a real-time, interactive video generator using a single neural function evaluation. This approach, called autoregressive adversarial post-training, is more efficient for one-step generation and reduces error accumulation during long video generation, enabling real-time video streaming at high resolutions....
