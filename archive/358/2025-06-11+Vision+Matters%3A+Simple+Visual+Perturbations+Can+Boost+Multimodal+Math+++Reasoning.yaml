summary: The study reveals that language-only models can match or outperform multimodal language models in math reasoning when given image captions, suggesting that current multimodal models may not effectively integrate visual information. The researchers propose a simple visual perturbation framework that improves perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic changes or additional training data, leading to consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance....
