summary: The study presents LoongRL, a method that uses reinforcement learning to improve reasoning with large amounts of information. It introduces a technique called KeyChain which transforms simple tasks into challenging ones involving long contexts, encouraging the model to follow a plan, retrieve relevant information, reason, and recheck, all of which enhances its performance in long-context tasks without increasing the cost of training....
