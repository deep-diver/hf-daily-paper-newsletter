summary: 'The authors present AlphaOPT, a self-improving system that helps an LLM learn from limited examples and solver feedback to automate optimization modeling, which is typically hard to automate. This system operates in two phases: reflecting on failed attempts and extracting insights, and refining the applicability conditions of stored insights, all without costly retraining or curated rationales. Experiments show that AlphaOPT improves with more data and outperforms the strongest baseline on the O...'
