summary: The study presents KORE, a method that enhances the knowledge of large multimodal models by adding new information and preserving old data. KORE converts individual knowledge items into structured data for accurate learning and uses a covariance matrix to minimize interference with existing knowledge, improving the model's ability to adapt to new information without forgetting previous data....
