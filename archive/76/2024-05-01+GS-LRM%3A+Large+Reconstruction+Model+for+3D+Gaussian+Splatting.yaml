summary: 'This paper presents GS-LRM, a transformer-based model that can predict high-quality 3D Gaussian primitives from 2-4 posed sparse images in just 0.23 seconds on a single A100 GPU. It can handle scenes with large variations in scale and complexity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both object and scene captures, and has potential applications in downstream 3D generation tasks.
