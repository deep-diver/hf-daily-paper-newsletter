summary: The paper introduces a new algorithm called score-based iterative reconstruction (SIR) that is faster and more efficient than previous methods for 3D generation. The algorithm reduces the number of function evaluations required for each sample and is called MicroDreamer. It applies to various 3D representations and tasks and is 5-20 times faster than previous methods while retaining comparable performance....
