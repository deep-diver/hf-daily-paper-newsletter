summary: KANs, a new type of neural network, are proposed as alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Unlike MLPs, KANs have learnable activation functions on edges instead of fixed activation functions on nodes. KANs have no linear weights and can outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability, making them useful collaborators in mathematics and physics....
