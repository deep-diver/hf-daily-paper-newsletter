summary: This work introduces MotionLCM, a method for real-time controllable motion generation. By building upon the latent diffusion model and incorporating a motion ControlNet, MotionLCM enables the generation of human motions with text and control signals in real-time, improving runtime efficiency and maintaining effective controllability....
