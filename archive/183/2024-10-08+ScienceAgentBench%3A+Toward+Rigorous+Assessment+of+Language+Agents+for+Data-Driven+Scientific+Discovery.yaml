summary: The ScienceAgentBench benchmark is introduced to rigorously assess language agents for data-driven scientific discovery. It includes 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and evaluates agents based on their generated programs, execution results, and costs. The best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge, highlighting the limited capabilities of current language agents in generating code for data-driven ...
