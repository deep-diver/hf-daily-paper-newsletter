summary: Presto! is a method for accelerating music generation using diffusion transformers by reducing both sampling steps and cost per step. It introduces a new score-based distribution matching distillation method and a layer distillation method to improve learning. The combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs with improved diversity and accelerates the base model by 10-18x, making it the fastest high-quality text-to-music method to date....
