summary: The researchers developed Ariadne, a framework using synthetic mazes to test and improve the spatial reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through a difficulty-controlled curriculum. The trained VLMs demonstrated significant improvements in both synthetic and real-world spatial reasoning tasks, confirming the effectiveness of the method in extending the models' capabilities....
