summary: The authors present a new method called NURBGen that creates detailed 3D CAD models from text descriptions, using a special type of curve called NURBS. This method is better than previous ones because it's more accurate and can handle complex shapes, and it's built on a large language model that's been fine-tuned for this task. They also created a new dataset of CAD components with detailed descriptions to help train and test the model....
