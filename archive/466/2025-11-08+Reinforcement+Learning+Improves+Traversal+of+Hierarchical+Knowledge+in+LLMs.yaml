summary: The study finds that reinforcement learning can enhance a language model's ability to navigate and search through hierarchical knowledge, improving its performance on knowledge recall tasks compared to non-RL models. The researchers suggest that this improvement comes from better procedural skills in traversing knowledge hierarchies, rather than acquiring new data, and provide evidence to support this hypothesis....
