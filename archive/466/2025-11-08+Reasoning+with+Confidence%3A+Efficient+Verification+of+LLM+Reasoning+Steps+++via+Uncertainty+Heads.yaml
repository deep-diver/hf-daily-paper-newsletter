summary: The authors present a new, lightweight method for verifying the correctness of reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs) that uses uncertainty quantification heads. This approach is automatic, effective, and requires fewer parameters than existing methods, making it a promising direction for creating scalable and generalizable LLMs....
