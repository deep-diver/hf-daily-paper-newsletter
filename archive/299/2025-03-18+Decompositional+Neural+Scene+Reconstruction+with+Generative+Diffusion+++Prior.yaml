summary: The paper presents DP-Recon, a method for decomposing 3D scenes into individual objects, effectively handling underconstrained and occluded areas by utilizing diffusion priors in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize neural representations. DP-Recon also introduces a visibility-guided approach to adjust SDS loss weights, enhancing both geometry and appearance recovery while remaining faithful to input images, outperforming SOTA methods in extensive experiments....
