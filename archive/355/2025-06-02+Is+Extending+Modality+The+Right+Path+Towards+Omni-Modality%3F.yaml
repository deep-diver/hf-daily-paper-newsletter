summary: The study examines the impact of extending modality for training multimodal models, focusing on whether it hinders core language abilities, if merging models can achieve omni-modality, and if omni-modality extension improves knowledge sharing and generalization. Through experiments, the research analyzes these trade-offs and offers insights into achieving true omni-modality with current methods....
