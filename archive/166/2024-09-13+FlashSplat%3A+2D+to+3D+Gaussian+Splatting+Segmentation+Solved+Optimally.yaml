summary: This study introduces a method for accurately segmenting 3D Gaussian Splatting from 2D masks, which is faster and more accurate than existing methods. The key insight is that the rendering of 2D masks is a linear function with respect to the labels of each Gaussian, allowing for a globally optimal solution to be found via linear programming in closed form. This method is robust against noises and completes within 30 seconds, about 50 times faster than the best existing methods....
