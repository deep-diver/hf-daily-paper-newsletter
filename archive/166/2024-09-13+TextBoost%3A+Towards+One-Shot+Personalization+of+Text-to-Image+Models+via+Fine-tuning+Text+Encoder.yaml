summary: This paper proposes a method to improve the performance of text-to-image models by fine-tuning the text encoder and introducing techniques to enhance personalization, such as augmentation tokens, knowledge-preservation loss, and SNR-weighted sampling. The goal is to generate high-quality, diverse images using only a single reference image while reducing memory and storage requirements....
