summary: The paper explores the use of generative models trained on large-scale open-set data to synthesize out-of-distribution (OOD) samples and enhance OOD object detection. The researchers introduce SyncOOD, a data curation method that leverages the capabilities of large foundation models to extract meaningful OOD data from text-to-image generative models. The synthetic OOD samples are then used to augment the training of a lightweight OOD detector, resulting in improved ID/OOD decision boundaries. Ex...
