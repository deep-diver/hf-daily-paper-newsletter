summary: This paper presents a SYCL implementation of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) optimized for Intel Data Center GPU Max 1550. It increases performance by minimizing slow global memory accesses and maximizing data reuse within the register file and shared local memory, resulting in improved performance for inference. The implementation outperforms a similar CUDA implementation and showcases efficiency in image compression, Neural Radiance Fields, and Physics-Informed Machine Learning. The code is ava...
