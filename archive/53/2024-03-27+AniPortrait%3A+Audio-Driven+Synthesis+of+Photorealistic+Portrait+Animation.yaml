summary: This paper proposes AniPortrait, a framework that creates realistic animated portraits using audio and a reference image. It first extracts facial landmarks from audio and then uses a diffusion model to generate high-quality animations. The results show that AniPortrait produces more natural and diverse animations than existing methods. It also has potential applications in facial motion editing and face reenactment. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/scutzzj/AniPortr...
