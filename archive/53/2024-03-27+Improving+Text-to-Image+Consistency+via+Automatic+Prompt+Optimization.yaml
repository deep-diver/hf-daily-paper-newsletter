summary: This paper introduces OPT2I, a framework that uses a large language model to improve the consistency between input prompts and generated images in text-to-image generative models. OPT2I does this by iteratively generating revised prompts to maximize a consistency score, resulting in improved consistency while maintaining image quality and diversity....
