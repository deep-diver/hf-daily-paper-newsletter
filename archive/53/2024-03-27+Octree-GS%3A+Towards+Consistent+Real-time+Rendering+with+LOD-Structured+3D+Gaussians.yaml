summary: This paper introduces Octree-GS, a new approach for rendering 3D scenes with consistent real-time performance. It uses an LOD-structured 3D Gaussian approach, which dynamically selects the appropriate level of detail from a set of multi-resolution anchor points, to improve rendering speed while maintaining high-fidelity results....
