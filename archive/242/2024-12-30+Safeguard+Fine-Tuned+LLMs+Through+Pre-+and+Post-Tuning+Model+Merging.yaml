summary: The paper introduces a method to improve downstream task performance in safety-aligned LLMs without relying on additional safety data. This method involves merging the weights of pre- and post-fine-tuned safety-aligned models, which helps maintain the safety of LLMs while enhancing their performance. The approach is effective in mitigating safety degradation and offers a practical solution for adapting safety-aligned LLMs....
