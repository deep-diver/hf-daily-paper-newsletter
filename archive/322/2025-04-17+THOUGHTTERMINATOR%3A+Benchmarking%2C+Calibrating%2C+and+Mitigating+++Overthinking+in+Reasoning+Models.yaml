summary: This study examines reasoning models' tendency to overthink problems, generating unnecessary responses. The researchers propose new measures for problem difficulty, demonstrate a correlation between difficulty and optimal responses, and evaluate various models' efficiency in allocating tokens. They find that models are generally poorly calibrated, especially for easy problems, and introduce a new dataset and a decoding technique to improve calibration....
