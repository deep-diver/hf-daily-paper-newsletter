summary: This study introduces a novel method for creating anamorphic images that can be understood even when viewed directly, using a technique called Laplacian Pyramid Warping. This technique allows for high-quality visuals and extends the concept of Visual Anagrams to a wider range of spatial transforms, resulting in new generative perceptual illusions....
