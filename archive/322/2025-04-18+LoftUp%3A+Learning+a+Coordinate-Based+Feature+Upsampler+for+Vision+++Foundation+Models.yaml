summary: The authors propose a new method called LoftUp to improve feature upsampling in vision foundation models. They introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer for the upsampler architecture and a new training objective using class-agnostic masks and self-distillation. LoftUp outperforms existing techniques in capturing fine-grained details and adapting to various input and feature resolutions....
