summary: Quicksviewer, a new video understanding model, dynamically compresses videos based on their temporal density, reducing redundancy by 45 times and enabling efficient training with large receptive fields. It outperforms fixed-partitioning baselines in accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on Video-MME, even using up to 5% fewer tokens per frame....
