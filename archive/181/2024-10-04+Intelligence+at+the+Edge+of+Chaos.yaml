summary: The paper investigates how the complexity of rule-based systems affects the performance of models trained to predict these rules, focusing on elementary cellular automata. It finds that models trained on more complex rules exhibit greater intelligence in downstream tasks, with a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. The authors suggest that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity....
