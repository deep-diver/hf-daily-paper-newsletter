summary: The paper proposes two methods to improve document embeddings for retrieval tasks by considering the context of neighboring documents. The first method uses a contrastive learning objective that incorporates neighboring documents into the loss function, while the second method uses a new architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods outperform biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounce...
