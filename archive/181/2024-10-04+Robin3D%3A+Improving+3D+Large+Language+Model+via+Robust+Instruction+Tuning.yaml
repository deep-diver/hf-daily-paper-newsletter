summary: This paper introduces Robin3D, a powerful 3D Large Language Model trained on large-scale instruction-following data generated by a novel data engine called Robust Instruction Generation (RIG) engine. Robin3D outperforms previous methods across five widely-used 3D multimodal learning benchmarks without the need for task-specific fine-tuning....
