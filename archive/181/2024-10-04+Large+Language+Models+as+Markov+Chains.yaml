summary: This paper explores the relationship between large language models and Markov chains, providing insights into their performance and generalization. It derives findings related to the inference power of language models, their speed of convergence, and the influence of temperature on these factors. The paper also presents pre-training and in-context generalization bounds and supports its theoretical guarantees with experiments on recent language models....
