summary: We propose a new 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization method that improves novel view synthesis by introducing a multi-view training strategy and cross-intrinsic guidance scheme. Our method also includes a cross-ray densification strategy and a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy to enhance the effect of densification in distinct views, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy....
