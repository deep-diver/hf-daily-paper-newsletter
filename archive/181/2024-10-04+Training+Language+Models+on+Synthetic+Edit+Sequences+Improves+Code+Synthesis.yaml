summary: By generating synthetic edit sequences using LintSeq, we can improve code synthesis performance of large language models (LLMs) by instruction finetuning, resulting in better benchmark coverage and diverse program generation. Our tiny LM finetuned on synthetic edit sequences matches or outperforms models with twice as many parameters for code synthesis tasks....
