summary: This paper introduces GeFF, a neural feature field that acts as a unified representation for both navigation and manipulation in mobile robots. It uses generative novel view synthesis for pre-training and aligns the resulting scene priors with natural language via CLIP feature distillation. The approach is demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot and evaluated for generalization and real-time performance in dynamic scenes....
