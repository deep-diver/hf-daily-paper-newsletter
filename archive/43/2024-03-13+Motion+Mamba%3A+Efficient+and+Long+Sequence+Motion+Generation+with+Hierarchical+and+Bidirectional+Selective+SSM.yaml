summary: This paper proposes Motion Mamba, a simple and efficient approach for long-sequence
  and efficient motion generation using state space models (SSMs). The method utilizes
  a Hierarchical Temporal Mamba (HTM) block and a Bidirectional Spatial Mamba (BSM)
  block to process temporal and spatial data, respectively, resulting in improved
  motion modeling and real-time human motion generation....
