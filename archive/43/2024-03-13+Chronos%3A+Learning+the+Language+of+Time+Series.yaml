summary: The paper introduces Chronos, a framework for pretrained probabilistic time series models. By training existing transformer-based language model architectures on tokenized time series, Chronos models significantly outperform other methods on training datasets and have comparable or superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, simplifying forecasting pipelines....
