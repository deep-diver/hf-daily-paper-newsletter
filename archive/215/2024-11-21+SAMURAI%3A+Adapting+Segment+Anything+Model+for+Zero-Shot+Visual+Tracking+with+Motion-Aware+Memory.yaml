summary: SAMURAI is an improved version of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) specifically designed for visual object tracking. It uses temporal motion cues and a motion-aware memory selection mechanism to predict object motion and refine mask selection, achieving robust, accurate tracking without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. SAMURAI operates in real-time and demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across diverse benchmark datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize without fine-tuning....
