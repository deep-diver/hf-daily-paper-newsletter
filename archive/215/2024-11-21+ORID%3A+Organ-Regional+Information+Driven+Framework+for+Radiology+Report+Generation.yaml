summary: This paper introduces an ORID framework to improve the accuracy of radiology report generation by integrating multi-modal information and reducing the influence of noise from unrelated organs. The framework includes an organ-based cross-modal fusion module and an organ importance coefficient analysis module that uses Graph Neural Network (GNN) to examine the interconnections of cross-modal information of each organ region. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art me...
