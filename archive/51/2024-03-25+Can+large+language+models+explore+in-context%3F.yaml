summary: This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit exploration capabilities in decision making environments without training interventions. The results show that LLMs do not robustly engage in exploration without substantial interventions, such as chain-of-thought reasoning and external summarization. These findings suggest that non-trivial algorithmic interventions may be required to empower LLM-based decision making agents in complex settings....
