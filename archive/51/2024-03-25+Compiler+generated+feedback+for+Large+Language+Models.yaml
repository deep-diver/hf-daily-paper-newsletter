summary: This paper proposes a new method for optimizing LLVM assembly using large language models (LLMs) and compiler feedback. The model takes unoptimized LLVM IR as input and produces optimized IR, optimization passes, and instruction counts. Feedback from compiling the code is provided to the LLM to optimize again, resulting in a 0.53% improvement over the original model....
