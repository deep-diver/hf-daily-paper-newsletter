summary: This study proposes a method that uses a 3D human model within a latent diffusion framework to improve the accuracy of human image animation. The method uses a unified representation of body shape and pose, and incorporates depth images, normal maps, and skeleton-based motion guidance to enrich the latent diffusion model. Experimental evaluations show that the method is effective in generating high-quality human animations with accurate pose and shape variations....
