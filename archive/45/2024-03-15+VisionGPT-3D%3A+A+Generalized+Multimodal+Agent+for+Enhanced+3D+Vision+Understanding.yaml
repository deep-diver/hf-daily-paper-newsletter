summary: This paper proposes a unified framework called VisionGPT-3D, which consolidates
  state-of-the-art vision models and algorithms to facilitate the development of vision-oriented
  AI. VisionGPT-3D provides a versatile multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates
  various SOTA vision models and automates the selection of suitable 3D mesh creation
  algorithms, generating optimal results based on diverse multimodal inputs such as
  text prompts....
