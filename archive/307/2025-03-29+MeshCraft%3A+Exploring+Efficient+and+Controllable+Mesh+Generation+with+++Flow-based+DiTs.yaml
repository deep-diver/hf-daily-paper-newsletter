summary: MeshCraft is a new framework for efficient and controllable mesh generation that utilizes continuous spatial diffusion to generate discrete triangle faces, addressing limitations of slow generation speeds and uncontrollable number of mesh faces in previous methods like MeshGPT. It consists of a transformer-based VAE for encoding and decoding raw meshes into continuous face-level tokens and a flow-based diffusion transformer conditioned on the number of faces for generating high-quality 3D meshes...
