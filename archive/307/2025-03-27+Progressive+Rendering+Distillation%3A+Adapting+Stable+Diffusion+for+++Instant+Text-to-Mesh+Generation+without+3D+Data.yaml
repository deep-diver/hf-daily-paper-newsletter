summary: The authors propose Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), a novel training scheme to adapt Stable Diffusion into a 3D generator without 3D ground-truths, using multi-view diffusion models for distillation. PRD is used to train a Triplane generator, TriplaneTurbo, which improves efficiency and quality, producing high-quality 3D meshes in 1.2 seconds....
