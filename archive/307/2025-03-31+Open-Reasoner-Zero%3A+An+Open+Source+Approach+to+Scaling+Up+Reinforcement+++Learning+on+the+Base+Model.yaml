summary: The presented paper outlines an open source project, Open-Reasoner-Zero, which employs a minimalist approach to scaling up reinforcement learning training using PPO with GAE and rule-based rewards. With the same base model as DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B, it outperforms the mentioned pipeline on AIME2024, MATH500, and the GPQA Diamond benchmark, while requiring only a tenth of the training steps....
