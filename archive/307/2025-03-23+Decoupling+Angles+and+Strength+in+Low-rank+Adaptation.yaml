summary: Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA) is a new fine-tuning method that enhances robustness without compromising performance. It does this by normalizing and scaling learnable low-rank matrices, decoupling the angular learning from the adaptation strength, and bounding the distance of the transformation....
