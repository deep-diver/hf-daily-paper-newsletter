summary: The paper demonstrates a method to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating correct plans, even for complex tasks. By asking an LLM to generate Python code for heuristic functions specific to a domain, and then evaluating and selecting the strongest one, these LLM-generated heuristics can solve more unseen tasks than existing state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics, and sometimes even compete with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning....
