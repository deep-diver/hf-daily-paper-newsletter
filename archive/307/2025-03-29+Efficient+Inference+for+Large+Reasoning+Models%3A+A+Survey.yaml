summary: 'This survey focuses on efficient inference methods for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which improve reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but suffer from inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. The methods are divided into two main categories: explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and implicit latent CoT, with strengths, weaknesses, and empirical analyses discussed, and open challenges identified such as human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-o...'
