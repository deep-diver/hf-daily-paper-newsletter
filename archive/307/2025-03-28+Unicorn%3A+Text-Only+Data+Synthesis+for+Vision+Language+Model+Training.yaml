summary: 'The paper presents a framework to synthesize multimodal training data for vision language models (VLMs) using only text. The framework consists of three stages: synthesizing diverse captions, creating instruction-tuning tasks, and converting textual representations to visual ones. This results in two datasets, Unicorn-1.2M and Unicorn-471K-Instruction, which can be used for pretraining and instruction-tuning VLMs respectively, without relying on real images....'
