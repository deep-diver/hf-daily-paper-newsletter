summary: This paper introduces DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark that assesses the mathematical reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The benchmark evaluates the models' performance under different variants of the same question and reveals that their accuracy can be significantly lower than expected, highlighting the need for more robust models....
