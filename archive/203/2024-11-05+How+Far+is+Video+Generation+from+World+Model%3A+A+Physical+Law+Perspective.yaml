summary: Researchers evaluate video generation models' ability to adhere to physical laws by analyzing their performance across different scenarios. They find that although these models can generalize within the distribution, they fail to uncover fundamental physical laws and instead exhibit case-based generalization behavior. Scaling alone is insufficient for these models to discover physical laws, indicating the need for further research in this area....
