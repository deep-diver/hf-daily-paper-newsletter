summary: The paper proposes a method called Adaptive Caching (AdaCache) to speed up video generation using Diffusion Transformers. It caches computations and adjusts the caching schedule for each video, and also uses Motion Regularization (MoReg) to control compute allocation based on motion content. This results in significant inference speedups without sacrificing video quality....
