summary: We present Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), a new method for understanding rare and important concepts in foundation models. SSAEs are trained using dense retrieval and Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization, and they outperform general-purpose Sparse Autoencoders on standard metrics. We demonstrate the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs improve worst-group classification accuracy by 12.5%....
