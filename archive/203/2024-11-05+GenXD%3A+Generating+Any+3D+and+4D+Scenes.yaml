summary: This paper introduces a new method for generating 3D and 4D scenes called GenXD. It uses a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos and introduces a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset called CamVid-30K. GenXD can produce any 3D or 4D scene and has multiview-temporal modules that disentangle camera and object movements. It also uses masked latent conditions to support various conditioning views and can generate videos that follow the camera traject...
