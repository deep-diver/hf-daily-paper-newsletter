summary: LibMoE is a library that makes it easier for researchers to study and compare different MoE algorithms in large language models. It provides a standardized training and evaluation pipeline, and allows researchers to benchmark different MoE algorithms across a range of tasks. The results show that all MoE algorithms perform roughly similar when averaged across a wide range of tasks, and LibMoE will be useful for researchers to make progress in this field....
