summary: The researchers present a new method called Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) that improves large language models' performance by dynamically adjusting intervention strength based on both the question and generated content, and correcting deviations through a backtracking mechanism. Experiments show that FASB outperforms existing methods on various datasets....
