summary: The authors present UltraMemV2, a memory-layer architecture that matches the performance of 8-expert Mixture of Experts models with fewer memory accesses. They introduce five key improvements and demonstrate superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, validating their approach at scale with models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters....
