summary: The authors present CMPhysBench, a benchmark for evaluating large language models in condensed matter physics, which includes over 520 calculation problems focusing on subfields like magnetism and superconductivity. They also introduce the SEED score to provide more accurate assessments of the models' similarity to ground-truth solutions, revealing a significant capability gap in these models for this domain....
