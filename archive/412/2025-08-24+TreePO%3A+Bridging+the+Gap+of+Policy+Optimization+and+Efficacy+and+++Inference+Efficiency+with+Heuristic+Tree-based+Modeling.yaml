summary: The study presents TreePO, a new algorithm that improves the efficiency of policy optimization and inference by using a tree-structured approach for sequence generation. TreePO reduces computational costs and enhances exploration diversity, resulting in significant savings in GPU hours and compute resources for both trained and existing models, without compromising performance....
