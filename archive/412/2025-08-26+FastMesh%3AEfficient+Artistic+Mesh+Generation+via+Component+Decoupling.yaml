summary: The authors present a new method for generating artistic meshes that reduces redundancy by separating vertex and face generation, resulting in faster and more efficient mesh creation compared to existing techniques. This approach uses an autoregressive model for vertex generation, a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh, and additional refinements to improve quality, leading to over 8 times faster generation speed and higher mesh quality than state-of-the-art methods....
