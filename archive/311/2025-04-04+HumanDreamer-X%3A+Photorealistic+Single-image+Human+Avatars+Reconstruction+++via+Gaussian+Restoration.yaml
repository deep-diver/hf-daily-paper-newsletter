summary: Single-image human reconstruction is a complex task for digital human modeling, often leading to inconsistencies in generated models. HumanDreamer-X, a new unified framework, addresses these issues by integrating multi-view human generation and reconstruction, thus improving geometric consistency and visual fidelity of the reconstructed 3D models....
