summary: The paper presents a new framework called real-is-sim for behavior cloning that uses a dynamic digital twin based on Embodied Gaussians to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world robot policy evaluation. This framework allows for policy development and evaluation in simulation, improving the correlation between success rates in simulation and real-world performance....
