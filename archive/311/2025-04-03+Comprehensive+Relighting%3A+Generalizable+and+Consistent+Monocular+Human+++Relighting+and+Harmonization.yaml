summary: The authors present a generalizable approach for relighting and harmonizing human images within any scene, addressing challenges posed by previous models' limitations and lack of datasets. They achieve this by using a repurposed pre-trained diffusion model as an image prior, implementing a coarse-to-fine framework, and introducing an unsupervised temporal lighting model for enhancing temporal coherence, all without additional training....
