summary: This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning can significantly improve performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks using large language models. The research compares a general-purpose model, o3, with a specialized model, o1-ioi, for the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics, showing that o3 achieves a gold medal and a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics....
