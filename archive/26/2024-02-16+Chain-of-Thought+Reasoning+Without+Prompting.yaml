summary: This paper investigates chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models without using specific prompting techniques. Instead, they explore altering the decoding process to elicit reasoning paths, and find that these paths correlate with higher confidence in the model's answer. Empirical studies show that this method outperforms standard greedy decoding on various reasoning benchmarks....
