summary: The paper introduces SPIN-Diffusion, a technique where a diffusion model competes with its earlier versions to improve itself. This enables better performance and alignment, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuning methods and even exceeding reinforcement learning techniques after the second iteration, with less data required....
