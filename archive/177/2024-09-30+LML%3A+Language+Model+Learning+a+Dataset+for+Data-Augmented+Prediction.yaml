summary: This paper presents a new approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks, which streamlines the process compared to traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. The proposed method, called 'Language Model Learning (LML)', uses 'Data-Augmented Prediction (DAP)' to automatically create queries and retrieve relevant rows from the dataset, ensuring context-aware decision-making. The system enhances interpretability by allowing users to review the logic behind each prediction, and ...
