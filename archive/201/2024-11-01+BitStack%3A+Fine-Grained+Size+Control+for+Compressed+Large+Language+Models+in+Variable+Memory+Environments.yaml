summary: BitStack is a new method for compressing large language models (LLMs) to fit them into limited memory environments. It does this by breaking down the model's weight matrices into smaller, more manageable blocks and sorting them based on their importance. This allows for fine-grained control over the model's size, making it possible to adjust the model's size based on the available memory. The method is easy to use and does not require any special training, making it a practical solution for depl...
