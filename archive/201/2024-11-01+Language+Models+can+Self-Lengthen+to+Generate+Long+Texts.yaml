summary: 'This paper introduces an innovative iterative training framework called Self-Lengthen that helps Large Language Models (LLMs) generate long, aligned outputs without the need for additional data or proprietary models. The framework uses two roles: the Generator and the Extender, which work together to produce longer responses and train the models iteratively. Experiments show that Self-Lengthen outperforms existing methods in long-text generation when applied to top open-source LLMs like Qwen2 an...'
