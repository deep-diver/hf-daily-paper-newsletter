summary: DELTA is a new method that tracks every pixel in 3D space, making it possible to estimate motion across entire videos with high accuracy. This method uses a joint global-local attention mechanism and a transformer-based upsampler to achieve high-resolution predictions. It's faster and more accurate than existing methods, and it works well on multiple benchmarks....
