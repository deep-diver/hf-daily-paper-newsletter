summary: BenchX is a benchmark framework for evaluating MedVLP methods on chest X-ray images. It includes comprehensive datasets, standardized preprocessing, and unified finetuning protocols for classification, segmentation, and report generation. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP....
