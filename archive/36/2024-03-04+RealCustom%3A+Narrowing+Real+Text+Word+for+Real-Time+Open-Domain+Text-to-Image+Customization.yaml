summary: The paper introduces RealCustom, a new approach to text-to-image customization
  that can generate images based on given subjects and text. Unlike previous methods,
  RealCustom disentangles the similarity of subjects from the controllability of text
  by gradually narrowing the scope of subject influence using a novel adaptive scoring
  and mask guidance strategy. This results in improved performance in both similarity
  and controllability for real-time open-domain text-to-image customization....
