summary: This paper presents Image World Models (IWMs), a self-supervised approach
  that predicts global photometric transformations in latent space, which goes beyond
  masked image modeling. The study shows that IWMs can be adapted through finetuning
  to solve diverse tasks and can control the abstraction level of the learned representations,
  matching or surpassing the performance of previous self-supervised methods....
