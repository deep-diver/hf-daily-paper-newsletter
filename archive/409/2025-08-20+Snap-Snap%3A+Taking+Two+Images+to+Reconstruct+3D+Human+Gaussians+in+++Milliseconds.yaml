summary: This research presents a new method for creating 3D digital humans using just two images, the front and back view, which significantly simplifies the process for users. The approach involves predicting consistent point clouds and supplementing missing color information to obtain complete human point clouds with colors, which are then transformed into 3D Gaussians for high-quality rendering. The method is fast, requiring only 190 ms on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, and can work with images captured b...
