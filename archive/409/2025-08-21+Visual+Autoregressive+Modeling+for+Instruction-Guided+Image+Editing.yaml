summary: This study presents VAREdit, a new visual autoregressive framework for instruction-guided image editing that improves adherence to editing instructions and efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods. VAREdit reframes image editing as a next-scale prediction problem and introduces a Scale-Aligned Reference module to effectively condition the source image tokens, resulting in a 30%+ higher GPT-Balance score and faster editing speed than leading diffusion-based methods....
