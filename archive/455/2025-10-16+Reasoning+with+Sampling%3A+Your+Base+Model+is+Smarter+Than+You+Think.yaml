summary: The study presents a new method that uses base models for reasoning tasks without additional training, by leveraging their own likelihoods through a simple iterative sampling algorithm. This technique, inspired by MCMC, significantly improves reasoning performance on various tasks and maintains diversity, outperforming RL-posttraining in some cases....
