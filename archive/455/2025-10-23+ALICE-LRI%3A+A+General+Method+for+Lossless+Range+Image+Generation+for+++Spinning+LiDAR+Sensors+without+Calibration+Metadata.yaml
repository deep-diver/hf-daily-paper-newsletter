summary: ALICE-LRI is a new method that creates accurate 2D images from 3D LiDAR sensors without losing any data. This is achieved by automatically determining the sensor's internal geometry, allowing for high-fidelity, lossless projection and reconstruction of point clouds. The method has been tested and shown to preserve all points and maintain geometric accuracy, opening up new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications....
