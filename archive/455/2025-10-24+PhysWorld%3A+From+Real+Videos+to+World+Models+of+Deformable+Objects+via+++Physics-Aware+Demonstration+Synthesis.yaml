summary: The authors present a new framework called PhysWorld that uses a simulator to generate realistic and diverse demonstrations of deformable objects, enabling the learning of efficient world models. PhysWorld is capable of making accurate and fast future predictions for various deformable objects and generalizes well to new interactions, outperforming previous methods while being 47 times faster....
