summary: The study presents a new framework called Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs) for model merging, which is a method to combine knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model. Unlike existing methods that focus on parameter space, FDAs work with input-representation space, providing a more flexible and robust approach to model merging. The authors also introduce a new initialization scheme and demonstrate FDAs' effectiveness through various experiments....
