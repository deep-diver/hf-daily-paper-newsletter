summary: The study reveals that visual diffusion models can solve geometric problems by transforming noisy geometric structures into correct configurations in pixel space, without needing specialized architectures. This method is applied to the Inscribed Square Problem, Steiner Tree Problem, and Simple Polygon Problem, suggesting a new approach for tackling hard geometric tasks using image generation....
