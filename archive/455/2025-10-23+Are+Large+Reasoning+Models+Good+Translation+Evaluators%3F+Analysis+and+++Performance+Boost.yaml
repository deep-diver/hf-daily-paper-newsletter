summary: This study explores the use of large reasoning models (LRMs) in evaluating machine translation quality, identifying challenges such as the need for tailored evaluation materials and issues with scoring mechanisms. The researchers propose a solution to calibrate LRMs using synthetic thinking trajectories, which significantly reduces thinking budgets and improves evaluation performance across different LRM scales....
