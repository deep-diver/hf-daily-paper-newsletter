summary: This paper proposes a new method called MART to enhance the performance of embodied agents by fine-tuning a multimodal language model to retrieve and prioritize task-relevant trajectory data based on their effectiveness. The method also introduces Trajectory Abstraction, which uses the summarization capabilities of the language model to represent trajectories with fewer tokens and preserve key information. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves task success rates in uns...
