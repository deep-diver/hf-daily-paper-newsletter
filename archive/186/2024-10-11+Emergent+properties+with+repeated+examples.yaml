summary: In this paper, we explore the impact of repetition on transformer models' performance using algorithmically generated datasets. We find that models trained on smaller sets of repeated examples outperform those trained on larger sets of single-use examples, and two-set training, which involves repeated use of a small random subset of examples, leads to faster learning and better performance. This suggests that the benefits of repetition can outweigh those of data diversity, and it provides a cont...
