summary: The paper proposes a new method called MotionGS for reconstructing dynamic scenes in 3D. It uses motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians, which helps to simulate the motion of dynamic objects. This method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative results....
