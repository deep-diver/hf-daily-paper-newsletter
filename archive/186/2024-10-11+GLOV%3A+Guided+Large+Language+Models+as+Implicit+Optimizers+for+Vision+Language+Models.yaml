summary: In this paper, we present a new method (GLOV) that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the performance of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on downstream vision tasks. We guide the LLM to generate suitable prompts for the VLM and rank them based on their effectiveness. We also use an offset vector to steer the LLM towards generating language that the VLM prefers. We test our method on 16 datasets and show that it can improve performance by up to 15.0% and 57.5% on average for dual-encoder a...
