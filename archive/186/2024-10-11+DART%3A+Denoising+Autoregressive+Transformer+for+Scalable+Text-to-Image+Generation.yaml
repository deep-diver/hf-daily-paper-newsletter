summary: We present DART, a transformer-based model that combines autoregressive and diffusion techniques to generate high-quality images. Unlike traditional diffusion models, DART does not rely on image quantization and can train with both text and image data in a unified model. This approach offers a more efficient and scalable alternative for image synthesis, demonstrating competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks....
