summary: This paper introduces Rectified Diffusion, a method that simplifies the training procedure of previous rectified flow models while achieving better performance and lower training cost. It argues that straightness is not the primary target for rectification and that the success of rectification primarily relies on using a pretrained diffusion model to obtain matched pairs of noise and samples. It also highlights that the more critical training target is to achieve a first-order approximate ODE pa...
