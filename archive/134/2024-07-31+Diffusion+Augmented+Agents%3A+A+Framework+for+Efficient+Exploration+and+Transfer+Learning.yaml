summary: This paper proposes a new framework called Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG) that uses large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning for embodied agents. DAAG augments the agent's past experience by using diffusion models to transform videos in a consistent way to align with target instructions, and a large language model orchestrates this process without human supervision. The framework reduces th...
