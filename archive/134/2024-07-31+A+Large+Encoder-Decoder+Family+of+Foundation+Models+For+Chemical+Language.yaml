summary: 'A new model called Large Encoder-Decoder Family of Foundation Models for Chemical Language was introduced. It''s trained on a huge dataset of SMILES samples from PubChem. This model is good at predicting certain properties of chemicals and can perform different complex tasks. It has two versions: one with 289 million parameters and another with 8 times more. The model''s performance is better than other models in various tasks, and it can learn quickly from a small amount of data....'
