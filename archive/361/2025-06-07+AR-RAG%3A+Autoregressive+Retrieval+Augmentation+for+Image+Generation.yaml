summary: The authors present a new method called AR-RAG for improving image generation by using real-time searches at each step of the process, allowing the model to adapt and avoid issues like copying and bias. They propose two frameworks, DAiD and FAiD, for implementing AR-RAG and demonstrate its superiority over existing models in various benchmarks....
