summary: The authors present budget guidance, a new method to manage the reasoning process of large language models (LLMs) by using a lightweight predictor to model a Gamma distribution over the remaining thinking length during next-token generation. This approach allows for natural control of thinking length and significant token efficiency improvements on challenging math benchmarks, with up to a 26% accuracy gain on the MATH-500 benchmark under tight budgets compared to baseline methods....
