link: https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.12953
summary: This study presents a new method called PatchInstruct that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for accurate and simple time series forecasting without needing much training or complex external architecture. PatchInstruct improves forecasting quality by using time series decomposition, patch-based tokenization, and similarity-based neighbor augmentation, requiring minimal data preprocessing....
