summary: The researchers created a new, efficient model called MiniMax-M1 that can handle long inputs and complex tasks by combining a hybrid architecture with a lightning attention mechanism. They also introduced a new reinforcement learning algorithm, CISPO, which improved training efficiency, enabling full training of MiniMax-M1 on 512 GPUs in just three weeks....
