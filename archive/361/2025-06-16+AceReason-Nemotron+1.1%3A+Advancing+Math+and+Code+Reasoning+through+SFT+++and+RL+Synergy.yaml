summary: The study explores the combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning models, finding that a stronger SFT model leads to better final performance after RL training, and that a balanced sampling temperature is crucial for effective exploration and exploitation. The resulting AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model outperforms previous versions and achieves state-of-the-art performance on math and code benchmarks....
