summary: This study presents a new method to create diverse and complex instruction data for large language models by using attributed grounding, which involves grounding real instructions to situated users and synthesizing new instructions based on web documents. The researchers built a dataset of 1 million instructions and showed that models trained on it outperform others on common benchmarks, with performance improvements that increase with more web data....
