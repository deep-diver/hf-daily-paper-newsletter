summary: The authors present SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient reinforcement learning framework designed for Vision-Language-Action models. This framework improves long-horizon planning, outperforms supervised fine-tuning, and reduces the need for large-scale data, while also identifying a new phenomenon called 'pushcut' during training....
