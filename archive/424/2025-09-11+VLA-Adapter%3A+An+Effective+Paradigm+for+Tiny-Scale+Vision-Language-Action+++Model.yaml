summary: The researchers propose VLA-Adapter, a new method that enhances the performance of vision-language-action models without requiring extensive pre-training or large-scale models. This approach uses a lightweight model with a special attention mechanism to connect visual and language information to actions, resulting in state-of-the-art performance and fast inference speeds, all while being trained quickly on a single GPU....
