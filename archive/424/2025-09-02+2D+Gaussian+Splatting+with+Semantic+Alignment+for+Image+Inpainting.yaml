summary: This study presents a new method for image inpainting using 2D Gaussian Splatting, which creates a smooth and continuous representation of images. The method uses a differentiable process to fill in missing parts of an image while maintaining overall context and detail, and it incorporates features from a pretrained model to ensure the filled-in content matches the surrounding scene....
