summary: This study tests CodeBERT's ability to find bugs in both open-source and industrial software, then creates AI-DO, a tool that uses CodeBERT to detect and pinpoint vulnerabilities during code review in a CI/CD pipeline without interrupting workflows. The researchers found that models trained on industrial data perform well in the same domain but struggle with open-source code, while models fine-tuned on open data with undersampling techniques improve vulnerability detection....
