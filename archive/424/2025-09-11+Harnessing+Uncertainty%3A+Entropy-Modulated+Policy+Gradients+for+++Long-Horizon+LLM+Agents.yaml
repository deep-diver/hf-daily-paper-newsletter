summary: The study presents a new framework, Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), that improves learning efficiency and stability in long-horizon tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs) by adjusting updates based on step-wise uncertainty and task outcomes. EMPG outperforms existing methods in experiments on complex agent tasks like WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search....
