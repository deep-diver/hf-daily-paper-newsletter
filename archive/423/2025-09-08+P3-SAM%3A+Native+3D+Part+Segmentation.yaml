summary: The study presents P3-SAM, a model for fully automated segmentation of 3D objects into parts, which improves upon existing methods by providing precise results and strong robustness for complex objects. The model uses a feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, and is trained on a large dataset of 3.7 million models, achieving state-of-the-art performance....
