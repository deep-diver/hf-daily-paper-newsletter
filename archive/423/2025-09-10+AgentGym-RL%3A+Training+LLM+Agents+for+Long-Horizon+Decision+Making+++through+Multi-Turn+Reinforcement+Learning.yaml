summary: The authors present AgentGym-RL, a new framework for training LLM agents in complex, real-world tasks using reinforcement learning, without relying on supervised fine-tuning. They also introduce ScalingInter-RL, a training approach that balances exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to develop diverse problem-solving strategies. The framework has been extensively tested and shown to perform well across various environments....
