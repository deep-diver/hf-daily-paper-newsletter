summary: The researchers developed a framework called StyleMM that creates stylized 3D face models based on user-provided text descriptions. It uses a pre-trained network and a texture generator, and fine-tunes them with stylized facial images to preserve facial attributes while changing the style. The result is a model that can generate stylized face meshes with control over shape, expression, and texture, outperforming existing methods....
