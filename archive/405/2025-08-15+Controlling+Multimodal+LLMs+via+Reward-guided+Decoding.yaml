summary: This study presents a new method for controlling Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by guiding their decoding process with rewards, specifically improving their visual grounding. The method involves creating reward models to control the accuracy and completeness of object descriptions in the model's output, providing users with on-the-fly control over the balance between object precision and recall during image captioning tasks....
