summary: The study evaluates and compares various fusion strategies and normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth observation data. The researchers then propose MAESTRO, a modified version of the Masked Autoencoder, which incorporates optimized fusion strategies and a new normalization scheme that uses a spectral prior as a self-supervisory signal, achieving state-of-the-art results on several Earth observation datasets....
