summary: This paper proposes a concept encoding-decoding mechanism to explain in-context learning (ICL) in transformers. The mechanism involves the model encoding different latent concepts into distinct, separable representations and building conditional decoding algorithms. The quality of concept encoding is causally related and predictive of ICL performance. The mechanism is validated across pretrained models of varying scales and through controlled finetuning....
