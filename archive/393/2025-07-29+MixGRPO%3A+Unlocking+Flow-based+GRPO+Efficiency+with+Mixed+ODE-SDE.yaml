summary: The study presents MixGRPO, a new framework that combines stochastic and ordinary differential equations to enhance the efficiency of GRPO in aligning image generation with human preferences. MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism to reduce optimization overhead and supports higher-order solvers for faster training, resulting in significant improvements in training time and performance compared to existing methods....
