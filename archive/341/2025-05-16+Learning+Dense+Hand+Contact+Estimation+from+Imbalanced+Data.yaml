summary: The authors present a framework to predict dense hand contact estimation from imbalanced data, addressing class imbalance by using balanced contact sampling and spatial imbalance through vertex-level class-balanced loss. This method allows for effective learning of hand contact estimation without being affected by imbalance issues....
