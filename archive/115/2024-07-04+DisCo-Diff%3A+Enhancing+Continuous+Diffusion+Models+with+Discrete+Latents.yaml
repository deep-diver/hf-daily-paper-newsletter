summary: DisCo-Diff is a new approach that simplifies diffusion models by introducing discrete latent variables. It improves model performance on various tasks, including image synthesis and molecular docking, and achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler....
