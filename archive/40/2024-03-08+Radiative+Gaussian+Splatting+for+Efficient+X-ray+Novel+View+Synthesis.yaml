summary: The paper introduces X-Gaussian, a framework for efficiently generating X-ray
  images from different viewpoints. It uses a 3D Gaussian splatting-based model and
  a differentiable radiative rasterization technique to achieve faster training and
  inference times, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 6.5 dB. The method has
  practical applications in sparse-view CT reconstruction and the code and models
  will be available at <https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/X-Gaussian>....
