summary: This paper introduces the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal
  models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The models are based
  on large pretrained language models and are extended to chat models, long context
  models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. The models achieve strong
  performance on various benchmarks and are attributed to the high quality of the
  data used for pretraining and finetuning....
