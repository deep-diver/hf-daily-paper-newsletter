summary: In this paper, we introduce PixArt-\Sigma, a Diffusion Transformer model~(DiT)
  capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution. PixArt-\Sigma represents
  a significant advancement over its predecessor, PixArt-\alpha, offering images of
  markedly higher fidelity and improved alignment with text prompts. A key feature
  of PixArt-\Sigma is its training efficiency. Leveraging the foundational pre-training
  of PixArt-\alpha, it evolves from the `weaker' baseline to a `stronger' model via
