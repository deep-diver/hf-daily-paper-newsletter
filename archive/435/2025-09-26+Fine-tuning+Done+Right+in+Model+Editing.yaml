summary: This study challenges the belief that fine-tuning is ineffective for model editing, attributing previous failures to adapting it to a sequential depth-first pipeline. The researchers propose LocFT-BF, a localized editing method that restores fine-tuning to a standard breadth-first pipeline, significantly improving its effectiveness and outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various LLMs and datasets....
