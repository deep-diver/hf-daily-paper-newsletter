summary: The study reveals that Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR), a powerful method for visual generation, is mathematically similar to a discrete diffusion process when using a specific attention mask. By applying this understanding, the researchers improve VAR's efficiency and performance, resulting in faster convergence, lower inference costs, and better reconstruction, all while maintaining its scalability and computational benefits....
