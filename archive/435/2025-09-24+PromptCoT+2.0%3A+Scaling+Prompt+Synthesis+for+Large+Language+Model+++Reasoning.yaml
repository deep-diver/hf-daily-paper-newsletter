summary: The study presents PromptCoT 2.0, a framework that improves the process of creating challenging and diverse problems for large language models, which helps them to reason better. The new framework uses an iterative method to refine problem-solving steps, resulting in more difficult tasks compared to previous methods. This leads to improved performance in self-play and supervised fine-tuning for language models, setting new records for tasks like Olympiad mathematics and competitive programming....
