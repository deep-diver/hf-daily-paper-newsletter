summary: The study presents a flexible and practical solution for locating distant objects using particle filters, which is particularly useful in safety-critical surveillance tasks like drone-based wildfire monitoring, where other methods like dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction are not feasible due to computational limitations or distant objects....
