summary: The researchers propose UniVid, a framework that uses a pre-trained video generation model to handle various image and video tasks without needing modifications for each task. They show that UniVid can work with different types of data and switch between understanding and generating tasks, demonstrating the potential of pre-trained video models for unified vision modeling....
