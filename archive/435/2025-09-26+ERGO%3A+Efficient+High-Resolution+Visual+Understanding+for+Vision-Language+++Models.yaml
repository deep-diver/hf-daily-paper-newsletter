summary: The ERGO model presents a two-stage 'coarse-to-fine' reasoning pipeline for vision-language tasks that reduces computational cost by first analyzing a downsampled image to identify relevant regions, then processing only these regions at full resolution. It uses a reinforcement learning framework to determine where to focus, accounting for perceptual uncertainty and delivering higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods....
