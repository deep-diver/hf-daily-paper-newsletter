summary: This study addresses the issue of reward over-optimization in policy models by focusing on reward misspecification in the high-reward tail. The researchers propose a rubric-based reward modeling approach, which effectively mitigates reward over-optimization and improves large language model post-training, by leveraging off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts....
