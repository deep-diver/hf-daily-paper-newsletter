summary: The study addresses the instability in training reinforcement learning models by proposing a new method called Quantile Advantage Estimation (QAE). QAE replaces the mean baseline with a group-wise K-quantile baseline, which helps in stabilizing entropy, improving credit assignment, and achieving consistent performance gains in large language models....
