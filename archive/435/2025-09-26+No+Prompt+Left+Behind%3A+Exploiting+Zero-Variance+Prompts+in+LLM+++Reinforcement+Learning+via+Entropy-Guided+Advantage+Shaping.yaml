summary: This study proposes a new method called RL-ZVP that makes use of 'zero-variance prompts' in training large language models, which were previously ignored. The new method outperforms existing techniques by rewarding correctness and penalizing errors in these prompts, leading to significant improvements in accuracy and pass rate on various math reasoning benchmarks....
