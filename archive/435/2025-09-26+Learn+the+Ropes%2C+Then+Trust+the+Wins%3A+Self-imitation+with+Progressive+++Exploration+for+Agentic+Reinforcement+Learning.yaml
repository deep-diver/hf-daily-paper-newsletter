summary: The study presents a new method called SPEAR to improve the training of agentic LLMs in reinforcement learning tasks. SPEAR is a curriculum-based self-imitation learning recipe that helps balance exploration and exploitation by gradually adjusting the policy evolution and managing the entropy trend, leading to more stable and efficient training....
