summary: 'The study presents a new approach for language models that uses latent variables to represent thinking processes and improves them through variational inference. This method unifies variational inference with RL-style techniques, resulting in stable objectives that enhance the reasoning skills of language models. (In simpler terms: The researchers developed a method that improves language models'' ability to think and reason by using hidden variables and a mathematical approach called variational...'
