summary: The paper introduces MolSpectra, a method to improve 3D molecular representation pre-training by incorporating energy spectra, which capture quantum mechanical effects missed by classical mechanics-based methods. MolSpectra uses SpecFormer for encoding molecular spectra and contrastive learning to align outputs from 3D and spectrum encoders, resulting in better molecular property prediction and dynamics modeling....
