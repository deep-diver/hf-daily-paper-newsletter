summary: Kanana is a new series of bilingual language models that perform exceptionally in Korean and competitively in English, while being more computationally efficient than similar-sized state-of-the-art models. The models were trained using techniques like high-quality data filtering, staged pre-training, depth up-scaling, and pruning and distillation, and further improved via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization....
