summary: The research presents an agent approach, TheoremExplainAgent, to create long-form theorem explanation videos with Manim animations. A benchmark, TheoremExplainBench, is introduced to assess multimodal theorem explanations, addressing the challenge of generating coherent and pedagogically meaningful visual explanations for LLMs in understanding domain-specific theorems....
