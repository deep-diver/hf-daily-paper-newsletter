summary: The authors present a new framework, N3D-VLM, which enhances vision-language models by adding native 3D object perception and reasoning capabilities. This allows the model to accurately locate objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions and perform interpretable spatial understanding, outperforming existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning tasks....
