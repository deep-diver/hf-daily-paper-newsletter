summary: The study investigates the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a framework called RLVR, which helps large language models reason better. The researchers found that a type of reward, called spurious rewards, and a method called entropy minimization, both improve reasoning performance by making the model more confident, even though they seem to contradict each other. The study also proposes a new model to explain why spurious rewards work well....
