summary: The study presents REGLUE, a framework that enhances image synthesis by combining VAE image latents, local VFM semantics, and a global [CLS] token in a single SiT backbone. By nonlinearly aggregating multi-layer VFM features and entangling them with VAE latents, REGLUE improves image quality and accelerates convergence compared to existing methods....
