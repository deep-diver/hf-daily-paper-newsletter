summary: The study presents a new method called Coupled Variational Reinforcement Learning (CoVRL) that improves the reasoning abilities of language models. CoVRL efficiently explores solutions and maintains a strong connection between reasoning steps and final answers by combining variational inference and reinforcement learning, resulting in significant performance improvements over existing methods....
