summary: The authors present AdaTooler-V, a multimodal large language model that determines when to use visual tools for problems, reducing unnecessary tool use and improving performance. They introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adjusts tool use based on a Tool Benefit Score, and create two datasets for training. Experiments show that AdaTooler-V outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, on various visual reasoning tasks....
