summary: This study proposes a new approach for self-supervised visual learning by training models to generate embeddings for predictive tasks, instead of using traditional methods like pixel reconstruction or contrastive loss. The proposed method, called Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA), achieves strong results across various tasks, including image classification and semantic segmentation, with simple Transformer architectures....
