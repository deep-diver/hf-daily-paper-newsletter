summary: The authors present VenusBench-GD, a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark for GUI grounding with extensive coverage of applications and rich annotated data. This benchmark introduces a hierarchical task taxonomy for evaluating models from complementary perspectives, and experimental results show that general-purpose multimodal models perform well on basic grounding tasks, while advanced tasks still favor GUI-specialized models....
