summary: The researchers created Nemotron-Math, a large dataset with 7.5M mathematical reasoning traces, combining structured competition tasks and diverse real-world queries to improve the quality and generalization of mathematical reasoning models. They also developed a strategy to speed up long-context training, enabling state-of-the-art performance on various mathematical reasoning tasks....
