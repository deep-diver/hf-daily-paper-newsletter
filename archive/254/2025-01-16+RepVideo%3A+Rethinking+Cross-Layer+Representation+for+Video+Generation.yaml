summary: This paper investigates the characteristics of features in intermediate layers and proposes an enhanced representation framework, RepVideo, for text-to-video diffusion models. RepVideo captures more stable semantic information and improves semantic expressiveness while ensuring feature consistency across adjacent frames. Experiments show that RepVideo enhances spatial appearance accuracy and temporal consistency in video generation....
