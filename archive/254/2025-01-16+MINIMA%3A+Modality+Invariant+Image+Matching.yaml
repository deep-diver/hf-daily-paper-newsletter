summary: The paper introduces MINIMA, a unified image matching framework that uses a data engine to generate a large dataset with multiple modalities and accurate matching labels. This dataset, called MD-syn, can be used to train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Experiments show that MINIMA outperforms baselines and even surpasses modality-specific methods....
