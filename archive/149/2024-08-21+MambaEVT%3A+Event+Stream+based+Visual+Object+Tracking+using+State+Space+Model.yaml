summary: The paper introduces a new tracking algorithm called MambaEVT that uses a state space model and a dynamic template update strategy to improve the accuracy and efficiency of event-based tracking. It uses a vision Mamba network to extract features from search regions and a target template, and a Memory Mamba network to update the template dynamically. The algorithm is tested on multiple datasets and shows good performance....
