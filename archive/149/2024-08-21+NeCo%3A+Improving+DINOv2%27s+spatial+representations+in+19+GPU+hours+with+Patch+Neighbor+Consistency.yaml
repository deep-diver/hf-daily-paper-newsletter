summary: The paper proposes a new self-supervised learning method called Patch Neighbor Consistency (NeCo), which improves pre-trained representations by enforcing patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model. This method uses a differentiable sorting method applied on top of pre-trained representations, such as DINOv2-registers, and leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU....
