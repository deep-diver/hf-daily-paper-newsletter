summary: This paper proposes a method called Non-disruptive parameters insertion (Otter) to improve the performance of large language models by adding extra parameters to predict calibration signals. Otter saves up to 86.5% extra space and 98.5% extra time compared to existing methods, and it can easily be integrated with existing inference engines with just a one-line code change. The code for Otter is available at https://github.com/chenhan97/Otter....
