summary: We present Transfusion, a method for training a model that can handle both text and images by predicting the next token and using diffusion. We train different Transfusion models with up to 7 billion parameters and find that they perform well on various tasks involving text and images, and even outperform models that simply use quantized images and language models. We also show that adding layers specific to each type of data can improve performance, and that scaling up the model to 7 billion pa...
