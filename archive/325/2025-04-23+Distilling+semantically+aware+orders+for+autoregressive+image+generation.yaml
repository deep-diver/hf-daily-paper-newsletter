summary: This study presents a new method for autoregressive image generation that improves image quality by learning patch generation order from visual descriptions, rather than using the traditional raster-scan order. The method involves training a model to generate patches in any order, and then using this information to finetune the model and produce better-quality images, without increasing training costs or requiring extra annotations....
