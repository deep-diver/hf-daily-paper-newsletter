summary: The authors present Token-Shuffle, a new method that reduces the number of image tokens in Transformer for high-resolution image generation using autoregressive models. This approach leverages the dimensional redundancy of visual vocabularies in Multimodal Large Language Models, enabling efficient training and inference while achieving a resolution of 2048x2048 and outperforming other models in various evaluations....
