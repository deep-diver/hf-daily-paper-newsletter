summary: This research evaluates the transferability of models pre-trained on full-body CT images for various downstream medical segmentation tasks. The study employs a large-scale benchmark of 87 public datasets varying in modality, target, and sample size to evaluate the transfer ability of these models. The results show that pre-training on full-body CT can be effective for modality transfer and can support strong performance in structure detection as well as efficacy in lesion detection.
