summary: This paper introduces Factorized Quantization (FQ), a new approach to improve the performance of VQ-based tokenizers in image generation. It decomposes a large codebook into smaller, independent sub-codebooks to reduce complexity and improve scalability. The paper also proposes a disentanglement regularization to promote diversity across the sub-codebooks and integrates representation learning to infuse semantic richness. The resulting FQGAN model outperforms existing visual tokenizers in image ...
