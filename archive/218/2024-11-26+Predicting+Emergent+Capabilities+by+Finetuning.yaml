summary: This paper introduces a method to predict the emergence of capabilities in language models by finetuning them on a given task, which can shift the point in scaling at which emergence occurs towards less capable models. The method is validated using four standard NLP benchmarks and is found to accurately predict the emergence of capabilities in models trained with up to 4x more compute....
