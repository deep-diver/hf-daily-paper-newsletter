summary: This study presents a new method for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) ability to acknowledge uncertainty on 675 insoluble problems. By testing 12 state-of-the-art LLMs on a dataset of graduate-level grand challenge questions with unknowable answers, the researchers found that the best models could correctly admit ignorance in 62-68% of cases. However, they observed that models were more likely to generate speculative answers when problems appeared more manageable, and there were signific...
