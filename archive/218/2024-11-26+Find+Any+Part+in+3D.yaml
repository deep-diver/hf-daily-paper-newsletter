summary: The paper proposes a new model called Find3D for open-world 3D part segmentation, which can segment any part in any object based on any text query. It trains a general-category point embedding model on large-scale 3D assets from the internet without any human annotation and achieves strong performance and generalization across multiple datasets. The model is also faster than existing baselines and encourages research in general-category open-world 3D part segmentation by releasing a benchmark fo...
